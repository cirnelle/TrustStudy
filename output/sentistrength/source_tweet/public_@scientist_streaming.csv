@neiltyson fine. Can we blame the expanding universe on their expanding strike zone  then? #baseball
@willmpolk @SPACEdotcom I'm going to try; The light pollution is awful over here :/
üòä RT @neiltyson: A reminder that in a baseball game you cannot blame an Umpire's enlarged strike zone on the expanding universe.
@neiltyson So are you saying it's expansion is a constant? It'll continue to enlarge even when the universe inevitably collapses on itself.
@neiltyson hopefully they'll come up with hologram technology that shows that box and Umpires could make better decisions if not be replaced
@neiltyson Sure you can. You might be wrong  but wrong is very popular these days.

@neiltyson would a curve ball break harder nearer or further from the equator/poles due to rotation speed differences?
@neiltyson With all the camera tech they got today  they shouldn't rely on the human eye to call strikes.
@neiltyson I wondered about that  why aren't we expanding  or are we?

@neiltyson It was nefarious light refraction that interfered with his perception of time-space spatial distance

Hello @Space_Station from ISSAbove KS-194 in Raleigh/NC USA 261.6 mi away @NASA_Johnson¬†#issabove https://t.co/SWlDAsNI1i
@neiltyson thank you !!
@neiltyson Nor can you blame it on people utilizing technological advancements which could/should take human error out of the equation.
@Wu_Tang_Finance @neiltyson a strikezone is one of many potential infinite sets.  #postmodernbaseball
@neiltyson I guess you haven't been touched by an Angel Hernandez
No  it did not cost "a few billion" @pcousteau - nor was it "wasted". Call @ESA and they will be happy to explain i‚Ä¶ https://t.co/J2Qpc2k1Tv
@neiltyson of course you can! Haven't you been watching the election? The reality itself is rigged.
@neiltyson I'm an anthropologist  not an astronomer  so the idea of removing the big bang AND having expansion is baffling.  Can you help?
@neiltyson just saw you and Bill on Stargate Atlantis. I screamed like a teenage girl.
@trillballins @neiltyson Just by making this observation  Neil has changed it.
@neiltyson So you can .. using math .. and giving enough time before it's next Plank min ! ?
@neiltyson can I blame it for my expanding waistline or recording hair line?
@neiltyson can you blame a shrinking strike zone on a contracting universe?
Any plans in Europe? @esa https://t.co/SQHsQwfxik
@neiltyson are you drunk
@neiltyson  The game and the #Universe is rigged https://t.co/II3yst4VmB
@neiltyson but can you blame the moon's gravitational influence on it being a foul instead of a home run?

@neiltyson A specific note  while the strike zone is enlarging  so is everything else  so it appears to remain the same. This is why.
@neiltyson does an infinite amount of universes mean there's one where cubs won't choke in playoffs?
@neiltyson actually  you can. It is all about relativity!

@NASA @CiaraSexton Yes. This research is important because the Federation will need the tech to build their photon torpedoes. Ask Google.
@NASA @POTUS @NASA_Orion  And as 4 for hanging out those cube-satellites - not the same  as by missiles w/multiple cube-heads. Cheaper ;-))

@NASA  You did not land on the moon. The Moon is ME. I AM GOD. I DESTROY WITH THAT LIGHT AND I CREATE WITH THE SUN THAT I AM. YOU LIED
Thoughts that pop up when your group had minimal sleep and a fall break that wasn't a break: Space üöÄ Planners. @NASA do you hire planners?

@NASA We both know it cannot have an ocean because of the flares the star blasts out into the planets proximity  so why keep saying it?
@janvanderbeek2 @NASA I believe the secret lies with gravity...it bends time/space and it is time/space that limits faster than light travel
