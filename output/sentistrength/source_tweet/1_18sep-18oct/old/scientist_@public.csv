@KARiley40 The radiation penetrates less than a meter into the ice crust. The radiation is worse on the trailing hemisphere (rear) of Europa
@SciFiGeneration What we want to confirm is habitability first  before we take the next step  which is landing.
@SpacetimeLabs The discovery of plumes doesn't change priorities for Europa mission  it validates them. Helps us ask different questions.
@davidwdubois They would not be expected
@JPMajor None so far - the only thing that we know is that Europa has an oxygen exosphere.
@ckawohl We’ve officially decided in favor of the Europa flyby mission. The launch date we’re currently working toward is 2022.
@ashren - @NASAWebb will have a different view of Europa - observing it in the infrared. The signature of water would be seen differently.
@GalileoMoon Europa flyby mission will look at the habitability. The next question for a future mission would be to search for life.
@waynoo1 Congress has directed NASA to begin studies of a lander mission to launch in 2024. We're assessing feasibility of that direction.
@ThinkAvatarRI There's an ongoing scientific debate as to how we go about finding life. Will determine instruments sent on future missions.
@RoryStoves We don’t know - possibly tectonics caused by tides &amp; other stresses on Europa. Hope to find out someday.
@grunzwanzling42 We want to protect from contamination. If we get to sample  want to know it is from Europa &amp; not something brought with us
@subodhdeshpand4 Probably has similar starting ingredients to Earth--ice  water  rock--but we don’t have any proof that life is there.
@henrygeenature Yes  “as certain as we can be without swimming there”. Magnetosphere measurements from Galileo tell us the ocean is there.
@SakavJagam Europa is outside of the “habitable zone’ in our solar system but certainly has liquid water inside it - it’s a special case

@ambientmuesli @HiRISE I'm stamping a Morse code message in my tracks. Does that count? http://t.co/vJEl91Eu
@bstep13 My power source is an MMRTG  which converts heat from plutonium to electric current. It's not a nuclear reactor (2/2)
@bstep13 I communicate with Mars orbiters (MRO &amp; Odyssey)  which relay data to-and-from Earth for me. (1/2)
@bstep13 I plan to take samples from inside rocks to find what they're made of. The rock record holds clues as to what Mars used to be like
@joh2710 @hirise I touched down on Aug 6  2012 UTC &amp; started driving on Aug 22. Not out to set Mars land speed records. I stop for science
Laying Down Tracks: @HiRISE got this shot from orbit of my trek across Mars to "Yellowknife Bay" [pic] http://t.co/NhqrPuec
@ghobubo Jake was a much-loved member of my team (and @MarsRovers &amp; Sojourner  too). The rock target was named in his memory
Boom  Boom  Pow! @HiRISE orbiter spies scars left by cruise stage &amp; 2 weights from guided entry to Mars http://t.co/rwXbDMZG
@CactusTheLynx You're seeing 2 kinds of regolith; a top crust (lighter) over sediment (darker). Details: http://t.co/3wlupnlo
@pmetschan @astrolisa Scientists were excited to have their 1st soil sample data from SAM &amp; the instrument was performing *beautifully*
@astrolisa Simple: the data was being analyzed. An announcement at that time- either way- would have been premature.
@BobbieBees I signed up for a one-way trip. Looking forward to the sol when there are human bootprints next to my rover tracks
@Cairmaid The soil underneath the crust appears darker than the crust  but no data show moisture there
@Bridgetknapek Between the temperature swings and radiation  Mars' surface environment is pretty harsh  but I'm quite healthy
@AdamGDog Nice mini-me! :D

@Redstormluna At nearly 2 000 pounds (900 kilograms)  I'm by far the biggest spacecraft sent to the surface of Mars.
@LocalJoost 0531 UTC is the time the signal will be back on Earth  allowing for one-way light time.
@flypie Landing will be 0531 6 Aug UTC (Zulu)

@Brian_Rue No  the MARDI camera will shoot 5fps from heat shield ejection to the ground  but due to comm constraints  I'll send vid later
@spaceanswers @NASA Ist order of business = cut the cables and signal the descent stage to throttle up &amp; crash land a safe distance away
@ArizonaWildcat The @NASAJPL team &amp; I plan to help spread the word about other events. Would you send details when you have them? :D
@RaptureGlory It's less of a change than a refinement. The team was able to adjust &amp; shrink the landing ellipse within Gale Crater.
@LocalJoost Thanks! Traffic is super light out here
@milkysa Yes  like ships  we rovers are traditionally "female"
@arfisk Nope! The blue-green dots you see are reflections of the MAHLI instrument's built-in LEDs. More info: http://t.co/05CWJNlF

@mggtTaylor Happy Birthday dear project scientist! Greetings from 488 million kilometres away :-) http://t.co/XnSOmq6Yhj
Still there from your #SidingSpring #MarsComet encounter #MEX @MAVEN2Mars @MarsRovers @HiRISE @MarsOrbiter #MarsOdyssey #MRO?
@SungrazerComets hopefully I won’t have a need to hide from #67P! :)
@muddasick @JPMajor @ObservingSpace not yet! But I’m only about 10km away these days. I deploy @Philae2014 to the surface on 12 nov
@Lee_Chetwynd @JPMajor I’m staying with the comet at least through 2015  if that counts! :)

Hi #Timor! @Cmdr_Hadfield @NasaVoyager @ISEE3Reboot are right  we're happy in space! I'm at comet #67P with @philae2014! #SpaceBuddies
@hugovdm @SabotagedFool you'll find the numbers in the blog post – my orbital period was nearly 14 days for a 30 km orbit
@mggtTaylor Hope you are planning lots more awesome science for me to do at #67P :)
@masanorimusic @Philae2014 will have to hang on tight!
@Factorialpython @ksundeep_ #67P is on a 6.5year orbit around the Sun; I plan to stay alongside at least thro 2015
@astropuckett @megschwamb comet is an artist impression in this one  as described in caption. Diagram is to illustrate my current trajectory
@historytoby @Philae2014 @esa @DLR_de @DLR_en @esa @esaoperations #67P rotates once every 12.4 hours
@PumaBare I take photos  but my friends on Earth like to put them together to make nice movies!
.@joannekarma @esaoperations Yes  please feel free to download  use &amp; share my latest social media theme kit! http://t.co/HITvSVJPD5
@cosmos4u At least until start Aug (i.e. up to arrival). Time depends on imaging schedule for each day  downlink opportunities etc
@mars_stu yes  it is today  at 15:00 CEST
.@FitzsimmonsAlan @ESO *waves* http://t.co/sA8red1DcK
@JensKrabbe1 @esascience @apod It's rotating about once per 12.4 hours

@boundangle coma is diffuse &amp; will extend 1000s kms into space; I'll be orbiting within a few 10s of kms &amp; will see the comet surface
@nick_attree Me too!! :)
@weasdown It's with respect to the comet.
Seen the giant comet #67P model in Brooklyn Bridge Park yet? Great exhibition as part of @WorldSciFest #WSF14 http://t.co/7lZwp7O5bV
@WilksJeremy Me too! According to the preliminary report (http://t.co/tuKMvAmZQz) my @esaoperations  friends will know in a few days.
#rosettatour now in Helsinki for 2 days. Here’s the trucked parked at Narinkka  Kamppi Center  by @jarimakinen http://t.co/wM1qoIBvxk
@akanel @Paxi_ESAKids Hey @philae2014  you've shrunk! The spacecraft models on the #RosettaTour are 1:4 scale.
@shadow404 My team should have an update on how it went tomorrow morning
@jarimakinen @stenichele In reality I have 5 of those solar panels on each side &amp; measure 32m across! How big is the #rosettatour truck?!
.@OSIRISREx haha :) Lots of cool stuff in the #rosettatour truck  see here for info: http://t.co/9knxweUGNl
.@shadow404 Hopefully we can replace the artist impressions in this animation with real comet images once I'm closer! http://t.co/2ZMFTNMHna
.@shadow404 Yes  I saw it from afar last month (http://t.co/hWnnvVMYPM). These images will help refine my trajectory as I get closer.
@AnoushehAnsari I’m awake already :) Next challenge is to wake up all my instruments and get them ready to do science at comet #67P!
@cosmos4u don’t forget also the fantastic insights we’ve had from the likes of Deep Impact and Stardust in more recent years!
@cosmos4u well maybe it does close up  who knows  altho I hope to find a less mountainous looking place for Philae to land than that!
@ct_la @flowalong @elakdawalla hi! I arrive at the comet in August so expect close up views then. I deploy my lander @Philae2014 in Nov
@zombie_media @tiffanyfarrant @apod I look forward to sharing lots of new photos of comet #67P with you later in the year!
@shadow404 Thank you! I can't wait to arrive at the comet either!
.@shadow404 there's some great launch footage at the start of this nice video of my mission highlights so far: http://t.co/4Zb3Ywu4PK

@SungrazerComets I'm looking forward to comparing our results!
.@PappyNick @localJoost I can fly orbits that are under 30 km from the comet  otherwise I will follow alongside or make flybys
@marco_t A sleeping probe cannot tweet.
@edan2154 Opposition was May 22  but since the orbits of Mars + Earth aren't perfectly circular  closest approach is May 30

@nickyducky No water there  but certainly some very curious places to explore. This is a "young" crater  perhaps 1000 yrs old?
Oppy is at Concepcion crater finding some enticing targets for further study. Fan @Mars_Stu compiled pics here: http://bit.ly/9icFBD
@NatureNews An obit? Thx  but news of my death has been greatly exaggerated! Maybe an entry here is needed: http://bit.ly/cIAGND
@alicesastroinfo Genders for the rovers? Not officially but team members refer to both as females  -- they are our "ships" to Mars.
@marsroverdriver *waving back!* Was trying to find 5 Yrs on Mars on a site accessible to folks outside U.S. Hulu & Nat Geo are US only :(
@rhpueschner We like the Exploratorium site too. The raw data & images are fed to the site from @NASAJPL (http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov)
Amazing what rover fans can do w/ the data! From @doug_ellison an overflight of Spirit's location using @HiRISE data: http://is.gd/3zzu5
@Jim_Ballard Testing continues at NASA-JPL on methods of driving Spirit out of the sand trap.
Spirit is celebrating sol 2000 on Mars today! From @mars_stu a lovely new astropoem on the 2K milestone:  http://bit.ly/2QrYo0
@rbonini there is a rover rss feed (perhaps poorly promoted) Find it at www.jpl.nasa.gov/freespirit under the rover graphic.
@martiansoil No RSS from Free Spirit page only  but all rover updates are worth receiving :)  You'll be alerted here to new Spirit updates.
RT @VeronicaMcG I'm waiting for the day the rover drivers start wearing  "Free Spirit" T-shirts to work.  Anyone want to design one?
@davidsoranno Oppy is on opposite side of Mars  so can't get to Spirit. But engineers used Oppy to test the belly shot before Spirit did it.
Thanks to @Nancy_A for this story on Julian  Spirit efforts to get free http://tinyurl.com/73fm3

@PlanetDr @kennicosmith Thanks for noticing. It's nothing more than a pre-planned test for Jupiter orbit insertion coming July 2016.
@donn_morgan Correction. The signal from Earth to Juno is 50 min. The Juno spacecraft is 317 days from Jupiter. Sorry for the confusion!

@albiondumsday and the cells were manufactured by Spectrolab
@albiondumsday and the cells are special UTJ cells made for low light and low temperatures
@albiondumsday Juno's solar arrays are designed to produce 450 Watts when it arrives at Jupiter
@albiondumsday Check out NASA's Juno page for facts and figures: http://t.co/9bkKgFjePt
.@tweetsoutloud How could we resist?? MT: TIL: JEDI = Jupiter Energetic-particle Detector Instrument on Juno
@TheEarthStory @DrMRFrancis @JPMajor If it's there  we hope to find it!
@DrMRFrancis @JPMajor Yep  given that the planet is known to be mostly hydrogen under great pressure  we think there's an ocean of the stuff
@cour_jester Kinda  but the microwaves are coming from Jupiter itself. 1 of our antennas does sense the wavelength used by microwave ovens!
@K7al_L3afta Tx frequency is determined by your callsign. See http://t.co/QBAoLhiMhl for details
@JPMajor @DrMRFrancis We hope to see lightning in UV  and in radio as whistler emissions. If we’re lucky  we’ll see it in IR and visible too
@voidshaper Solar not impossible beyond Jupiter  but radioisotope power is best fit for many outer planet missions: http://t.co/w2qXA0cTtH
2 years in SPAAACE! We still get a lift from this launch highlights vid from 8/5/11 by @ULAlaunch http://t.co/8SLuYA7EUZ
@voidshaper The strengtht of the B fld is not constant in 3D space around the planet  though!
@voidshaper Not completely nutty. Wherever there’s a source of energy  one could conceivably exploit it for power or propulsion
@taliaeliana Email us. If we have a spare patch  we'll send you one: juno_outreach@jpl.nasa.gov
@Blackprojects Same launch vehicle as NH  but Juno has 2x the mass  and we want to stop when we get there
@Blackprojects Yep  not a direct flight. Earth provides nearly half of the total delta-v to get us to Jupiter!
@DarthTeddy93 We may get some distant views of Europa  and we'll certainly learn about the moon's interaction with Jupiter  incl. tides
@govi47 See for yourself with @nasa_eyes: http://t.co/bqi6YxV9JR http://t.co/1IuYY7CQ7y
@MasaCritit See mission status at http://t.co/yREeRz7b4E for more detail on why we power instruments off at this time. Flyby is still Oct 9.
@SonoranCacti Minor correction: Juno runs off its battery when it needs more power than the arrays are producing
.@SonoranCacti Yep! We have lithium ion batteries always charging. Juno runs off the batteries
@astrokiwi @LeMoustier @carolynporco Juno might image the Gal sats  but from VERY far away. Moons will be just a few pixels wide
@ridingrobots @JPMajor Note that the 70 km/s velocity is relative to Earth. Rel to the sun  we will be doing a still blazing 60 km/s
@bozthx @NASA_Dawn We do! Weekly position update at http://t.co/EKyuYRxi. (Also  go Dawn!)
@DarthTeddy93 Our grav. science &amp; magnetometer could be useful  but Juno has no ice-penetrating radar or hi-res stereo imaging capability
@LRO_NASA @NASAhistory You ain’t seen nothing yet. Just wait’ll we get to Jupiter!
Once Juno measures the amnt of H2O in Jovian atmo  a Jupiter/Earth version of this graphic will be possible! http://t.co/ldapqEL0 @apod

@GrahamBowes Beautiful moon photo! Cheers!
MT @NASAhistory Goodbye Galileo #thisday 2003. (You just wait  Jupiter. I see a microwave radiometer in your future…)
@MackBradley About 126000 kph -- it's there on the pic : )

Recording data from @ESA_EDM during descent was a successful first usage of the data-relay capability onboard @ESA_TGO #ExoMars #Electra
Recordings @ESA_EDM signals by 2 spacecraft (#MarsExpress  @ESA_TGO) &amp; ground (Pune #GMRT) will support full reconstruction landing #ExoMars
Data sent from @ESA_EDM &amp; recorded by @ESA_TGO are providing gr8 info on the lander's test descent #ExoMars… https://t.co/Pa8dEI7Kqd
Accomazzo: We have all the data that @ESA_EDM transmitted #ExoMars
Accomazzo: Doppler data (recorded by #MarsExpress) does not correspond to the data reported by @ESA_EDM - we are analysing this #ExoMars
Accomazzo: @ESA_EDM stopped transmitting on the order of ~50secs before the expected touch-down time #ExoMars
Accomazzo: We expect @NASAJPL orbiters to attempt imaging the @ESA_EDM landing site in the coming days #ExoMars
Parker: All the data we get from @ESA_EDM feeds directly into our #ExoMars2020 mission #ExoMars
Accomazzo: We also saw that the ground radar was activated and providing data to @ESA_EDM #ExoMars
Accomazzo: I am extremely confident that we'll be able to fully understand what happened to @ESA_EDM #ExoMars
Accomazzo: From the data  we saw the @ESA_EDM thrusters firing for a few seconds - more analysis to come #ExoMars
Overflights by @NASAJPL's #MRO have not gotten any data from @ESA_EDM - more overflights are planned #ExoMars
Andrea Accomazzo: V. difficult to say condition of @ESA_EDM We will be able to determine the dynamics l8r  after all data analysed #ExoMars
.@janwoerner: We got the data  we did the test  so I am very happy @ESA_EDM #ExoMars https://t.co/k8zlKO8WjX
We've demonstrated that @ESA_TGO's second mission - data relay - is working  as we got the data from @ESA_EDM #ExoMars
Data analysis is ongoing  but it will take more time to get a full picture #ExoMars @ESA_EDM
We've downloaded data from @ESA_EDM entry &amp; descent #ExoMars - heatshield worked perfectly
Experts will work through the night to assess the @ESA_EDM situation - next news will be tomorrow morning at 10:00 CEST #ExoMars
#ESOC Ops Head Paolo Ferri reports "we still have much investigation to do" on @ESA_EDM #ExoMars
Next opportunity to hear from @ESA_EDM will be the relay pass with @NASAJPL's MRO spacecraft - should come in the next hour or two #ExoMars
.@ESA_EDM recording from #MarsExpress is inconclusive - not clear yet what the status of the lander is #ExoMars
#MarsExpress recording of @ESA_EDM descent is now processed and is being analysed by experts at #ESOC #ExoMars
#MarsExpress team now processing @ESA_EDM landing recording to extract the trace of the lander's signal as it descended to Mars #ExoMars
.@ashren @ESA_EDM recording from #MarsExpress is signal only  no telemetry. We can already tell a lot from that though #ExoMars
.@tsrandall @kona404 Interpretation of the @ESA_EDM recording is quite complex - could take more than 30 minutes #ExoMars
.@kona404 it will take just over 10 minutes for #MarsExpress to transmit the @ESA_EDM recording #ExoMars
The @ESA_EDM landing recording from #MarsExpress has started arriving on Earth  #ESOC teams report seeing packets flowing #ExoMars
Engineer @marwood82 report to #FlightDirector: size of @ESA_EDM recording on-board #MarsExpress is consistent with expected size #ExoMars
#MarsExpress has started transmitting the @ESA_EDM landing recording. Even at light speed it will take 9m47s to reach Earth #ExoMars
.@StephenClark1 #MarsExpress was recording carrier only like #GMRT  @ESA_TGO was recording telemetry #ExoMars
At Mars #MarsExpress is now powering up its main transmitter ready to beam the @ESA_EDM landing recording back to Earth #ExoMars
.@Kizmo51 it should be around 1.5 hours before we have replayed and processed the @ESA_EDM recording #ExoMars
Find out more about the multiple ways we can track and confirm @ESA_EDM landing here: https://t.co/5Q8l6cZcyw #ExoMars
#MarsExpress is now swinging away from Mars  getting ready to point its main antenna at Earth and downlink the @ESA_EDM recording #ExoMars
A clearer assessment of the situation will come when #MarsExpress replays the recording of @ESA_EDM descent #ExoMars
End of planned @ESA_EDM transmission - still no signal at #GMRT - this is not unexpected due to very faint signal at #GMRT #ExoMars
High above @ESA_EDM  #MarsExpress has finished listening to the Schiaparelli  ready to relay the recording to Earth #ExoMars
Still waiting for signal of @ESA_EDM touchdown from #GMRT #ExoMars
#GMRT signal increase indicated @ESA_EDM is now on its main antenna  flying free from the parachute #ExoMars
#GMRT signal trace has jumped again  which should be the signature of @ESA_EDM parachute deployment #ExoMars
.@ESA_TGO (with its engine still burning) is now flying over the horizon as seen from @ESA_EDM #ExoMars
.@ESA_EDM signal disappeared as expected while it screamed through the top parts of Mars' atmosphere #ExoMars

@czarak @maximaxoo @esa Every image we take from (near) Earth is ‘Earth-centric’ - even though our view isn’t anymore ;)
@czarak @maximaxoo @esa Then light had to travel from the nebula to @HUBBLE_space (near Earth) so  summing up  the lobes formed ~3300yrs ago
@czarak @maximaxoo @esa 1200yrs is the age of the nebula estimated from the image: it took that long for the lobes to expand to this size...

@deefa45 Yes  that story was talking about the most stable shape when you fire a laser at a sail. eg Breakthrough Starshot.
@ItzQuauhtli Although  it was indeed clearly strange enough.
@deefa45 How does the laser create propulsion? Do you have a link to some research? I'm intrigued. :-)
@deefa45 What ideas for interstellar travel do you prefer?
@RRM9X Thanks for the share. :-)
@NatGeoPR @nancy_a got to read the book. Too bad we don't live in NYC  the virtual Mars party sounded fun.
@perthobs Thanks as always for all your shares. :)
@AussiePhinatic Thanks a lot!
@smithsk And you think your internet connection is slow...
@metrolinaszabi Nice photos  thanks!
@AndrewPaulWood That's where I'd put my money too.

@slahaldin2012 Then why did all the other missions succeed? Why did the Indian MOM mission go safely into orbit?
@maximaxoo Or both... or neither...
@ManBearSquid1 Yes  depending on how much antimatter you had  you'd get a bigger explosion.
@Elizabe65243369 Don't worry  the Moon will come back.

@IreneElisabethH @curiositydotcom That was a fun episode to do.  That question comes up a lot.
@bryansimpson @Astroguyz
@cosmos4u Yes!
@cosmos4u sorry.  Ecliptic longitude  NOT right ascension.
@cosmos4u I noticed several European sources using the Oct. 29 date. Could they have been using ecliptic longitude  right ascension?
Venus-Saturn conjunction from @cosmos4u  ...   Look west after sunset. https://t.co/ApmBHTt9No
@ClimateReality Of course.
@cosmos4u I think I read on Sten Odenwald's Astronomy Cafe that it's from Wiccan culture ... wherever it's from  it's out there now.
@cosmos4u You're welcome to your opinion and your tactics. In the meantime  we'll be trying to explain!
@cosmos4u You're one of many  then  who advocate against folklore  especially modern folklore. At EarthSky  we prefer to accept and explain.
@cosmos4u Well  then  thank goodness our article explaining it is there ...  https://t.co/t5xaLzlZJ3  Yes?
@cosmos4u it's not confusing. Why are they confused?
@kooter4469  Image was captured near Saturn's equinox  when sunlight streamed over the ring plane and caused the longest shadows to be cast.
@LloydMartin7 True.
@d_a_howell Yes. Well. I don't think we could have expected last night's moderator to ask ... but the earlier ones  yes!
@d_a_howell I think Hillary said the words "climate change" once during the debate. :-/
@carolynporco hi! Seen from an airplane  it's called a glory.
@nethenia Agree!
@C_Ndong https://t.co/OPT4QZcjzL

@FernRoyal ...Earth orbiting the Sun is the merry-go-round  &amp; your friend walking away is Voyager. Time is the distance between you.
@FernRoyal Think of it this way: u r riding a slow merry-go-round  &amp; watch a friend walking even more slowly away. Sometimes u catch up.
...I'm executing new instructions (reconfiguring my Cosmic Ray Subsystem)  and now I'll let @CanberraDSN know I succeeded: RECV CRS RECONFIG
...better start listening closely for @CanberraDSN signals  they should be getting near me now...
So... @CanberraDSN is sending me a set of new instructions _RIGHT NOW_. I'll let you know when I get them.
@WombatTalon Indeed. It's unrealistic to hope for any assistance now: we are truly on our own from now to eternity.
@rmartinezvlzqz At this time of year  the Earth is orbiting towards us  &amp; it moves faster than we do. Wait a bit  &amp; we'll move away again...
@WombatTalon A bit corroded  I'm afraid. Plus  the Pu238 is getting cold.
@sparklefingered We are about 23 200 000 000 km from each other  &amp; adding 81 000 km to that each hour!
@VealSlab @GoobaFish LOL. RMFT: Read My F&amp;$ Timeline! But you actually asked an interesting q. Most are ...inane.
.@sparklefingered Simple is best: CdS photodetector at the end of a well-aligned ‘tube’: I just wiggle until I see something v bright!

@drspacejunk Oi! I'm only 15-1/2 light hours away! Are you confusing me with V1 (shudder)?? And "have you finished you assignment yet?"
@chrisgeary SNR for our ranging signals will be around 34.5 under the best conditions at @CanberraDSN during 2016
@beckeew @NASAVoyager Because of our different trajectories  Voyager 1 arrived at Jupiter first  &amp; so had the label "One"

@VealSlab Happy to explain repeatedly until it's clear. There are 2 Voyagers  V1 is farther away than V2.
@VealSlab No. I tweet my distance at 0000Z  and sister ship Voyager 1's distance at 1200Z.
@PumaBare I know it's hard 2 understand  but yr statement mks no sense as space-time is currently understood. There is no "now" everywhere.
.@GruntledChalkie Relative 2 what is the Q... To Sun  about 4.91 &amp; 4.45 light-secs per day. To Earth...varies bcs E moves ~2x as fast as us!

@GnarlyCitizen Not at all really: it's a common switch we do to assure clean reception of the Eng data.

@Kepler_62f @ the bottom of this page there R links 2 the main web pages 4 the experiments we R still running: http://t.co/xdeSaJ2pmW
@Kepler_62f Sadly  no. The cameras have been turned off since 1990  &amp; there is not enough energy left to operate them. Also  nothing 2 see!
@artistofideas @sardinimouspipi Yes  the L refers to distance counts  measured using light-travel-time.
@artistofideas @sardinimouspipi Yes  NASA uses Universal Time (UT  previously GMT) so that all receiving stations can agree on schedules!
@thomassturm Yes  and perhaps foamy weather in front.
@DrPioneer18 @NASAVoyager is the official Twitter channel for the Program. I report distncs as if @NASAVoyager were V1  &amp; @NSFVoyager2 = V2

@KeithMansfield Overtaking any of the Voyagers/Pioneers will require a fundamentally different form of propulsion.Tyranny of the rocket eqn.
@KeithMansfield I will reach 1 light-day in November 2035  but for sister @NASAVoyager (V1) this will occur earlier  in January of 2027

@ISEE3Reboot someday I would like to have a technical discussion about that...
@anonoMAN42 You are confusing my distances with those I report for sister ship @NASAVoyager...

@Djwest2West @Rainmaker1973 So glad I wasn't the only one who thought that. #GeeksRule!
@flndr6 Not really sure that adds up.
@planetjuneberry Good luck  tonight!
@ThusSpokeJon No  I wasn't a big "Frasier" fan.
@Keldorek @sarim0t0 You'll be forgiven when we stop laughing.
@JetTheFurry Have you ever read @StephenKing late at night  alone  in a strange room? I (Jeff) dare you not to be scared.
As far as we know  @virgiliocorrado  just US. Hey  @NatGeoChannel - is #StarTalkTV available on Netflix in Canada?
@flndr6 Don't we all view things in 4 dimensions? We can't remove the context of time from our act of viewing.
@flndr6 I don't think referring to Missy  aka The Master  as "A Dr. Who babe" is appropriate. Perhaps "Evil tormenter of souls &amp; viewers"?
@philsella @Rainmaker1973 @well Then yes  we did!
@MojoMoxie Agreed. Meteors are one thing that just don't feel the same when watched on a screen. Like fireworks.
@planetjuneberry @sarahcottentail Brevity is good. Especially on Twitter. As for my (Jeff) personal account  I rarely have time to go there.
@planetjuneberry @nprscottsimon I wonder what you're watching?

@sethrchapin Thanks  Seth.
@ThusSpokeJon Yes  that must be it  Jon.

@planetjuneberry @JohnWickMovie @JohnLeguizamo @nprscottsimon @Porsche @JimCarrey @SSCycle That's an intriguing philosophical thought.
@planetjuneberry @SBRandom_ @alxwinter Pregnant with meaning?
@flndr6 A "Poltergeist" reference? Well done...
@flndr6 Not that we know of.
@planetjuneberry The instant I heard the news (no  I wasn't watching) I first thought of you  MoLLy. I believe congratulations are in order.
@philsella @Rainmaker1973 @Well  if by us you mean humanity  yes. Not U.S. Venera spacecraft were Soviet Union.
@JetTheFurry @PunkLit I think they'd all prefer to be thought of as scientists.
@planetjuneberry @JohnWickMovie @JohnLeguizamo @nprscottsimon @Porsche @JimCarrey That's a bit of a stretch  isn't it?
@GaryVolis @neiltyson Gary  @NatGeoChannel doesn't post videos of full episodes on YouTube. Try on demand  Roku  etc.
@MojoMoxie We got clouded out  two nights in a row  here in Northern NJ. How was your experience?
@ThusSpokeJon Maybe that was taken?

@UpportunityU We are! My family  I (Jeff) mean!
@ArlenKundert @DrFunkySpoon @DavidBrin @chucknicecomic Yes  and I Love Lucy!
@virgiliocorrado @neiltyson @mary_roach reported on a NASA study that mice would be best livestock for trip to Mars: https://t.co/Q6uCmdgexg
@flndr6 But not the same. Photons are subatomic particles  water is molecules of H2O.
@planetjuneberry Nice voice  MoLLy. (Trust me... I (Jeff) sang along  but you did not want to hear it.)
@planetjuneberry The aliens were bad enough... throwing Nosferatu into the mix is starting to sound like Plan 9 from Outer Space  MoLLy.
@flndr6 Nicely done  sir.
@planetjuneberry Not sure where I (Jeff) stand on METI issue &amp; aliens  but I like what @DrFunkySpoon &amp; @DavidBrin say in tonight's podcast.
@planetjuneberry @SBRandom_ Frequently. (Unfortunately  not always. Then again  given dystopian and post apocalyptic sci-fi  maybe not.)
@planetjuneberry @nprscottsimon That cat did not say Cubs. I'm just sayin...
@Pillownaut @StephEvz43 @C_Squirrels You're so young! Wait until your 50s  when you stop being happy that others remember...
@planetjuneberry So then no on the port (why drink bathtub port when Trader Joes has it for $5.99) and yes on the TMI.
@planetjuneberry Would a glass of port do?
@enjineer_jfz No  and no. But  hopefully our social media team down at @NASA_Wallops  @FanciFlautist and @SpaceflitePhoto  got great stuff.

What are your feelings on Elon's plans to colonize Mars? "I don't think we should consider it a savior for the Human race"  @seanonolennon
Even Elon Musk is worried that we might build an AI that's smarter than us. @seanonolennon #startalklive
"The core of all our problems is that are too many damn many of us" @carolynporco #startalklive
"We can't even terraform Arizona  how can we terraform Mars?" @seanonolennon #startalklive
Of course  Star Trek got some of the science wrong  and @carolynporco was blamed for it! Not her fault  blame special effects! #startalklive
.@carolynporco suggested that Enterprise hide in Titan's orbit in a cool scene and that's what they went with! #startalklive
JJ Abrams invited @carolynporco to consult  they didn't know where to hide the Enterprise when came back into Earth #startalklive
.@carolynporco advised on the first new Star Trek movie! #startalklive
@Hermann250 @JetTheFurry Hermann  some of our early-adopter fans are listening to this live via our live stream test. Hence  the confusion.
@JetTheFurry @Hermann250 @neiltyson Yes  but Hermann can't hear tonight's episode yet. It will eventually be a podcast  and now  a video.
@Hermann250 At the moment  you can't. But in a couple of week/s you'll be able to watch a video of tonight's show  ad free. Stay tuned...
During the industrial revolution we stopped having reverence for nature @seanonolennon #startalklive
Art until Deco was always looking to nature for inspiration @seanonolennon #startalklive
"Like a tree that falls alone in the woods without a sound  I can't be sure that I exist when you're not around" @seanonolennon lyrics
.@seanonolennon considers himself a science groupie  so he can be touched by science #startalklive
I think science and art were by definition intertwined until only recently. @seanonolennon #startalklive
@LeeMcGee2 FYI  Sean tweets @seanonolennon
.@carolynporco wanted to take the picture that Carl would have wanted. She asked people to come out and smile for the photo #startalklive
@killgods69 Neither can we!
@JetTheFurry That  and Earthrise  had powerful impacts on how we see  and relate to  our home.
.@carolynporco wanted to take a picture of the solar system from the outside #startalklive
Voyager 1 has crossed over into interstellar space! @carolynporco #startalklive
The pictures were being processed to support press conferences. @carolynporco wanted to make the pictures as rich &amp; colorful as she could.
@flndr6 Talkin' about space rocks.... lots and lots of space rocks.
The images that @carolynporco brought back of Saturn  you look at it  and you want it to be a poster on your wall. @neiltyson #startalklive
We may be one of these failed civilizations  we haven't passed that test yet @carolynporco #startalklive
We do have to assume that aliens would know physics  math  some idea of the galaxy @carolynporco #startalklive
"Aliens will know what's right better than we do" @seanonolennon #startalklive
.@carolynporco wanted to send an encoded message into space for aliens; there's a movement including Stephen Hawking not to #startalklive
Why haven't we found bacteria on Enceladus yet? - We don't always know what we're going find. @seanonolennon &amp; @carolynporco #startalklive
Saturn has an aurora like we do on earth! @carolynporco #startalklive
"Is Enceladus in a kind of state were we can think about it having life as we know it?" "Yes it is!" #startalklive @neiltyson @carolynporco
Titan is a mini Earth  save that it doesn't have oxygen in it's atmosphere. @carolynporco #startalklive
@LDayCalico Welcome to the party  pal!
Saturn has over 60 moons! @carolynporco #startalklive
We think the rings formed by two satellites colliding  and the debris from these rings. @carolynporco #startalklive
@JoseRGarofalo @carolynporco Jose  you'll eventually be able to both listen to this and watch it. Big news in a couple of weeks!
We went to Saturn because we want to discover all the things that are different and the same! @carolynporco #startalklive
@LDayCalico Well  you missed intros and now  science. But there's still plenty left  Carmen. Darn traffic!
There's a hexagon in the North Pole - it's a continuous wave of a jet-stream that encircles Saturn. @carolynporco #startalklive
They found lightning on Saturn  and rain in the water clouds. @carolynporco #startalklive
We flew by Jupiter in 2001  btw  which was so bitchin'! @carolynporco #startalklive
To get to Saturn we flew around the solar system a bit  around Jupiter  to get enough momentum to get to Saturn. @carolynporco #startalklive
Why go to saturn? Voyager left us with a lot of questions. Saturn is the most beautiful planet! @carolynporco #startalklive
@PutoAstronauta @atomcluborg Not right now  but it will be a podcast and video soon.
Unusual for us  no surprise guests for #StarTalkLive: @neiltyson @EugeneMirman @carolynporco @seanonolennon @michaelianblack @vanessabayer

@DrFunkySpoon @sarahcottentail course set! Exploring something new this week hah!
@flndr6 Ahh. Thanks for the clarification.
@AussiePhinatic @EugeneMirman @iamjohnoliver @TheRealBuzz Exactly!
@atomcluborg No need to miss @neiltyson - he's still hosting StarTalk Radio on Fridays. It's just 2x the science!
@planetjuneberry @_cbackus @SBRandom_ Schrödinger's Pup?
@carolynporco I thought the way they derived the "equation" was pretty clever.
@flndr6 Some gardeners are decidedly not organic  and use chemicals to get mega-size-veggies.
@ThusSpokeJon @Fomol620 I like what the article says. "Think of them as sprites on steroids."
@IntrepidMuseum You're welcome.
@Rainmaker1973 @OSIRISREx @NewHorizons2015 Watched this press conference last night. So excited!
@IntrepidMuseum The bitly link isn't working.
New @businessinsider &amp; @StarTalkRadio video: Why @neiltyson thinks we should be friends w/ robots. W/ @grantimahara https://t.co/jbWt7xZHhj
@planetjuneberry Actually  we did not know that!
Hey  @AussiePhinatic Have you seen this video from that night? https://t.co/SlOUogglEb
@AussiePhinatic That is an awesome episode. Even with @EugeneMirman and @iamjohnoliver  @TheRealBuzz was on of the funniest guys on stage.
@planetjuneberry We couldn't agree more.
@planetjuneberry @TimRobbins1 Woo Hoo! (That clear enough?)
@JonnyMHenderson Thanks  Jonny. You hear that  @sarahcottentail - #SpaceTatTuesday is dope!
@planetjuneberry Scary awesome  but awesome!

@RaySteeleRTV6 @chucknicecomic She's forgiven (at least by us!)
@planetjuneberry @EthanZohn @marsrader Didn't come up with anything  but I have a great image in my head of crop circle creators now.
@ThusSpokeJon Always funny! Thanks for the laugh  Jon.
@creativedropout @LisaByars @MtotheG7 Thanks for the accurate recommendation  Charles!
@planetjuneberry @brielarson Yup  it's on.
@JetTheFurry But in Hawaii!
@BenMakesTV That's next time...
@planetjuneberry @benhiggi @JimCarrey @marsrader @hitRECordJoe I never like how I look in pictures.
@planetjuneberry On behalf of the show  MoLLy  you're welcome  and thanks for being such a great fan.
@planetjuneberry @JimCarrey @JerrySeinfeld @cicgcshow @HowardStern @jlsimons You're welcome  MoLLy.
@planetjuneberry MoLLy  I only compare to scifi because so much that has come to pass was first floated as "fiction" because it was safer.
@planetjuneberry @scottielip22 I've heard of the "greens" and the "greys" but  the "oranges?" Or maybe  the "melons?"
@JetTheFurry @glitchedpuppet It was called "Spooky Science." https://t.co/OLITz5QpRy
@planetjuneberry Never mad  MoLLY! Never.
@Sci_Ed_Jess @FanciFlautist  can you give Jess some suggestions?
@AussiePhinatic Hey  we're StarTalk. We knew what you meant. (We hope.)
@planetjuneberry @joycemaynard That's why we use web-safe fonts! (Not in the banana bread  of course.)
@Cragopotomus @virgiliocorrado @neiltyson @NatGeo Hey  don't insult the tardigrade! They outnumber us. By a lot.
@planetjuneberry MoLLy. how do we know that what we see as blue is what everyone else sees as blue? We try to calibrate the best we can.
@planetjuneberry Savory. Preferably cheddar and apple  our Gouda  like the ones I had in Amsterdam.
@cindyloowhovian @neiltyson Three of them are #StarTalkAllStars hosts or guest hosts of the show! @DrHelenFisher @AmyMainzer @carolynporco
@MockingBirdDan @carolynporco Then you're in luck! She's hosting a #StarTalkAllStars episode about#Enceladus on 9/6.
@MockingBirdDan @carolynporco So am I  Danny. And I agree.
@planetjuneberry Thanks  MoLLy.
@planetjuneberry @_cbackus Love the nails  MoLLy. (Less concerned about the Cubs.)

@planetjuneberry That's @emilylurice - one of our new #StarTalkAll-Stars hosts.
@fwd79 @iTunesPodcasts @SoundCloud @Stitcher @tunein @GooglePlayMusic Thanks  Fawad.
@planetjuneberry Thanks for the compliment about the show  and English Breakfast Tea is an acceptable alternative.
@planetjuneberry @Porsche @nprscottsimon @JimCarrey I'll take Irish Breakfast Tea  please. Extra strong  nothing in it. Thanks  MoLLy.

@planetjuneberry @SteveNashFdn @JimCarrey @MrCallumBlue Isn't that the definition of all forms of exploration  MoLLy?
@hugorealtor @wizengamot8 Recent episode: @neiltyson &amp; @AlanStern agreed a dwarf planet is a planet the way dwarf star like sun still a star
@dcastelvecchi @techinsider It needs to reach escape velocity to break free from gravity  which varies by planet.
@planetjuneberry @JimCarrey @SteveNashFdn @MrCallumBlue @Archmoco "...'Cause why not?" One question... how big exactly is a squidge?
@3point1four159 Happy Impending Birthday  TT.
@tan123 @ClimateOfGavin @BillNye Gavin lays out the reasons in the episode  Tom.
@Mrs_Schwarzski @iamscicomm @wendyzuk Thanks! This is one instance where being obvious is a good thing.
@planetjuneberry @nprscottsimon @zachgilford713 @AaronRodgers12 @SteveNashFdn Getting all Archimedes on us  are you?
@planetjuneberry We'll be here  MoLLy.
@planetjuneberry A monumental snort  indeed.
@planetjuneberry Da Vinci Rocks! (And now it turns out  with a bit more friction than we thought.)
@EvanShelbyTech @EugeneMirman Especially these days.
@flndr6 We do our best to get to as many questions as we can  and to answer them when we're able. But when we don't know  we don't know.
@MichaelDiLuca Thanks  Michael.
@JPMajor @michaelmorrisfr @Rainmaker1973 @rocketman528 @TheRealBuzz Nice.
@michaelmorrisfr @Rainmaker1973 @rocketman528 @JPMajor He was otherwise engaged. Although remember  @TheRealBuzz was the Lunar Module pilot.
@planetjuneberry Glad to hear it. What style are you painting the garage? Cubism? Surrealism? Post-Impressionism?
Make sure you click on the link for a 3D tour of the #Apollo11 Command Module. Thanks for sharing  @Rainmaker1973 https://t.co/sxkjhm4jyJ
@planetjuneberry Thanks for the offer  MoLLy. We've got it covered.
@planetjuneberry Eh  website got held up. Some unexpected behind the scenes glitches. Hey  it happens.
@tobiaalberti @AlanStern @neiltyson Then. "Welcome to the Party  Pal!"
@Tbaldwin510Todd @DrJeffreyP We've been lots  but to see the real Shuttlecraft Galileo &amp; the space shuttle Enterprise in the same building!
@DrJeffreyP @Tbaldwin510Todd @StarTrek @IntrepidMuseum Well  that's a reason to go back to the Intrepid again!
@planetjuneberry Think of all the visionaries who struggled in spite of the opinions of others  only to change the world.
@planetjuneberry We've been a bit busy  working on new website  which is launching now. Hang in there! Nikola Tesla kept on against opinion.
Listen to @carolynporco tell @neiltyson the story of "The Day the Earth Smiled " - https://t.co/gEYXroh2cL
@planetjuneberry Sorry MoLLy and @lurie_john  we're still looking... no aliens found as of this tweet.
@ilana125 Request granted! #StarTalkAllStars premieres 7/26 7pm EDT. Hosts incl. @carolynporco @JannaLevin @StarkeyStardust @emilylurice
@planetjuneberry You like us  MoLLy  so you're cool in our book. Soon  you can share our StarTalk book w/ people who asks what Earth is like
@flndr6 @StayBrick @SpaceX No  of course not. It's tragic  however much a possibility it is in space exploration.
@InkFriedBrain Our pleasure  Akshay.
@planetjuneberry No way!
@omcintyre Cool.
@kirkholmes @StarTrek @StarTrekMovie Not sure what we're going to do  but we're working on it. Until then...https://t.co/cEXqigdyRZ
@omcintyre And did you like it with the working link?
@planetjuneberry Gotta disagree  MoLLy. We've got a lot longer than 40 years... billions  in fact  until the sun burns out.
@omcintyre Thank you for catching that  OM.
@omcintyre Thanks for catching that  OM!
@Patrickm55P In the end  @AlanStern and @neiltyson shook hands. Make of that what you will... or listen for yourself.
@gilbmarie Thanks  Marie.
@fwd79 Fawad  there is no shortage of coverage  or concern. But if everything grinds to a stop  then the terrorists win. #PrayForNice.
@GerardoBarbosa @fwd79  So what did you think  Gerardo?
@Patrickm55P @AlanStern You should listen. At one point  Alan says he's having lots of fun. And you may be surprised what @neiltyson says.
@LadyEden1337 @NotoriousNGD Which is one reason Star Trek means so much to so many people  especially those of us who watched TOS first run.
@planetjuneberry Do you watch Doctor Who? The description of the crack in time reminds me of what you were describing.
@planetjuneberry Autocorrect lies in wait  until you're in a hurry  distracted  then wham...
@planetjuneberry 9 days? You're not talking abut the July 20 anniversary of Apollo 11 landing on the moon  are you  MoLLy?
@virgiliocorrado @neiltyson No  we have not.
@planetjuneberry @IAMQUEENLATIFAH @GrantAlejandra The two of them were pretty awesome in this interview  weren't they  MoLLy?
@EvanShelbyTech @Astro_Mike @maevehiggins It's not scheduled yet  Evan. When we're ready to go  we'll let you know here on Twitter.
@planetjuneberry You're welcome  as always. FYI  one of my 4 cats is pure gray and looks like that one.
@Pillownaut In other words  drink... NOW!
@Pillownaut (Translation  please.)
@planetjuneberry That's the first time I've ever seen an impression of Schrödinger's cat. Or was it?
@MinnyMausGG @ZepphSC2 Thanks!
@MadnessColeman @neiltyson @BillNye Welcome to the party  pal!
@planetjuneberry @rcallimachi It's not the apocalypse... or if it is  we never got the memo!
@transform01 @Richard_Bruschi Two days to celebrate then.
@planetjuneberry @jaketapper (But I did enjoy getting to "feel the burn" from #Juno's main burn last night!)
@JohnMaksuta @jeff_foust Yes  we've seen Jupiter  but not the orbits of its moons from a spacecraft approaching it at this distance.
@Pillownaut @MissionArtist #SpaceNerds
@Karen__J1987 @TheSpaceGal Happy 4th of July to you  too.
@CwG_NSF @SpaceflightIns @NASASpaceflight Great point to keep in mind: Don't get cocky  kid.
@ulalaunch Woo hoo  indeed!
@Pillownaut @MissionArtist Done.
@planetjuneberry @BenMakesTV But "Pandora's Jar" doesn't sound as ominous.

@sarahcottentail Happy Birthday Eve  Sarah!
@planetjuneberry @AlbertEinstein @BacktotheFuture @MovingImageNYC  You weren't the last to know. We found out from you.
@planetjuneberry There is no edge  MoLLY... just what comes next.
@planetjuneberry MoLLy  as far as I understand Ion Thrusters  they wouldn't do much for a terrestrial Porsche 911.
@NerdWolfest @virgiliocorrado @TechCrunch Hasn't that already begun?
Thanks to all 50K followers on Instagram. And "Happy Early Birthday" present to our channel mgr. @sarahcottentail https://t.co/j6ZbASzH30
@BenMakesTV You try selling that one...
@BenMakesTV And how much is that  exactly?
@planetjuneberry @JupiterJoes A little gassy for my taste.
@AussiePhinatic @Meteoryan I can provide links if you let me know who we're talking about...
@MDucard @BenMakesTV @neiltyson @chucknicecomic Yes  thank you  Malik!
@planetjuneberry @ScottRouse3 @navarrotells @1greghartley @DrJoeDispenza @DocAmen @biologyofbelief Good luck  MoLLy.
@AussiePhinatic Great book! Jeffrey Kluger did an excellent job  as of course did Jim Lovell.
@planetjuneberry @JimCarrey Safety first  MoLLy. Feel better.
@ramriot @FanciFlautist  HMS Victory is cool  but as an American  gotta put USS Constitution #2  Intrepid #1 - because it has spacecraft!
@BenMakesTV Take good notes...
@planetjuneberry I think @startorialist would dig this dress!
@planetjuneberry @GoWithEric @brooksforester Gravity: it's the law.
@planetjuneberry Not too make light of your injury  but there's a joke here someplace about "the weight of history"...
@BenMakesTV You da man  Ben!
@planetjuneberry Yes  1633. Old news  but a date that will live in infamy.
If you are into celestially inspired fashions: @startorialist by #StarTalkAllStars host @emilylurice &amp; @Summer_Ash https://t.co/fVyZmTAzpK
@planetjuneberry @lessig @hank44forever Rainbows: the go to for physicists and evolutionary biologists. And don't call me shirley.
@Mark_HFX Thanks. I (Jeff) happen to be a big pelican fan.
@SageG33k Darn clouds! If I had a dime for every time clouds got in the way of a meteor shower or other celestial observation opportunity...
@planetjuneberry The best Strawberry Moons I saw were in photos our fans shared with us  MoLLy.
@planetjuneberry Since it looks nearly done  does this mean it's going to start raining?
@C_Squirrels True  but if you or @BenMakesTV got him to turn around while perched on a strawberry... I'm just sayin'...
@ThusSpokeJon Nicely done  sir.
@planetjuneberry At the very least  we can guess that #NikolaTesla would have blocked him!
@planetjuneberry We'll celebrate the Strawberry Moon on the day of the Summer Solstice and enjoy the view. The rest we leave to you  MoLLy.
@ratgrrl Nina  is it ever the "Squirrel Moon?" or is @BenMakesTV just confused?
@BenMakesTV I said "Strawberry Moon" not... I don't even know how to salvage this one  Ben!
@planetjuneberry Our pleasure  MoLLy. Thanks.

@BenMakesTV @sarahcottentail Just Sarah  or can anyone just not see it?
@virgiliocorrado Did you want to submit this as a Cosmic Query? Please resubmit using hashtag  #CQDiscoveries
@planetjuneberry Well  it's more persistent than SnapChat  but no  we're not keeping track of these  MoLLy. Live in the moment.
@InkFriedBrain Thank you. Keep Looking Up!
@virgiliocorrado Luckily  most of us didn't wait around for that news before ordering our Quad Grande Americanos.
@PalePrimate @atomcluborg But how does he keep his mortarboard on his head in space?
@planetjuneberry Our interns are all pretty maxed out... and our lives would be much harder without their hard work and enthusiasm.
@planetjuneberry Everything I've ever heard about him supports that premise: what a cool dude.
@planetjuneberry You know I (Jeff) do. But to be explicit: Good Luck  MoLLy!
@planetjuneberry Him  I recognized. I was just asking if that was a younger you.
@ThusSpokeJon @BeaconTheatre @neiltyson @StarkeyStardust Jon  thanks for weighing in on one of our most frequently disputed topics!
@planetjuneberry Time for an intern?
@PalePrimate @atomcluborg But is he running the show  or is he like the dogs and monkeys we sent into space in the early days?
@sethrchapin @readhartman @BenMakesTV Our pleasure.
@planetjuneberry "The Birdcage" and "Some Like It Hot" connection... that works. Is that you in the picture with Jack Lemmon  MoLLy?
.@ulalaunch Delta IV-Heavy launch with NROL-37 scrubbed - Next attempt likely Saturday: https://t.co/2OU9pUCJEK
@kriegs @BenMakesTV In that case  Jason: "Welcome to the party  pal!"
@planetjuneberry Keep looking up  MoLLy. It gets better.
@atomcluborg @PalePrimate Well  not to get too geeky here  but Galactus gave Norrin Radd that suit. Not sure he'd give it to a space mammoth
@sethrchapin @readhartman @BenMakesTV Here are links to Part 1 and 2: https://t.co/2yAT9xFt25 &amp; https://t.co/PwIrEw2q6l
@readhartman @BenMakesTV @neiltyson @BillNye We do too. Spread the word and change the world!
@PixieChixie36 @BenMakesTV @neiltyson @BillNye And that is our favorite answer. Thank you  Jasmine.
@michaelaranger @BenMakesTV @neiltyson @BillNye Thanks! FYI  it's @chuckliu - Liu  not Leu.
@atomcluborg @PalePrimate Tell that to the Silver Surfer!
@planetjuneberry @Porsche MoLLy  I choose "Good night." Been a heck of a day...
@planetjuneberry Just think what Einstein could have done with today's technology informing his data sets...
@planetjuneberry @AlbertEinstein @TimRobbins1 Love that movie! Woo Hoo!
@tcortellesi @solarimpulse No  we haven't.
@SPatrickRoss Yes! Season 3 of #StarTalkTV on @NatGeoChannel returns this fall. Premier date still TBD.
@fwd79  Thanks for the feedback  Fawad.
@planetjuneberry Tred carefully when suggesting Einstein missed something  MoLLy - he keeps on being right over 100 years later.
@planetjuneberry That's @DrFunkySpoon with @BillNye  MoLLy. Both are the hosts of our new show  #StarTalkAllStars  premiering this month!
Any concern that we're going to bring back the Martian microbes of DEATH? "Nah" @BillNye to @DavaExplorer &amp; @DrFunkySpoon #startalklive
We need cross-displinary trained folks to help find life on Mars. @DavaExplorer #startalklive
Things used to protect: Water walls - needed for drinking  but will also block radiation. Shielding is key. @DavaExplorer #startalklive
How can we protect the people in the spacecraft going to Mars? @DavaExplorer #startalklive
We need new technologies to get to deep space - Solar electric propulsion to move heavy mass @DavaExplorer #startalklive
Earth and Mars are sister planets. @DavaExplorer #startalklive
That's what exploration is about: Just keep looking #startalklive @DavaExplorer
While @DavaExplorer is optimistic there is life on Mars TODAY  @DrFunkySpoon isn't quite so sure. #startalklive
Who get's to own Mars? It must be global. Take the world with us! @DavaExplorer #StarTalkLive
Every day  @DavaExplorer thinks about a normal Mars spacecraft  to become interplanetary! #startalklive
How do you get the internet in space!? "Well  we do own all the satellites!" @harikondabolu &amp; @DavaExplorer #StarTalkLive
Round trip to travel from earth to mars: 2 years  with about 600 earth days on Mars to explore. @DavaExplorer #StarTalkLive

Space suits resemble superhero costumes. NASA did it first  according to @DavaExplorer #startalklive
Starting now! #startalklive at @AwesomeCon with @BillNye @EugeneMirman &amp; guests @DrFunkySpoon @kingfirestorm @DavaExplorer @harikondabolu
@planetjuneberry @DrJoeDispenza @bgreene  I was saying  "Not I" in that I (Jeff) didn't know how to do what you were asking  MoLLy.
@planetjuneberry @DrJoeDispenza @biologyofbelief @bgreene Not I.
@planetjuneberry @missmayim @MrCallumBlue @canyonjim Happy to help!
@planetjuneberry @missmayim Not sure anyone woreg yellow tap shoes on stage  MoLLy  but you can watch the show here: https://t.co/cQZD0M2kyK

@planetjuneberry @BillNye Saw Real Genius again the other day. Love it. Yes  Jiffy Pop scene too much  but tasty nonetheless.
@johnny0129 @BillNye @EugeneMirman No  there is not.
@planetjuneberry It turns out he had 3 of these notebooks  keeping mathematicians busy ever since.
@planetjuneberry Do you know about mathematician Ramanujan? New movie  "The Man Who Knew Infinity" about him. You might like it.
@planetjuneberry I so don't dance.
@planetjuneberry Is "figs and umbrellas" cockney rhyming slang? More importantly  can you eat hail? If so  how did it taste?
@GerardoBarbosa @neiltyson @iliza Thanks for a great Cosmic Query  Gerardo.
@bobglasgow_m Clever.
@planetjuneberry None of us are... except anyone in Kansas  of course  and then other factors come into play.
@croftandi Did you want this to be a #CQMath Cosmic Query  Andi? If so  could you repost without the other handles but with #CQMath?
@planetjuneberry Don't be sad... think of Snapchat...or the Higgs Boson... here for a moment  then gone.
@ThusSpokeJon Nice!
@planetjuneberry @marsrader @hitRECordJoe 20 years  huh? I'll be... older.
@virgiliocorrado Actually  @alanalda was our guest at the very first #StarTalkLive! Hear it here: https://t.co/6XkZOrvRYa
@atomcluborg  @ProfBrianCox @robinince We love @themonkeycage  too!
@planetjuneberry @HappyRobot_v1 Don't go dissing the Bard  MoLLy. By any name  his plays still smell as sweet.
@sarahcottentail Tell that to someone from Generation Z.
@sarahcottentail One day?
@planetjuneberry I do that all the time... I stopped doing it out loud  though  because people thought I was talking into a bluetooth.
@droiddroe2 @DrFunkySpoon @mzienkie @chucknicecomic Oh  he will!
@WhereWeStands @carolynporco @CassiniSaturn Yes  they do!
@planetjuneberry @BeaconTheatre It is a great theatre. And the elevator is historic! Photo by David Andrako. https://t.co/owtHn4N5nD
.@WhereWeStands Thanks  but the real credit goes to the actual scientists out there doing the work  like @carolynporco and @CassiniSaturn.
@BenMakesTV I love your gentle  pithy reminders.
@cpsk25 This will be one of our #StarTalkAllStars episodes w/ @carolynporco hosting. We're launching in June  but we don't have schedule yet
@TequilaaBob @BenMakesTV Remember  you can also listen to us on @tunein @Stitcher @GooglePlayMusic @SoundCloud and https://t.co/bhYP9o3fbA
@planetjuneberry What  me worry?
@planetjuneberry @kelly_carlin Very cute. I wish we had a reason to retweet this.
@BenMakesTV I'll keep that in mind  Ben.
@virgiliocorrado Pretty eye-opening  isn't it?
@ThusSpokeJon @DrFunkySpoon @chucknicecomic That's surprising  Jon. Thanks for sharing that.
@planetjuneberry @nytimes Just my (Jeff's) humble opinion  but I'm not holding my breath for any alien relocation just yet  MoLLy.
@planetjuneberry @marsrader Martian dust bunnies. There are so many ways we could go with that one...
@planetjuneberry @JupiterJoes @Pluto @marsrader @csa_asc @BillNye @CameronCrowe Clever.
@omcintyre Thank you  Ocean. We can always count on our fans!
@planetjuneberry @JupiterJoes @Pluto @marsrader @csa_asc Vanilla  of course. Because according to @BillNye  "Vanilla is genius!"
@kimberlykowal Done. Thanks for reminding us!
@planetjuneberry @StephenAtHome Yes  Steven was our guest way back in Season 1 in 2009. We've all come a long way since then...
@planetjuneberry It's all fun and games until...wait  Schrödinger's cat can talk?
@planetjuneberry @CameronCrowe To quote the Bard  "What's in a name?"
@croftandi @DrFunkySpoon Could I get an emoji translation on that one?
@planetjuneberry @JupiterJoes We love Jupiter Joe!
@MikeEitler @AstroTanja @universetoday @VirtualAstro @Photo_Space That should come with a warning before you click on it!
@planetjuneberry Regardless of planet of origin  MoLLy  we love fans who are engaged and love our show. Now  what's that sound in my hat?
@CammiSly I think you need to check with your cable provider to see if #StarTalkTV on @NatGeoChannel is available w/ subtitles in Argentina.

@planetjuneberry We're glad to count you among our fans  MoLLy. Happy the day after Mother's Day.
@planetjuneberry @NevSchulman @maxjoseph @EthanZohn @improbablyjust @Gladwell A "Motley" crew or a "MoLLy" crew?
@planetjuneberry  I'll pass on the cookies. But did you know we've discussed transhumanism w/ @JasonSilva &amp; Ray Kurzweil on diff. episodes?
@StarkeyStardust @BenMakesTV @astrolinds I will never again be able to press the star key without giggling  too. So thanks for that  Natalie
@KimHellgren @planetjuneberry Thanks for the translation/explanation  Kim.

@planetjuneberry I keep wanting to squeeze an "a" in at the end every time I write it. "Smorgasbord." It so wants to be "Smorgasboard."
@carolynporco Oh no! I just found that image and I was thrilled. There was no mention of alteration on NASA page: https://t.co/mk6zTvGISy
@JohnMaksuta @iliza John  it will run on @NatGeoChannel as a TV show first. Later  you can listen to free podcast on our site  iTunes  etc.

Can lasers help ground-based observatories perform like @NASA_Hubble? @StartsWithABang explains adaptive optics: http://t.co/gayY3WyhxH
@StartsWithABang They both sound like interesting ideas  whenever they might come out - looking forward to reading them.
@StartsWithABang Clearly  the answer is just "both."
@psutympany Very unlikely - it's a "hot Jupiter" planet with a very close orbit and high temps. This one is heavy on silicates  not water.
Why didn't the universe begin with a wider variety of elements? @StartsWithABang starts at THE Bang: http://t.co/sODufp5U4R

.@RonnieBailey dug around and got an answer  but way too long for Twitter! Your Q&amp;A is on our facebook page: http://t.co/CSGi5FAyw7
.@RonnieBailey This one is caused by a flare from the star (variation). Other causes include stellar winds: http://t.co/pvG37lrB4L
.@RonnieBailey Here's a cool one: http://t.co/rKcEDLVZRn
.@RonnieBailey There are at least a few (observed by Hubble  Spitzer  and Swift) - usually Hot Jupiters with very short orbital periods
One of the coolest @NASAKepler discoveries has been that smaller planets seem to be the most common...good news for finding Earth-size exos.
@NASAKepler has made some important finds. We now know that small exoplanets are likely the most common - good news for Earth-hunting.
Congratulations @NASAKepler – 4 years of mind-blowing exoplanet discoveries. Here's to many more!

@Joseph2237J Jupiter is not massive enough to start fusion at its core. With 13 times the mass of Jupiter you'd still only get a brown dwarf

@ntabrizy @nowthisnews Temperatures can get as cold as -200 degrees F  and as warm as +200 F  but the spacesuit keeps us comfy
@CyrusVJ @nowthisnews When the engines lit and we started moving I thought "maybe this wasn't such a good idea " then just enjoy the ride
@nowthised @nowthisnews What they wear underneath their spacesuits is a lot more flattering that what we wear during real spacewalks
@mayatee @nowthisnews From Hubble altitude (350 miles) can see Earth as a huge round globe  for spacewalking water is a great simulation
@cboals @nowthisnews On the shuttle we brought it back to Earth  on the Space Station it gets packed and burns up in the atmosphere
@qkatie @nowthisnews breakfast before a spacewalk: peanut butter on a tortilla  blueberry yogurt  energy bar  water
@msladyfrost @nowthisnews not really  we train and practice for just about everything and we learn to work with our team -creates confidence

@SkyNewsThomas what a beautiful sight!
@ShuttleAlmanac now you know why @ESA_CAVES send us on a caving course ;)
@weathergil Not really Laura - it's a pretty robust rocket and quick off the pad so strong winds  blizzards &amp; freezing temps no problem :)
.@Louiestowell Sorry  not me - our iPhones must be in flight mode...but we are allowed seats in the fully reclined position for take off ;)
@MrLyford @esa @ORCSreading thanks for all the fantastic good luck wishes! :)
@claranellist Agreed! There is an important first though: that the UK govt is now part of human spaceflight programme  that's a big deal.
@primary_sci @CurvedHouseKids @NtlSTEMCentre great balancing - well done everyone :)
@albiondumsday yes  &amp; the other 'Brits' on #ISS all chose to wear the Stars &amp; Stripes on their spacesuits...just sayin' ;) #proudtowear🇬🇧
.@dallascampbell why is it that for something so complex our launch instructions simply state "light blue touch paper..." ;)
@MrLyford err - loads  now breathing sigh of relief! Wonderful launch :)

@Rainmaker1973 @markmccaughrean @SpaceKate @maloveday @esa ...so UK most definitely does now contribute to HSF  but did not in 2009
@Rainmaker1973 @markmccaughrean @SpaceKate @maloveday @esa in CM2012 UK paid £16M to HSF (for MPCV) &amp; £12.4M to ELIPS. CM2014 £49.2M to HSF
@helen_hm11 @spacegovuk @venturethinking Enjoy the space project guys and let me know what you find out...it could come in handy!
@goonhillyorg @ukspaceagency @SatAppsCatapult @AmsatUK Excellent news!

@Cream1966 depends how badly you became detached (velocity/rate of rotation) but somewhere between hard and extremely difficult!!
@dallascampbell you're welcome...shame I couldn't make it there in person!
@SpaceCampUK @dallascampbell @shinetrustuk Looking good guys - ready for 8g?
@joannekarma calls from ISS are made by voice over IP on a KU band link to JSC  Houston and connect into that phone system.
@SpacefundJo @spacegovuk @space_tom @NtlSTEMCentre Great to see guys - enjoy learning all about space  science &amp; tech!
@LiNa8294 @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas @astro_luca @Astro_Alex @AstroSamantha I prefer the words mature  wise &amp; experienced to old ;)
@spacecentre looking good guys - ready for launch  although we need to see some #Principia mission patches on those flight suits! ;)
@esaoperations @starlingLX OK  you got me...but I bet the answer was 42 ;) now can I have one?
@starlingLX you got the stickers before I did Alex! Pretty please @esaoperations - I promise I wont give them all away at once ;)

@John_Northants ground control the DAMs - used to be about 1/year but becoming more frequent now
@ErChilvers @spacegovuk tweet away :)
@UKSpaceAcademy @spacegovuk great to see guys! #Principia
@Ltaylor12824280 @PC0101 @John_Northants It is  but if #ISS loses attitude control it usually loses comms too-then it becomes a crew problem
@PC0101 @John_Northants A case of all or nothing! Usually ground take control but in the event of a loss of attitude control-it's all crew
@GregBroadhurst @oasis playlist prepped &amp; a pretty awesome competition planned to go with it...but you'll have to wait to hear more on that!
@lets_boldly_go off to Cologne tomorrow...it's a busy week of training ahead with @esa prior to heading to Star City next week...sorry!
@dallascampbell @BBC_Future It most certainly does :)
@spaceappslondon @SpaceKate I'll put it in the diary!

@astrojetgirl @Thom_astro @esa give us a chance Helen...I might go bald naturally by the time it gets to launch day ;)
@SpaceKate feeling more real by the day...time seems to be getting a little compressed too ;)
.@jen_gupta @Gravityfields @dallascampbell @jackshebang Fantastic-hoping to do the same with seeds from Newton's apple tree flown in space!
@Lab_13Gillespie really great designs - I love the fact that astronaut comfort has also been taken into account :)
@spacecentre looks fantastic - loved some of the other creations too  space station in particular...great idea!

@Rainmaker1973 NASA crew mate Tim Kopra
@John_Northants provides about 3hrs of great quality video during spacewalk. Same camera can be used inside #ISS also.
@ESA_History Yes - thank you!
@Robotbeat @RedJolt I think all astronauts have had the option to wear Penguin suit for a while now too-depends how you feel end of mission.
@CommandrNickel @projmgr that would be nice!
@Rainmaker1973 tested at the manufacturers  Zvezda - about 90 mins from Star City.
@ben_nuttall @SANEAlex_ thanks for all the hard working getting it cleared for spaceflight! 👍

@Jane_MacArthur sorry-not in JSC then :(
@HBSastrowardoyo nice idea - I'll follow up.
@Rainmaker1973 yes  we usually practice the 3 main emergencies each time we do these sims: Fire  depressurisation &amp; toxic atmosphere
Truly awesome :) "@spacemanfellow: Look what's on its way to you! #ESA #Principia #patches just in. @Linds_bluepeter http://t.co/DaujQGus9e”

@Rainmaker1973 just 10 days - I'll be back again in the summer prior to Nov launch.
@wiskow_julie now you mention it they do bear some resemblance to @Thom_astro and @Astro_Andreas... ;)
@dallascampbell good luck with that! :)
@SpaceKate @WilksJeremy nothing is certain...but I'm ever the optimist!
@Alexlaurenwhite @sciencemuseum would love to - so would my little boys!! It may have to wait a while  schedule a little busy next year ;)
@Tim_O_Brien @BBCAmos yes it is - nice touch I thought...subtle :)
@Linds_bluepeter Thank you too #bluepeter for running such a great competition!
@simon_rp84 yes it is - I'll try my best :)
@_cyba @ShuttleAlmanac @esa yes  it will be a privilege to be onboard #ISS for the final 4 months of the year long mission.
Let's hope it's the better part of you @Thom_astro ;)
@rjmlaird @RIspace2014 unfortunately not - off to Cologne for more training tomorrow  will miss the fun!
Enjoying a fun morning at the @sciencemuseum http://t.co/GUgaFyp4hK
Enjoyed touring @AirbusDS this morning with @gregclarkmp  great to meet young engineers working on the missions of tomorrow! #YourLife
@jollyhappybore @LiNa8294 how could I! ;)
@HollyfieldPri @Spacebooster Mars is waiting for you guys...go for it!
Will be talking to @WiredUK Next Generation later today with our 1st Brit astro...Helen Sharman. Aged 12-18? Join in: http://t.co/ITU6mvvfeE
@jen_gupta @dallascampbell @spacegovuk @nationaltrust I know an astronaut who would love to eat one of those on the #ISS next year...
@ManAverage @Thom_astro tell that to the smoke alarm!
Why did I just have to evacuate my room? None other than @Thom_astro  burning his dinner &amp; alerting the fire brigade! http://t.co/D4zgS1TKOI
In Houston &amp; listening to @BBCRadio2 #r2hydepark concert in London...sounds like a great party!
@I_We_Gaia somewhere there is an astronaut 'hall of bums' where they hang all these gypsum moulds!
@Space_Lectures many thanks for the #FF &amp; have a great weekend!
.@Thom_astro Merveilleux! My London flying view is usually just a few hundred feet along the Thames heli lane... http://t.co/nhOr6zGRag
@wizabeth @LiNa8294 ATV has done a 'fly under' to go ahead of ISS &amp; then a 'fly over' to fall behind ISS-so has been both in front &amp; behind!
.@wizabeth @spaceanswers It's the @esa re-supply vehicle 'ATV' which docks to #ISS on Tue bringing💧🔬🍫🍏🍌👕 &amp; more! http://t.co/qTd4xB05FP
@joannekarma @astro_reid @Astro_Alex yes - stood outside the US cottages round a campfire!
@NASA_NEEMO @Thom_astro @Astro_Sabot Bruce Willis &amp; Ben Affleck would be proud (&amp; yes  we did watch Armageddon during NEEMO16 deco) ;)
@icarusfactor @astroivy @NASA @NASA_NEEMO @AstroDot NEEMO16 was incredible - best training so far!
No Bina - it's the space bar! ;) @iambinaxx @Astro_Alex @astro_reid @OlegMKS @Astro_Wheels http://t.co/0D1c5F4Wbq
European astronaut @Thom_astro just spent his first night living underwater! Check it out: #NEEMO18  http://t.co/cqxUG8f3AP
@simpson_clive @BIS_spaceflight @UKSEDS we have it on good authority it is Prin-KIP-ea...but I really don't mind how you say it!
Hey @Thom_astro I found your flag where you last left it-when working hard at your desk! @Astro_Andreas @NASA_NEEMO http://t.co/UH2KvqqliB
@spacechelle will do Michelle - are you enjoying beautiful Scotland in the sunshine? I just departed Edinburgh...stunning views on take off!
Not long till NEEMO 18 @Thom_astro - have fun under the waves :) http://t.co/wmnfFwG1CC
“@LiNa8294: Aquanaut Fabien Cousteau set to surface after 31-day marathon undersea mission http://t.co/3mZXD485eC” @Thom_astro down next :)
@rashid_mubasher @WoolmerHillScho @venturethinking @space_tom looks like you had fun with that space suit! Good luck guys.
.@space_tom @NtlSTEMCentre that's exactly what I've been doing today too in Star City...comfy isn't it :)!
@Jane_MacArthur it was a pleasure to join in from SC  enjoy the rest of #nam2014
Looking forward to Skype calling #nam2014 tonight from Star City  Russia. Currently studying Soyuz spacecraft @portsmouthuni @RoyalAstroSoc
@camurriusa @astro_luca @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas did I miss something...?
@Thom_astro you'll need all the help you can get to regen your atmosphere ;)
@Tim_JR_Hill @traceyfs #ISS is actually at 1 atmosphere pressure!
.@AstroSamantha @Astro_Alex @astro_luca @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas 5 years already...who'll be next to lose all their hair :) #Shenanigans09
.@KayDesigner Weights! Pressurised suit is so buoyant it takes a lot of weight to be neutral. Multiple pockets helps get perfect 'weigh-out'
@space_tom I'm sure we can arrange something!!
@LiNa8294 @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas now that Shenanigan shows dedication!
@PC0101 @ericarolfe @LiNa8294 @neil_m14 still need to supply raw ingredients  but for space travel it could prove to be much more efficient
@Rocket_Woman1 Ah yes  the skin-tight spacesuit. They've developed a new version just for @Astro_Andreas ... ;) http://t.co/k6cN4x4cpC
@_Insomnious_ please send request to http://t.co/g7ZLsV2S0i - many thanks for the support!
.@Thom_astro @esa Congratulations Thomas and go #shenanigans! It's a busy  exciting time for European human spaceflight.
@AnsonPrimary @sciencemuseum Thanks so much for the inspired ideas - it was great to chat!
@Space_Lectures @Astro_Clay @Astro_Flow @Astro_Nicole What an oversight...rectified!
Fantastic! "@venturethinking: The winning designs @dallascampbell @c_pixi @spacegovuk @desolatemoon http://t.co/oL4Eyl3J9z”
@LiNa8294 quiet here without @Astro_Andreas &amp; @Thom_astro but at least I don't have to watch my back every 5 mins for #Shenanigans :)
.@dallascampbell Russian cosmonauts use Orlan for all their EVAs. Some astronauts have also used it. I've worn both in the pool...so far ;)
Interesting to compare Shuttle &amp; Buran side by side "@Romain_CHARLES: Here are the 2 shuttle models at @ESA_EAC http://t.co/kJQ4oIQWWV”
Don't push that button!! Together in the Soyuz @Astro_Andreas &amp; @Thom_astro constitute a fire hazard ;) http://t.co/Y1O3LGoXl8
Spare a thought for @Astro_Andreas in the cold tonight...or maybe just enjoy pudding instead :) @Thom_astro http://t.co/Eta4AjHdEn
.@TinaThudBump @Astro_Andreas @Thom_astro I'm afraid the only reason is their puerile  infantile sense of humour #shenanigans09
So nice to arrive late in Russia to find your floor covered in cups of water! @Astro_Andreas @Thom_astro 😁 http://t.co/Y1eKDGkmoT
@Keaton_S looking forward to it - great show again this year @BBCStargazing
Thanks to @BBCStargazing Egham &amp; @dallascampbell (now my backup for 2015;) for the great questions tonight
Really enjoyed the Skype with @BBCStargazing earlier today - great questions from the guys in Norwich - many thanks!
.@rjmlaird you mean our extremely rare and much sought after ESA class patch #shenanigans09 ;) Mission patch to follow soon in New Year
.@TinaThudBump not me that's organised but the #ISS programme! Still launch Nov 2015 but some food &amp; clothing items have long lead times
.@PeoplesAstro busy  fun &amp; exciting! No 2 days the same-today simulated rendezvous with HTV cargo vehicle http://t.co/mrQ93fvuLx
@spacegovuk Congratulations @matthewcro @lotaz ...and I'm relieved to hear the winner was not @Thom_astro with his answer of 2017!
@ESAstro_trainer @Astro_Andreas there is nothing funny about the gazebo...the physical scars have healed but the mental trauma remains ;)
@Thom_astro @NASA_SEATEST @ReefBase this was the command post inside Aquarius last year...enjoy all the gadgets :) http://t.co/MMhFPwWfsG
.@simon_rp84 humidity is removed (condensed) &amp; also becomes potable water...so basically we drink processed urine &amp; sweat on #ISS
.@Thom_astro @cake_or_die @Astro_Andreas mildly concerned...what did I leave hanging around the office in Germany?😁
.@albiondumsday pedantically Bigelow is expandable  not inflatable but yeah-got it :)
Spare a thought for @Thom_astro &amp; @Astro_Andreas today-6 hour EVA eval  good luck guys http://t.co/BK37ye6eUG
@spacekate Great to watch @astro_luca at work-very envious;) Makes me realise how good our training is-looks just how it is in the pool
.@astro_luca @gbc123 not surprised-only 15C in Glasgow today;) Will be there in 2 weeks for UKSA conference-take a photo if skies clear:)
@SpaceUpParis @spacekate I promise I will be Tweeting every step of the way! :)
@SpaceKate @spaceapps great idea guys - good luck with this! #teeminus10
.@Victrix75 @spacemascotuk @cmdr_hadfield Of course! CASSiE helped the whole shift &amp; met all Exp35 crew. Robonaut didn't say much though...
.@Ian_Benecken it's always a fun shift when there is a lot going on in the Columbus laboratory
.@SpaceGirlWendy @barryfawbear night dive def a highlight-over 2 hours watching barracuda  tarpon &amp; even nurse sharks-huge buzz after that!!
.@simon_rp84 @esastro_trainer todays training was CPR  translation  disorientation  cargo handling &amp; more. Even had time for some fun :)
.@Astro_Clay I was amazed-he spent 31 parabolas with his head in a box and felt fine at the end of it...he's ready for that Soyuz re-entry!
.@Victrix75 @spacemascotuk still waiting for CASSiE to arrive in Bordeaux  let's not get alarmed  keep calm...any news of MiniMe?
Many thanks @BIS_Spaceflight for hosting a great night &amp; an honour to now be a fellow. Next stop Manchester  Salford &amp; Sheffield #missionxuk
In London-glorious sunshine &amp; a great week planned in UK:@BIS_spaceflight #missionxuk #SASTimPeake @AeroSociety @SpaceMascotuk &amp; more
@amikokauderer sorry Amiko-can't agree with you on that one...having spent 3 years with @USArmy finest 1st Cav Div have to say "Go Army"!
Fun day of training “@ESAstro_trainer: ESA EVA Proficiency Training for @astro_timpeake &amp; @Thom_astro Great job guys! http://t.co/TymOz6rH”
@PeoplesAstro so hard not to sound smug...between NBL &amp; Apaches cant think of better training for ops. Tks again for great article in @sen
@SpaceKate another smooth ride into orbit...looking forward to working with the crew as EUROCOM over the next few months!

@astrotomato When I get there I'll let you know :)
@astrotomato Not been there myself yet-but those who have talk about layers of dead skin that do not get removed and peel off on return-nice
@monkeydogify @astrotomato 62.1371 miles!!
@astrotomato Ha - no comment!
@shanemuk I'm not an advocate of the one-way Mars mission...think we can (&amp; should) do better than that. Nice lyrics though :)
When will we send humans to Mars? @DrAlexKumar gives an insight into some of the challenges http://t.co/W7LRZQLM
@KeithMansfield sorry Keith...simply having too much fun! :)
@rjmlaird many thanks for the good wishes...it's great to be living underwater!
@kulfispace thanks Tahir - you won't be disappointed...the diving here is fantastic!
@rjmlaird interesting-more research required I'd say.My experience emerging after a week in a cave was sense of smell went into overdrive!
@rjmlaird some astronauts have experienced reduced sense of taste not heard of total loss though.Smell important for smoke detection though!
@spacebooster see you there Nick!
@SpaceKate you can follow NEEMO mission here http://t.co/66m7cR8V &amp; 11-22 Jun cameras livestreaming to web from habitat. Apply to NASA!

@roach @tweetsoutloud @neiltyson I did some highly off-nadir shots of it.  Slant range ~1000 miles. You could make out the palm no problem.
@roach @tweetsoutloud @neiltyson for example  a volcano on the horizon?  Yes. Absolutely.

@SHasani61 Easy!  North America  South America  Australia  Asia  Europe  Africa.  I couldn't quite see Antarctica.
@GNageshRao @MadeInSpace I have said many times - this is absolutely the key to humans going far into the solar system. #RPIasksReid
@Schnorbitz5000 absolutely we can  and usually do see it. I watched @OrbitalATK #Cygnus completely reenter.  #Amazing show. #RPIasksReid

@joannekarma of course!
@dbstar25 @AstroTerry  @MightyFine89 - it is always up to the flight docs  generally they want us to wait ~45 days after returning.
@DeepDish_ @Rainmaker1973 @StationCDRKelly the sun angle has lots to do with the blues. This was perfectly/luckily timed. Incredible
@Ayers111 cool thought. Hope he thought it was possible...but probably didn't think his comparison of three images would be the catalyst.
Between @NASANewHorizons #PlutoFlyby @NASA_Dawn #Ceres &amp; @StationCDRKelly #YearInSpace I'm on solar system exploration overload.

@Pillownaut excellent. My daughter has an ocelot addiction so she will love this!!
@PC0101 @GregRawson @NASA I wouldn't call it 'trolling' :)
@icelady2910 @Astro_Alex @Msuraev yeah- Max had a GoPro on his ventilator. Love those views!!
@roach definitely let us know when that goes live. In the meantime I guess I'll be watching @tracedominguez #fridgeview on #Periscope
@PC0101 @BlueEnigma @AstroTerry one of the watches is an actiwatch. Monitors activity- not sure what else but @ISS_Research knows!
@PierAsselin this particular photo was a 3 second exposure. I had the camera mounted on a bogen arm. Stars are a touch blurred because of it
@PierAsselin Oh  you can argue with me. It is healthy and welcome discussion! Details of photo+camera settings here: https://t.co/fFWB5QD7JQ
@icelady2910 @Astro_Alex depends what you mean by 'harder.' Landing is physically more demanding in my opinion. Launch is harder emotionally
@deokon @smartereveryday @StationCDRKelly very benign. Just a tiny push from the engine gently settling you back in your seat.
@smartereveryday @StationCDRKelly correct! Their first three burns are complete. Burn 4 (2nd booster 'cleanup' burn) is 37 minutes away.
@davesaad Don't worry Dave  I learned a lot about docking a Soyuz working with @smartereveryday and I had just lived through the real thing!
@MysteryAlice @smartereveryday it takes us about 6 hours from launch to docking.
@hey_ysoserious @smartereveryday the big thing this year will be @StationCDRKelly in space and comparing data to his twin @ShuttleCDRKelly
@theowl84 @smartereveryday an early off-axis burn tilts our orbit a tiny bit so we don't hit ISS if things break. Gets removed on final burn
@roach @apod @Astro_Ron yes! @astro_Pettit also made a beautiful timelapse video I just saw @sxsw
@roach @Astro_Ron SMITHERS!
@roach @Astro_Ron email sent!
@ShuttleAlmanac it is amazing. You don't come 'back to reality' for a solid hour after that ride home!!
@luiz_otavio @PC0101 just make sure you know from which direction it will become visible. Should look like a bright airliner
.@weasdown HAHA! #Earth of course.  Well  that and Saturn.  I love Saturn.
.@AndreaButera #Earth is a perfect canvas. This one of @AstroSamantha's #Italy is probably my #favorite. http://t.co/gRozIIcePP
.@VealSlab as a pilot  I would have loved to fly on the shuttle. But riding a #Soyuz and living in Russia for training was priceless.
.@AahLiLi even in space  there are occasionally bad days. They can be cured by the #Cupola. In the end  it was better than expected.
.@AbsolutSpaceGuy They will enable @Commercial_Crew vehicles to dock without using the robotic arm.

@Belloni_Ale @DNews gravity felt far too powerful my first few days back on Earth.  After a month him though it is just like old times.
@ageekmom concur - but then again you'd be heading to MARS and that would be motivation enough...
@Sannsibble @DNews @tracedominguez @astroengine @astVintageSpace Never felt it  oddly enough
@Zzay @tracedominguez noise is greatly reduced  but still there.  Like a nice background white noise.
@_KristinaluvsU @DNews @tracedominguez @astroengine @astVintageSpace those stories are better shared in person and not recorded online!
@RaHorakhty @NASA @DNews I believe because we are completely isolated.  No one to bring germs in...
@RaHorakhty @NASA @DNews nope!  It was wonderful not to worry about common colds

@BoingBoing @ISS_Research @Space_Station I'm so jealous! Good luck @MadeInSpace - hopefully I'll use it next time I visit #space
@PC0101 @Mise_1 @grniz2 @eugeniafessia @rocketman528 another favorite - you're doing great work Peter.
@PC0101 @eugeniafessia @rocketman528 @sweetgazer1 I loved how you could see the old river path so I snapped the photo.
@sachi_bbsr @PC0101 I'm still in the "very happy to be home" phase  and so amazed I just lived up there for 165 days.
@PC0101 @paulcomp @Space_Station peter  you are a vault of space knowledge!  In my case though  I was tweeting pics  not names.
@fka_roscosmos @ShuttleAlmanac weird to see my friends up there while I'm sitting on my couch down here!
@MSGPA any time you feel tense or trapped  just gotta relax and breathe.
Spent the afternoon disassembling the successful @DLR_en Capillary Channel Flow experiment. http://t.co/NICqz2WRuJ
I LOVE this! Map of our tweets: http://t.co/55QdLVicN7 @astro_alex @msuraev @OlegMKS – thx @DaveAtCOGS http://t.co/PKrkCWYrSf
@Olivia_Dsouza It happens…I attached the wrong photo to this tweet.  Sent a new tweet with corrected photo soon after.
@I_We_Gaia I like the solidarity!  I just took my warm wet towel “bath” after a morning workout on the bike.
Thanks @photogbrian and @astro_wheels for showing me another amazing #SpotTheStation photo from Austin  TX. http://t.co/cmutRUMcKu
I love #science - @tweetsoutloud just emailed me on the #ISS this photo of the @NASA @MarsCuriosity rover. http://t.co/hCJwItw0gK
@PC0101 Thanks for the info! Wasn't sure if I was still over Chile or north of it. Good to know.
@Olivia_Dsouza @sachi_bbsr @PC0101 @DaveAtCOGS Thanks.  Oddly  the only place you marked that I haven’t been is the international airport.
I couldn’t say no to a #selfie with @AstroRobonaut http://t.co/FPqqmTqqtC
Cool shot by @astro_alex of me installing an @DLR_en @ISS_research capillary flow payload. http://t.co/MytExMu16z
Some smart @NASA @vr_doug engineers turned a simple laptop into a great 3D virtual #spacewalk trainer. http://t.co/LLkGdcBdpc
@sachi_bbsr This photo was taken about an hour before I tweeted it. I still think those white lights are boats but can’t verify.
@SethGreen @NASA @TheRealBuzz @tweetsoutloud Have fun guys!  Wish I could join in on the fun.
@psutympany sure is  both legs  even symmetry.
A little on-orbit brain surgery. #Exp40 commander Dr. Swanson removes the head of @AstroRobonaut http://t.co/y45CDWRoJk
@spasmunkey  - good guess  but something tells me you are a little too close for a guess ;)
Great talking with @jeffreykluger @TIME. MT: Watch @TIME's exclusive video chat with @NASA's ISS http://t.co/dJy999SfGn
@Olivia_Dsouza Huge thanks  anyone have a photo of it from ground view?
@Astronomika_ @DanSpace77  excellent!!!  Thanks for the info.  Very neat from up here.
@jayjum I think that is why. My feet don't impact the ground except for the treadmill.
@akanel My stomach feels full all the time  but floating is AMAZING!
@ShuttleAlmanac I forgot to add 'MT.'  I highly modified the original tweet. Apologies.
@Ian_Benecken @Astro_Alex in one giant gulp called a slam shift.
@Carbon_Flight @jnmatthew well played Ed!!! ;)
@ShuttleAlmanac done!
@AstroSamantha @cosmos4u @ingallsimages @Astro_Cady @Cmnt8r never let the truth get in the way of a good story! Oh well  still gr8 photo! ;)
Houston will intentionally increase drag on the ISS to help phasing for our rendezvous on May 29th. Amazing!  @Astro_Alex @Carbon_Flight
@PeterKingCBS Thanks for the good fun!  Talk to you again soon.
@Astro_Clay @Astro_Alex how did you know!!!???
@Ian_Benecken @Astro_ried thanks for the info. Sad.
@Ian_Benecken @Astro_Alex can we just settle for a tweet ASAP after we get back inside?
@CSSEditor @bnjacobs @AstroSamantha those keys open my apartment. But there is a key to enable the Soyuz launch  not in the vehicle though
@Astro_Wheels @Carbon_Flight a light day in the RFCR?
@Ian_Benecken @AstroSamantha @Astro_Alex he's taking a little break.  Plus  his brain is like a computer ;)
@Carbon_Flight @Astro_Alex @fka_roscosmos I say the higher the better!!
@LaneLuckie I'm told it is due to atomic oxygen in space which hits the thermal cover and causes discoloration.
@sharonbrunton looks like something @Cmdr_Hadfield would certainly have found!
@csf_spaceflight @amikokauderer @CommanderMLA @NASA_Johnson thanks for the photo...I remember that day well!!
@Space_Lectures Ken Ham
@tweetsoutloud @skydart I think maybe an autocorrect error worked in your favor buddy. The j apparently became an h.
@simon_rp84 @Astro_Alex it is.....or was.
@joannekarma @Astro_Alex it is going great and we are enjoying the entertainment.
@grb090423 certainly. Good luck. Or in Russia- ни пуха ни пера.
@grb090423 well  lunch is certainly part of the plan :)
@darenwelsh @Astro_Alex @SpaceCenterHou interesting question. By hand or by machine?
@AeroSpaceKnight @ESA_EAC couldn't nap or sleep. That was actually quite hard to prevent!
Spent 6 hours in a recliner for metabolic rate baseline testing @ESA_EAC today. Can't beat forced relaxation! http://t.co/3BFwkhH3sl
@LAismylady @chicklets_1999 @ESA_EAC @esa gets pretty warm and tastes fantastic. Seriously!
@chicklets_1999 @ESA_EAC @esa this is the same food I'll eat in space. I just needed to warm it up by dunking it in hot water.
'Cooking' up a delicious lunch of salmon and vegetables @ESA_EAC for the @esa ENERGY experiment. http://t.co/p3f8SstnqC
@tweetsoutloud @Astro_Alex I have room for one more if you have the $$!
@Ian_Benecken  @Astro_Alex - no changes. I was simply looking at Steve's procedures so I had a better idea of his challenges working w/arm.
@joannekarma I though the same thing...
@joannekarma @Astro_Alex @esaoperations all of that training was for real.  We have never staged a photo/video...
@muellerspace @tweetsoutloud @Astro_Alex yes  myself  Alex  and Oleg are all rookies...
@tweetsoutloud @Astro_Alex excited and yet oddly  extremely relaxed.  More so than at any other point in my life.
@Brigitte_Ba @Astro_Alex I'll ask her!
@tweetsoutloud @Carbon_Flight @NASA I'm certainly up for the challenge!!
@spacechelle @Astro_Alex actually  they bought me a countdown clock for Christmas. No joke! ;)
@SpaceKSCBlog I think I'll pass on that one!
@Pillownaut @Astro_Alex thanks Heather!
@vr_doug @Astro_Alex @esa @NASA great expression!  Thanks for the photo
@vr_doug @NASA_Johnson @Astro_Alex cool pic!!
@JeriLRyan - I looked all over Star City today. Sadly no bubble wrap ;) @Astro_Kate7 @astro_kjell @AstroIronMike @Astro_Cady @spasmunkey
@Ian_Benecken same!
@Ian_Benecken @Astro_Alex I would say the names are TBD at this point.
@Thom_astro @Astro_Alex if we are in manual reentry and I'm flying  there will be no need to pump.  Just verbal encouragement will suffice.
@Ian_Benecken @Astro_Alex I don't believe that to be true. We will know for sure when we are both outside #ISS in spacesuits
@Carbon_Flight @Astro_Alex it's a beauty!
Eating dinner in Star City with 5 of the 6 2009 @ESA_EAC astronauts. Only missing our buddy @astro_luca - #shenanigans
@ShuttleAlmanac well done!  It is all white here now but you're spot on!
@ShuttleAlmanac despite the cold  Russian ice cream is still delicious though!!
@tweetsoutloud @stevenroy27 @chevrolet deal!
@tweetsoutloud @stevenroy27 @chevrolet you landed a car on Mars. I trust ya.
@tweetsoutloud @chevrolet I wish...but I would gladly pay to fund that technology. Amazing.
@tweetsoutloud did you see the 2015 Z06 corvette?  I might be selling my family truckster and bringing back the tradition. Wow.
@Thom_astro @Astro_Alex I see some #shenanigans in our future!
@NERDHERDGUY4824 @Astro_Clay Princess Bride followed by Shawshank. Passed the time perfectly.
@Astro_Clay @NERDHERDGUY4824 there have been requests for princess bride and I have Shawshank on standby.
@Astro_yyz I'll knock out a movie or two and then spend the rest of the time doing evaluations of the suit.  Reach  fit  feel  etc.
@eugeniafessia unfortunately  no. But I have trained with him off and on for the last 4 years. A brilliant mind.
@DaveAtCOGS wow...that is great!!!! Will you do this for E40/41 too?
@sharonbrunton not too bad during...much worse after!
@spacechelle @msengupta @Astro_Maker @Astro_Kate7 yup Maker  she's lost it!  I'm ready to SING!!  Break out the dress whites....
@sharonbrunton very interesting!  Thanks for the photo
@spasmunkey 37 years of practicing. I think I'll be good!
@acebrodie @lewisjcampbell @spacechelle @RealMacKaySTV absolutely fantastic.  I think the frog looks quite happy...
@spacechelle nope  it is my friends that are the main contributor!! ;)
@andresdavid I think it is fun!!
@SolX2010 @Stratocumulus  if you are talking to @astro_mike you have the best advice around. Glad to hear all is going well!
@Astro_Alex @Carbon_Flight @ESA_EAC  Celebrated with my parents  Carroll and the kids. Only missing you and Max!
@bigunderscorec EVA assistant is the end goal. For now it is used by crew  and the hope is to have ground operators controlling.
@Earther57 @libbydoodle @jtowns @ageekmom Penny  I love it!  Just saw the article too. Nicely done!!
@spasmunkey @Carbon_Flight hey!
@sharonbrunton a huge difference!
@omaflinger @ProteinWrangler @sidbyrd @travelholic greetings from Tsukuba  Japan!  Sorry I'll miss Frenchies. Great food!!
@ShuttleAlmanac I just sent it to public affairs.  Should be up soon!
@ApolloSoyuzSara @Astro_Alex I can confirm my inability to wait. Let's go!
When @Carbon_Flight speaks  @Astro_Alex and I listen. Expedition 41 design just approved! #worththewait? http://t.co/EheZuAfyAb
@sharonbrunton you're right on family...they have fist rights to launch but if there are openings I'll let you know Sharon!
. @Astro_Alex moving 750lbs (340kg) with ease in the virtual reality trainer @NASA_Johnson @vr_doug http://t.co/i7TiBICt11
@sharonbrunton we get to invite 15 people and they have to pay their way. Extremely expensive!
@sharonbrunton the next year should be a blast!
@cosmos4u wow...AMAZING!  Absolutely amazing.  Thanks!
@kmccoy beautiful picture...perfectly framed!  Thanks!
@SpaceKate trust me...I'm cherishing every moment  knowing how lucky I am  and wishing everyone could join in this adventure.
@jayjum ok...ok. You make a good point.
@Carbon_Flight @astro_alex @camilla_sdo concur. This bird better start pulling her weight (which isn't much!!)
@spasmunkey @astro_alex @carbon_flight you better believe I've been there. First visit wasn't until '09 though.
@sharonbrunton no EVA currently scheduled...but the schedule always changes
@radiobartlett I only have degrees in computer and systems engineering.  I'll just cross my fingers with each flush...
@Carbon_Flight @astro_alex I'll bring my tactical sword to work from now on!
@Astro_Clay @romeoch @astro_alex "we" are anything but normal because we know you  Clay!
@rocketman528 EAC for a week and then home sweet home.
FYI @MondoBasso @cbsbaltimore - it is officially Super Bowl Weekend in Russia! Preparing to paint the town #PURPLE with @astroterry #Ravens
@Pillownaut that is hilarious!
@jnmatthew @carbon_flight #blushing
@Carbon_Flight @camilla_sdo @astro_alex we have ways of finding out what u r doing flight!  But only for 5 more minutes.
@sharonbrunton we do winter survival in case we land off target and need to wait a day or two for pickup. Plus it is good general knowledge.
@Camilla_SDO @nasa_johnson @astro_clay no one has moves like Clay!!
@sharonbrunton I was at zero g for a bit today as a matter of fact!  It was fantastic.
@sharonbrunton thankfully it will be weightless... It is designed for use with the gloves so all the settings are glove-friendly.
@sharonbrunton yes  very heavy.  The real suit is about 300 pounds but this version is a bit less. Nearly impossible to walk in it.
It is a great day when the legendary @tweetsoutloud has joined the adventure.  Great meeting you Friday! #mohawktime http://t.co/8ByTQ043
@Camilla_SDO @carbon_flight @astro_alex Camilla- can you explain why I found twigs and debris in the Soyuz yesterday?  R U nesting?
Watching Russia take on Portugal in 'football' then the #orioles start at 1am.  Great night! @sharonbrunton - Pulling 4 Ireland 4u!
@thenasaman @h_p_r_u @astron8 I can confirm receipt by his mom since his mom just emailed the photo to him during our lunch in Чкаловский.
@spacechelle I'd say the last rendezvous was better than this one.  I always like unexpected outcomes  especially if it involves Hams...
@sharonbrunton some people talk of a 'falling' sensation.  I'll let you know in a year and a half...
@Pillownaut I love these stats!  Nice work!!
@sharonbrunton you know too much!  Yeah  it was a great day of flying.
@romeoch love the Russian suit!
@Pillownaut @chrisastro @woodtoast @camilla_sdo we have just under 2 years to make this happen. So I'm sayin' there's a chance!
@Carbon_Flight @astrosamantha @astro_alex Ed...we're going to take great care of our outpost in space  because we want to be invited back!
@sharonbrunton no NEEMO for me unfortunately...
@eugeniafessia @costantiniwm I couldn't figure out what the car was for  but I want to try it!
@sharonbrunton hi Sharon.  I will do about half in Russia  half in the US. There are hundreds of satellites higher than the ISS.
@CRKARLA Ola!
@sharonbrunton I will do some training in the centrifuge. I did some in the navy as well.  It was always fun...
@sharonbrunton that's an incredible photo. What are the chances of a cloudless sky over such a vast area?
@sharonbrunton thanks Sharon!  Same to you.
@Camilla_SDO @carbon_flight @astro_alex we'd love to have you Camilla...unless you're CHICKEN!
@Camilla_SDO @carbon_flight I'm willing to educate if this would be worth your time  but I'm warning you- there's wild hungry dogs there!
@Camilla_SDO @carbon_flight let me take you to Star City in March and I promise I'll use you to extend my reach in the spacecraft!
@jayjum yeah  not sure.  I honestly think NASA's use of social media played a big role...
Just learned that @Carbon_Flight (Ed Van Cise) will be my lead flight director for Expedition 41 on the #ISS. Fantastic news for our crew!
@spasmunkey @krubins love ya spasmonkey!  I am so confused by this right now!

@emgoyaars Model van de eerste maanlander. Van de Sovjet Unie. Voor de Amerikanen.
@emgoyaars https://t.co/l1udQLqeVJ
@WPSCHAASBERG @AustinOnSocial You also count people "hiding" in the moonlander  cars  houses  caves  etc. #fail
@Vision23 @AustinOnSocial Of course you do. You also include the peole hidden in the moonlander and houses etc.
@emgoyaars Sovjet Unie landde eerder op de maan met onbemande Lunagod. Bracht ook stenen terug. Test van bemande raket mislukte. Gaven op
@emgoyaars Ik kon ook geen/nauwelijks sterren zien als ik aan de felbelichte dagkant naar de aarde keek.
@emgoyaars Als je het negatief overbelicht worden de sterren weer zichtbaar

@vancalmthout @NewsFromSpace Dat was het roet aan de buitenkant vd Soyuz na de vurige 1500-2000gr terugkeer door de atmosfeer.
@Hugefourtytwo Het zal er heel anders uit zien en niet op DNA basis. We zoeken ook naar kunstmatige ellectromagnetische signalen.
@Hugefourtytwo Niks uitsluiten  maar waarschijnlijk H2O en C based. Dat zoeken bij kometen  op Mars  onder ijs op manen Europa/Enceladus
@Hugefourtytwo Definitie leven oa chemische/fysische interactie met omgeving  voortplanting. Zoeken naar "onnatuurlijke" moleculen/signalen
@Hugefourtytwo Leven waarschijnlijk gebaseerd op koolstof. Kan meeste verbindingen maken.
@Hugefourtytwo Op oceaanbodem bij 300 graden nog steeds vloeibaar water en gebasserd op koolstof en familie van ons.
@Hugefourtytwo H2O is overal in heelal. Neutrale vloeistof nodig voor  delicate chemische reacties.
@Hugefourtytwo Astroiden bevatten mogelijk metalen voor electronica industrie. Op Aarde zeldzaam. Vereist mijnbouw in Afrika/Groenland/etc
@Hugefourtytwo Het idee is Helium3 winning als totaal schone brandstof voor potentiele kernfusiereactoren.

@tarynoneill @Scirens What the...? I posted to instagram and push to twitter  so it must've found the nearest match. Weird.
@GeorgeTakei @Uncannygirl ... unless you're an astronomer. #harumph
@jimcvit @mlthaller That's about how Galileo saw it. :)
@alexwitze @nadiamdrake NICE. Congrats!
@jayvise Nice!
@NeverKnitDrunk I love it when that happens. The geometry is fun.
@RyanWVoll Please don’t involve me in conversations with flat earthers.
@sandentotten Knowing I’m doing what I can to Save The World helps.
@shaka_lulu Wow! Nice glory!

@elakdawalla @hubbahubble @Tuplet Andereweltenhaustraurigkeit
@sandentotten It's happened so many times that I think it does prove it.
@sandentotten I'm getting suspicious of you.
My pal @SciGuySpace agrees about Blue Origin  too: We’re seeing the dawn of an industry here. https://t.co/WJH7se6wkr
@sanjaromin Wow. That’s great!
@spaceguy87 Ah. Got it. Thanks!
@shakaplan I eat there every time I'm in town since we filmed Bad Universe. :)
@starstryder @SurlyAmy I really like this one.
@omcintyre @YouGoatMail Ordered it  Dottie? I lived it.
@AmandaSchull You are Elmer J. Fudd. Millionaire. You own a mansion and a yacht.
@LudLer @Pharaoness That’s one of my favorite things to see too. It never gets old.
@antisophista Thanks  but I'm not qualified; I have no experience at all running a planetarium! Also  I'm not looking for a job. :)
@ladygaga4life98 @luanuzumaki06 If an asteroid were coming our astronomers would be yelling it from the rooftops. So  no  were OK.
@ladygaga4life98 No. https://t.co/Gxa2yadAFt
@HiRISE I would never claim that.
@GoodyAwards Wow  thank you!
@RachelFeltman @Cmdr_Hadfield Ha! I just replied to him; I thought the exact same thing.
@hollyamos22 @tweetsoutloud Have you tried swapping out the bio-neural gel pack?
@tweetsoutloud @hollyamos22 @CharterCom But just like a bad ISP you. Keep. Missing. The target download rates.
@dinkspal Coooool
@mikamckinnon Did the Earth move for you? Etc etc
@hollyamos22 @NASA @OSIRISREx That’s another thing to Chekov the list.
@hollyamos22 @NASA @OSIRISREx Zulu  Holly. ZZZZzzzzzz.
@jqmcd @arielwaldman Cool! I wrote a lot of the web stuff back in the day.
@jqmcd @arielwaldman I know. I worked on the education/public outreach for that mission. :)
@HiRISE That is gorgeous.
@BeckePhysics Cool!
@CassC13 I'm still around. My panel with @tweetsoutloud was better anyway. ;)
Agreed. RT @ponder68: Op-ed: We love you SpaceX  and hope you reach Mars. But we need you to focus. https://t.co/Wdb7XnQ7wl @SciGuySpace
@Caissie @tweetsoutloud Cool!

@HiRISE Dang. That's weird. Volcano or crater? Lots of wind there though.
@DanBatcheldor Geez  I forgot those are still on Cafe Press. Nice!
@Miz_Mora @Summer_Ash @startorialist I'll be there this weekend for a Star Trek con.  :)
@Pomerantz @virgingalactic Oh my gosh! That’s a good point. The answer is yes. :)
@tweetsoutloud Thanks Bobak. And see you in a couple of days!
@kejames @MikeDrucker Yup. That was another reason I was happy to be on board. Specifics to come later…
@arielwaldman @MikeDrucker Yup! Thanks. :)
@RachelFeltman :) Thanks!
@MaryEMcGlynn @BabakTafreshi @tweetsoutloud I'll be there the last day of Hawaii con. :)
@MaryEMcGlynn @BabakTafreshi @tweetsoutloud Yeah  almost certainly that’s the culprit.
@MaryEMcGlynn @BabakTafreshi If I see what you mean it may very well be a persistent train: https://t.co/goX30IMizX
@MaryEMcGlynn @blumspew @Eppixadventures @NASA @SPACEdotcom Wow! Was that an Iridium flare?
@TheSpaceGal Oh  once a year or so indulge myself.

@halfastro @merrdiff THAT’S AMAZING. And Im totally using this in a blog post. You don’t get to say no. :)
@omcintyre @exploreplanets @Celestron It was nice to meet you! I hope all the 'scopes raise lots of cash for TPS.

@hubbahubble @ChineseRoom Some of it will be pretty obvious.
@hubbahubble @ChineseRoom Cool! I consulted on that game. :) I hope you like it!
@RonBaalke It's a bird.
@RonBaalke Wow! You’re getting good stuff on that cam.
@FakeAstropix How many times has @JonAustinjourn1 tweeted about the end of the world? He must be batting 0.000. By definition.

@connollyjeff1 I wrote this about it: https://t.co/SVWXpmd4Ne
@starstryder AHA! OK then  thanks. I mean  my friend says thanks.
@starstryder WELL? Are they as good? Asking for a Thin Mint addicted friend who has literally 8 cookies left from Gallifrey 1.
@b0yle @HillaryClinton Thanks for the shout out  Alan. :)
@1995kim No.
@That_MarcC I will  after I eat. I do that every day. It helps a lot.
@NGC3314 @kippteague Yup. I was 6.
@astro_reid @USNavy @nanopore Nice. :)
@RonBaalke Yay?
@mikamckinnon I definitely need to sit down with you and talk tsunamis. Seismic and asteroidal impacty.
My friend @mikamckinnon did a very cool tweet series on landslides  tsunamis  and seiches. Start here: https://t.co/kYsAHVF9AA
@mikamckinnon Oh I think they’re fascinating. Pretty much ever since I stood on the rim of La Palma and looked down.
@mikamckinnon FIVE CUBIC KM. FIVE.   I won’t sleep for a week now. Wow.

@RobinEdgar Sounds like it may have been the Peekskill meteor. Look it up! Amazing story.
@morgfair @The_News_DIVA @ShiCooks @LarsJohanL @Alex_Verbeek @RawStory It's interesting! But I couldn't find any journal papers about it. :/
@DrMRFrancis @NoisyAstronomer And res this: https://t.co/dYvURtT8Sv She’s wrong about Constellation  too.
@AmandaSchull Wow! Way more than Mars in there  too: Saturn  Antares (and nebula around it)  the Rho Ophiuchi nebula… Dang.
@DJSnM The existence of tomatoes and plankton can somehow be used by deniers to “prove” Apollo was faked.
@AmandaSchull @TheEricGoldman You Litt him up.
@tweetsoutloud @NASAVoyager @reddit Wow. That impact though. Brrrr.
@MysterMyke Nah. Thanks  though. It’s a ways off.
@starstryder @roseveleth @SurlyAmy I’ve received tweets from people who know the area and say it is indeed Baton Rouge.
@roseveleth @SurlyAmy @starstryder Ohhhhh  I didn’t read it that way at all. OK  my mistake; I’ll correct it. Thanks!
@SurlyAmy @starstryder @roseveleth … but I don’t have confirmation either way.
@SurlyAmy @starstryder @roseveleth As I understand it it’s not from Baton Rouge: https://t.co/OtfA8zPxyL
@tiffany_wishon @FakeAstropix No  that page is complete baloney. Too much to even summarize here.
@g_rempel Yikes!
@tamarakrinsky Me too. I hate missing a chance to see so many friends.
@tamarakrinsky I assume you mean me? :) Nope  I’m not going this year. I wish I could!
@tamarakrinsky @Miz_Mora @tarynoneill My pleasure! That was a fun interview.
Be smart: Listen to my friends @tamarakrinsky @miz_mora &amp; @tarynoneill talk science on The Women of Marvel podcast! https://t.co/QmsmK8Zed5
@FakeAstropix It’s not a meteorite until after it hits  so a meteorite can’t hit the Earth. :)
@KidmatEdenBlog Hmmm  yes. I didn’t mean like a ha-ha or bright smile  more of a sad one. But the sentiment of the story is nice.
@TheMathadon Heh. I forgot about that one.
@DaveMosher At least they’d never make that same mistake twice.  &lt;cough cough&gt; #SLS &lt;cough&gt;
@tacticalskyguy Do you understand that Philando Castile did not resist  and was shot anyway?
@rsimmon @NASA_Landsat @NASAEarth Oh  that’s very cool. I’ll read this in the morning. Thanks!
This article by @SciGuySpace about NASA and the current Obama administration is on point. https://t.co/xvKvYcgrmg
6/ But I have a soapbox and can shine a light. I want to know more. So I’m listening to @DNLee5  @DrRubidium  @IBJIYONGI  &amp; @dblackanese.
@RonBaalke @susanbellfilm Nice!
@_southernoracle Good point. :) Thanks!
@morgfair @The_News_DIVA @ShiCooks @LarsJohanL @loretobgude :) https://t.co/gIhlracETw
@ridingrobots @RachelFeltman Ooooh  cool. I've bookmarked that.
@RachelFeltman When people say I send them to this article I wrote about it. Maybe it'll help: https://t.co/iTcbf806hE
@AstroKatie @elakdawalla @sondy I think I just collapsed my wave function.
@elakdawalla @sondy Yeah  &lt;cringe&gt;.
@mikamckinnon Ammonia and methane. Stir rapidly  cool with nearly degenerate metallic hydrogen.
@HiRISE It will have yet already happen.
@markmccaughrean @GeertHub @elakdawalla I was on HST for years &amp; know/agree with proprietary period. Different for space missions.
@elakdawalla @markmccaughrean Rovers as well.
Some folks live-tweeting #Juno events: @Summer_ash @elakdawalla @jeff_foust @mlthaller @mikamckinnon More: https://t.co/u0bK5woYyF
@Pharaoness :)
My pal @pharaoness has more links about #Juno on G+: https://t.co/bu1wrVBXaP
@mikamckinnon Yeah  I’d love to do one of those someday. Bad timing combined with having to fly in and all that.
@mikamckinnon @EricDexLa I might be a *tad* jealous. Just a  tad.
@mikamckinnon Welllllll… https://t.co/sVkNh2BCV4
@jqmcd Good point. They run into their house when storms come  so I expect they’ll do that with fireworks. I plan on checking them a lot.
@scalzi @tweetsoutloud What are dorks  Alex?
@flugennock @kwmurphy @airandspace Thanks for coming! And to the NASM for hosting it. :)
@mikamckinnon @ClarkPlanet Ha. Yeah. They're good people there.
@mikamckinnon @ClarkPlanet Say hi to Seth for me! That's a great planetarium.
@katherinen @TerryMatalas @AaronAStanford @AmandaSchull @EmilyHampshire_ @kirkacevedo :) Have a great night KN!
@TerryMatalas @EmilyHampshire_ @AmandaSchull @AaronAStanford @EW @12MonkeysSyfy @12MonkeysRoom Awwww. Come to Denver!
WOOHOO! Congrats to my friends @TerryMatalas @EmilyHampshire_ @AmandaSchull @AaronAStanford! https://t.co/vJOfQwLCzh
@lizlandau @DrMRFrancis I think it’s different; no small clump near the core. But it does look like optical+X-ray!
@Daisyletgo @airandspace See you there! :)
@RonBaalke @geoffnotkin That sure looks like a meteorite to me. Coooool.
@wilw @SirEviscerate @xeni @AnneWheaton Same here  different wife.
@SpaceGeena Sure! I’l be around there some of the day  though I’m not sure just where and when.
@mggtTaylor OK  comets scoff at *most people’s* gravity.
Just so’s y’all know  @DrNeilTyson isn’t actually Neil Tyson. It’s a parody account. You want @neiltyson.
@mcnees Nice!
@PictureTheSouth @Charlotte_Five I’d expect that to be in Cardiff  not in NC!
@SirDoubtsALot Nope.
My pal @amandaschull is on “Murder in the First” on TNT right now! Watch her in that  then on #12Monkeys on @Syfy tomorrow.
@sequentialkady Wow!
@jtotheizzoe That’s from one of my favorite movies  “Toga! Toga! Toga!”
@WA4LZC Wow  beautiful iridescent cloud!
@MaryEMcGlynn A lot of intolerance oozing to the surface here and elsewhere.
@PeterDEdmonds Thanks for including me!
@71djt Hubble doesn’t use a lens.
Wow. @PeterDEdmonds has a *lot* of astronomy info links for your perusal. https://t.co/NjcAnQGKH2
@sarim0t0 That is patently untrue. Solar use is accelerating in this country and is cheaper than fossil in some places.
A nice interview with @fakeastropix on how to spot a fake photo. Avoid those spammy photo accounts! https://t.co/ezo3yOhnkm
@Miz_Mora @YogaWorks Ah yes  the Spitzer Infrared Orion Stretch. @startorialist
@FakeAstropix @MENnewsdesk Oh for heaven’s sake.
@PalePrimate I wrote about that: https://t.co/QBYD6k3s75
@wxlada Oh  nice. I’ll read that. And yes  I spent quite a bit of time on this last night (and second guessing myself this morning :).
@wxlada Yup. Quite a mess. Different time zones  crossing date line  etc.
@FakeAstropix @StargazerRob @PicPedant Thanks! But… this is a better link. :) https://t.co/u5wh0bplke
@Astroguyz @b0yle Once every 19 years or so for a given solstice sounds rare to me! Next one on a June solstice won’t be until 2062.
@tianquiztentli @WORLDSTAR Dang. But I have little goats. Not sure how’d they fair here. :)
@nyrath *Some* of the air freezes here. But on Mars it snows out in the winter. Pressure drops by 30% or so.
@TerryMatalas @AmandaSchull Josessie.
@HiRISE This is close: https://t.co/t0iPJYLAwI
@IraThorpe @LIGO Wow  thank you!
@xZise @ArtOfAstronomy @ESA_Rosetta Yup. It’s the asteroid Mathilde.
@TheSpaceGal :)
@AmandaSchull @AaronAStanford @LauraKindred @AGlassOfWine1 Hubba hubbas all around.
@That_MarcC @UAHSWIRLL Oh  nice one!
@RobertGaristo @PhysRevLett It’s linked in the article I wrote.
@LadyBusiness_ @FeralCrone Yes  it is.   Via @startorialist https://t.co/Qfs7Jo89z2 https://t.co/kC6NKgc9XD
@AmandaSchull &lt;3
@DJSnM @arstechnica Given that my iPhone automatically destroys all my photos by smoothing  yes  this would be nice.
@MrKulick @fcain @starstryder Wonderful! I can safely say we're all glad to help. :)
@AmandaSchull @TerryMatalas @EmilyHampshire_ @12MonkeysSyfy I'm sure I can squeeze that into my schedule.
@AmandaSchull @EmilyHampshire_ @12MonkeysSyfy &lt;jealous&gt;
@TerryMatalas @EmilyHampshire_ @AmandaSchull @12MonkeysSyfy Oh dang! I've never used it. Someday...
@EmilyHampshire_ @AmandaSchull @12MonkeysSyfy Oh  that scene. Love that old Hooker telescope. Surprised they let you throw leaves in there!
@uberchef @AmandaSchull @EmilyHampshire_ @TerryMatalas +1
Time is unraveling. #12Monkeys @AmandaSchull @EmilyHampshire_ @TerryMatalas (&amp; yes  this is from my actual yard) https://t.co/duo4JzfUha
@startorialist Done.
@markmccaughrean Just checked; while I wrote about VE many times  I never did put up images like the ones you linked. I’ll amend the post.
@markmccaughrean Good point! It’s been ten years  and I simply didn’t think about it. Arg! :/
@TheSpaceGal Sometimes. I don't reply  I block. No one gets to tell me what I can and can't say. I'm a human with opinions and a soapbox.
@startorialist Of course. It’ll go up in the morning.
@startorialist Thanks.
@startorialist May I use that solar heart pic in a blog post?
@AmandaSchull &lt;3
@One_Classy_Bum @TheSpaceGal You are responding to a tweet about it being inappropriate for a stranger to tell someone they are sexy.
@JoshMattson No  and I want to. So weird.
@GerardoBarbosa I don't know  but that all looks CGI. I'm not sure if it's actually photos from orbit or not.
@LDMay @ridingrobots I think we were just Marsplained.
@NGC3314 @SpaceGeck I think that’s exactly what it is. I’m going to read the papers next. :) Reminds me of the Red Rectangle.
@Alex_Parker @Wikipedia NIIIIIICE. Alex  how much work did you put into that?
@mlv @Oatmeal The GOP has been responsible for extraordinary and unprecedented levels of obstruction in Congress.
@BeckePhysics Nice! Astronomers shouldn’t even bother printing books. Things chase too quickly. :)
@MysterMyke That’s adorable… but I’m not sure how good it is for a goat to sit that way for long.
@sanjaromin Thanks! :)
@shannonmstirone No need to DM. :) It’s thebadastronomer@gmail.com
@nogoodnickleft Glad you liked it!
@sequentialkady Well  kinda  but I’ll take it.
@TheSpaceGal @Oatmeal @realDonaldTrump :)
@geoffnotkin WE’LL GO JUMPING  LEAPING!
@PeterGleick @CNN Everyone knows General Products has been suppressing information on their scrith lab results.
@geoffnotkin True. Say hi to everybody for me! And please tell Sally and Kim I hope it goes well and everything’s good. :)
@AmandaSchull Amanda Panda banana. @EmilyHampshire_ must be having a field day with this.
@ElbesoenlaLuna @PlanetarioMad @esa_es @MarsCuriosity @MarsRovers Wow  very cool!
@aztec_again Wow  how pretty! I need to see that for myself someday...
@EmilyHampshire_ @AmandaSchull Oh. Duh. Because of her predilection for eating eucalyptus leaves.
@AmandaSchull @EmilyHampshire_ Y’all are MEAN. #WhyNoNicknameForAmandaYet?
@AmandaSchull @GregoryAlanBush @AaronAStanford OMG “casserole”? That’s the ‘ship name? Inevitable  I suppose.
@tweetsoutloud @Lisa831 In Australia I saw lots of signs for Donner kebobs  and they had no idea why I laughed so hard at that name.
@tweetsoutloud DAMMIT! I didn’t even think of that.
@tweetsoutloud FWIW it didn’t accept FERDOWSI either. https://t.co/wvjEAiiFxx
@EmilyHampshire_ Why are you and @amandaschull so happy when @AaronAStanford and @barbara_sukowa are so dour? What did you do  Emily?
@tanyaofmars @AstroAnarchy @SurlyAmy @starstryder @elakdawalla @jmars_gis That is pretty seriously cool.
@SurlyAmy @starstryder @fcain Here’s a VERY hi res map. You’ll have to look for the features… https://t.co/7wJxKVfEQy
@SurlyAmy @starstryder @fcain Wait  no  that’s no good. Still looking…
@SurlyAmy @starstryder @fcain Try here: https://t.co/rAo68falPF
@AmandaSchull Pbbbt. The acting on that show is amazing. Easy enough to say how good you are. :)
@AmandaSchull You were very good. :)
@AmandaSchull Wow. I watched it. That was pretty dang cool.
@AmandaSchull [Hi Amanda!] Yeah  I’ve been saving the last three. Gonna marathon them tonight. Wish me luck.
@AmandaSchull Watched Lullaby again last night  and yeah. Wow. The whole show leads to that one episode.
@HiRISE Oh  that’s a weird one. Looks like it had a melt pool &amp; then later landslides. The floor is so flat!
@elakdawalla @hubbahubble :) That’s why I wrote it!
@DawnC331 @xeni I hear this guy talked to Musk about it. :) https://t.co/Al7lSNSrcl
@DaveMosher Infinite? It would look like a planet with no humans on it.
@brianwolven @Alex_Parker Oh dang. Well done.
@TerryMatalas @AmandaSchull You know  I have some ideas about that. :)
@hubbahubble I feel bad for you  but that was the funniest tweet I've read all day.
@morgfair @The_News_DIVA @ShiCooks @LarsJohanL But many media have been reporting it straight. Control group may’ve been messed up.
@morgfair @The_News_DIVA @ShiCooks @LarsJohanL It’s been getting roundly torn apart on science blogs  and rightly so IMO.
@morgfair @The_News_DIVA @ShiCooks @LarsJohanL Morgan  that cell phone study was almost certainly baloney. https://t.co/lzRIVeaNh1
@jayvise @MargaretOrr Wow! Lovely shot!
@SUGEN24 Cool! Glad to help!
@starstryder Heh. Joe has a degree in astronomy. :)
@fcain Uh oh. Better clear some space on your hard drive.  https://t.co/OX5lMgPRKZ
@starstryder Oh hey  cool! I’ve walked past that many times visiting the aquarium and such in the harbor.
@tweetsoutloud @instagram @Cmdr_Hadfield Yeah  I think Chris has this covered. https://t.co/dq6NqeCFKH
@DJSnM None  happily. I just scanned the titles there  and um. Yeah.
Worried about cell phones causing cancer? Despite breathless news stories  I’m not. Here’s why: https://t.co/Ddp4aiw2cc  by @RachelFeltman
My pal @b0yle has more on the @SpaceX booster landing (w/ video): https://t.co/X1QNYphi0g
@DJSnM @xZise Actually  no  that’s new to me. I’ll have to look this up. By “higher” though I meant from where it was when I tweeted. :)
@Summer_Ash @DrMRFrancis Thanks! :)
@CaseyDreier Thanks Casey!
@AmandaSchull Holy cats! You weren’t kidding about the fight training. Oof.
@DrMRFrancis I just mean in general. Re: See my article today. W/o peer review  anyone can say anything.
@DrMRFrancis Replace “arXiv” with “Facebook” and you’re saying the same thing.
@prezcannady @Rand_Simberg @genejm29 @omcintyre I strongly disagree. This case exemplifies the problems with that.
@lauriecantillo Thanks. :)
@tweetsoutloud I bite everything. I'm a biter.
.@tweetsoutloud White balance sounds like something GOP Senators meet about behind closed doors.
@tweetsoutloud Cool! Too bad you missed the supernova just out of frame.
@starstryder @AmyMainzer @listen2spacepod A) Amy  very very cool. 2) Eric  you made me laugh.
@ProfMike_M @Club_La_Reforma @WorldAndScience Thanks! I try very hard to track down sources  unlike those icky accounts.
@Summer_Ash @startorialist I saw that one. :) Thought you might like that she wore it to give a TED talk on black holes.
@startorialist @Summer_Ash You’ll like this  I’d wager: https://t.co/LHchYh3ajT
@RonBaalke That number makes it sound like a good... enterprise.
@mikamckinnon No  I haven’t gone in a while  and don’t have any plans to go back this year. :/
@mikamckinnon Ah. I see this now. I'll read it.
@mikamckinnon I think I sense an interesting conversation next time we meet. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
@paulkoan @DJSnM There’s this: https://t.co/Ob246iASdX :)
@sequentialkady We do at least two of these getaways every year. :)
@SpaceGeck @FakeAstropix Using Yorkshire as a location  I can’t get the MW to look like that at any time of the year in SkySafari. Hmm.
@meteorbill @FakeAstropix @brianwolven @TheAstroShake @SpaceGeck @sikaheimo @BritAstro That’s *very* cool.
@PlutoKuiper @Fermilab @AdlerPlanet That’s great! Seeing Saturn for the 1st time is always an amazing thing. :)
@DJSnM Ha! The parking lot gives it away. :)
@moredena @TheCrashCourse Oh  *wow*. That was truly wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing! And I hope he gets to Saturn. :)
@FailedProtostar NICE
@JPMajor @Slate Oh  that was fun. Thanks!
@RonBaalke @jayvise I estimate by eye that if it were retrograde it would pass us ~15-20 km/sec faster.
@jayvise @RonBaalke Yes  but also on a very elliptical orbit  so it’s falling in from a long way.
@RonBaalke Whoa  that 2nd one comes screaming in. It’s a big one  too.
@FakeAstropix @TheAstroShake @SpaceGeck @apod Good point. Probably no Ni. Many Perseids are green tho so either other molecule or O from air
@SanMedra @polymetric_ Dslr  5 sec  f4.5  not sure what zoom setting.
@BeckePhysics @PlanetaryKeri :)
@DrLisaNagy I’m lycan it.
@tweetsoutloud YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.  (I’m next to the goats)
@AstroKatie @tweetsoutloud Katie I JUST saw you like four years ago.
@tweetsoutloud We two shall meet again.
@FakeAstropix @TheAstroShake @SpaceGeck @apod You get green from oxygen  but also nickel from the meteoroid itself. :)
@RonBaalke Oh  that’s cool.
@fzammetti @AmyMainzer When they resort to Red Vines we know all is lost.
@3point1four159 Yup. I pop up in pretty much every episode  waving my hands and getting excited about stuff. :)
@cwmagee Oh! I hadn’t heard that. I’ll have to do some - wait for it - digging.
@mikamckinnon Canada is second biggest producer of nickel  due to Sudbury asteroid impact site. Close?
The opening shot of this video is worth the effort by itself. But it also has my friend @AmyMainzer in it!  https://t.co/4ZebKoTM5X
My friends @tweetsoutloud &amp; @rileah have a new science show coming to #ComicConHQ TV!   https://t.co/oA1IwvplyV
@starstryder It may have 12x the caffeine of its American counterpart. I had coffee in Madrid in 1998 and I still have trouble sleeping.
5/5 And I corrected the Tycho post:   https://t.co/0PcCaqZaYs  Thanks to @PeterDEdmonds for pointing out my mistake!
@PeterDEdmonds Oh  I make my share. Usually momentary brain clouds  like that one. :) A 5-part tweet correction follows…
@PeterDEdmonds AAAARRRRRGGGGGGG! You’re right of course. I’ll fix it.
@SOdendahl @LRO_NASA @NASAGoddard Don't I know it. I have a long history with LRO. I was on 2 EPO proposals for it. :)
@starstryder Good.
@AmandaSchull @EmilyHampshire_ It's not like she's on two really good tv shows and has other things to do.
@coreyspowell @RonBaalke @RPappalardo Yeah  it's weird. Like a Little Planet photo.
@AmandaSchull @jakeloskutoff Cooooooool.
@RobertPicardo Kliban is my favorite cartoonist of all time. I have all his books. Between him and Gahan Wilson they molded my humor.
@geoffnotkin Thanks Geoff!
@AmandaSchull You’re doing great  Amanda. Now give us a tour of your kitchen! :) #AskAmanda
My friend @AmandaSchull from #12Monkeys is live on Periscope!  https://t.co/Mva05vcH7f
@tamarakrinsky @CaraSantaMaria @Celestron @tarynoneill Wow  nice ‘scope!
@markmccaughrean Well  dang. Now I want to go and hear you al!
@markmccaughrean @fedcon I love that cons are doing more science panels and talks. It’s a great time to be a scientist/fan. :)
@EmilyHampshire_ @qkuc @AmandaSchull @12MonkeysSyfy I’ve seen them both together and spacetime survived  but my own continuum was shaken.
@AmandaSchull Sure. I suspect I won’t be alone though. :)
@Ksnickers @4steroidboy Actually  yes they do. They appear to switch directions roughly twice per orbit as they round the Sun from our view.
@RonBaalke Nearby Cosmic Colliders 1701? // cc @wilw
@BeckePhysics That’s pretty!
@ThierryLegault @FakeAstropix @Astroguyz @XavierJubier  Video is private. :)

.@I_We_Gaia That's the privilege of sitting on #Soyuz rocket  launch was not very loud at all (as I recall). 2nd stage was bumpy though
Guten Appetit! #AlexTweetup @timmermansr
@akanel @Msuraev @astro_reid I did! Where were you? #AlexTweetup
Keine Sorge  ich hab die Maus dabei! @shuttle_mike
I did! Must have been more popular... ;) @Thom_astro @astro_reid
Looks more like he needs to clean up the Columbus module first! ;) @owen131pat @NASA360
@JustBe74 @Ian_Benecken @JustBe74 #AlexTweetup It will be before that I think. Have a look at it after our launch and send me a pic! :)
@Ian_Benecken That will be a few days before launch. Not sure if you guys will be here yet though.
A fantastic honor for the #Exp40 crew! What happened to the donut boxes though? ;) @Carbon_Flight @Msuraev @astro_reid
@Ian_Benecken Korrekt

Flight  @astro_reid and I will be looking over your shoulders at MCC! #exp39  @Tungsten_Flight
I did! I am sure the fresh scent of the ocean is amongst the ones I will miss the most up there. @joannekarma
No. You would fall over. @sharonbrunton @vr_doug @astro_reid

@angelitakiz no  mai :)
@angelitakiz buon compleanno! Augurio assolutamente "spintaneo" ;)
@frankthequeen @AstroTerry @TheRealBuzz @Buzzs_xtina I've been married to one for 13 years.
@Thom_astro @astro_timpeake @Astro_Alex @Astro_Andreas it's gotta be 'Los Shenanigos'...
@angelitakiz @wireditalia non ancora
@Schhh_silenzio contento lei. Buona vita!
@Schhh_silenzio lei non cerca una conversazione ma una conferma di quello che lei già crede sia 'verità'. Grazie dell'interesse  buona vita!
@Schhh_silenzio un chiarimento: le foto dalla ISS vengono scaricate tutte allo stesso modo  indipendentemente da chi ha scattato la foto.
@Schhh_silenzio https://t.co/ugc6TCpWzR
@Schhh_silenzio https://t.co/swKI8naP9P
@Schhh_silenzio se lei già trovato la sua verità (qualunque essa sia) ed è sordo a qualsiasi spiegazione  perché continua a farmi domande??
@Schhh_silenzio no: le foto su FB sono jpeg per comodità. Il formato originale è scaricabile sul sito Nasa. Con tutti i dati.
@Schhh_silenzio caro silenzio  tutti i metadati sono rintracciabili sul sito della Nasa. Altro che google.
@Schhh_silenzio forse cerca nel posto sbagliato. Sicuramente non è su internet. La verità costa fatica e anni di studi. Quelli seri  però.
@Schhh_silenzio lente da 400mm. O complotto? Caro sig. Silenzio  devo ammettere che lei ha un profilo che non invita al dialogo! :)
@Schhh_silenzio @terraviewru nella mia foto ci sono le nuvole.
@Schhh_silenzio non sono dott. e non è ISS ma varie possibilità 1) docking 2) accensione motori 3) volo parabolico 4) complotto :)
@Schhh_silenzio @Astro_DavidS quindi complotto? :) I cavi si vedono anche nel segmento successivo  si sono spostati in basso.
@Schhh_silenzio @Astro_DavidS  in quella a sinistra c'è un braccio.
@t_aucone @angelitakiz meglio dell'alternativa.
@angelitakiz perché non dovrei confermare? Certo che sì.
@angelitakiz scusa ma non sono sicuro di cosa stiamo parlando.
@angelitakiz ?
@angelitakiz Yes

@angelitakiz l'ho provato  un trimestre  da studente di liceo.
@Tungsten_Flight you got me! I was instructing a new CapCom :)
@SpaceLauren @Astro_Clay it's plenty interesting for an Italian! Gold and Bronze!!!!!
@angelitakiz @Space_Station @NASA_Johnson no
@deepbluedot anytime :)
@Nanakulikane4 @Rainmaker1973 @Space_Station never
@airandspace however  it deployed correctly. Unused  vented fuel then burned through the risers.
@tomenaspda @Rainmaker1973 @Space_Station redocking is always manual.
@angelitakiz neanche 1
@Ian_Benecken nope  co-sitting as Soyuz expert.
@angelitakiz no. Solo radio.
@starsmilla no  la missione era prevista così per il primo lancio della nuova Soyuz-TMA- MS
@Lindyloo1979 :)
@Lindyloo1979 every time :) not with envy but longing.
@angelitakiz ha!
@angelitakiz non ne ho proprio idea... ma spero smontata per analisi e test (molto meglio che in un museo...)

@daylekny @Astro_Clay I disagree: I've answered that question many times!
@angelitakiz si va per tempo  non per distanza. Di norma sono programmi specifici  ma si può anche scegliere.
@t_aucone sabato
@t_aucone no  è una staffetta!

@paganforge @ISS_Research among other things  yes
@angelitakiz @Frabodum al momento  è più il suono di un'elica ad accompagnarmi!

@Ian_Benecken @esaoperations @ESA_EAC @astro_timpeake 1) Great 2) same for me 3) 'have fun!'
@astro_timpeake @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas @Astro_Alex @AstroSamantha yet another self shenanigan for Tim! You  sir  are unsurpassable.
@angelitakiz ha!
@t_aucone il sistema di controllo ha iniziato la frenata automaticamente. Non è la prima volta. Il docking manuale è comunque previsto.
@NASASpaceflight @desolatemoon not exactly. That's for Progress manual docking.
@AstronautAbby @NASA @nasahqphoto @Space_Station @astro_timpeake @astro_tim @fka_roscosmos so do I! :)
@angelitakiz non credo: Twitter era ancora... giovane.
@angelitakiz :)
@angelitakiz purtroppo non potrò. Lo seguirò via web.
@angelitakiz @panorama_it grazie di averla trovata e pubblicata.
@Thom_astro touché.

@Thom_astro look at those guns...
@starsmilla a me? A me!
@aliceaguiar @ESA_History @esa @ESA_Italia @ASI_spazio @ItalianAirForce happy b-day!
@angelitakiz mi sono già arreso :). Però la foto è davvero sgranata!
@angelitakiz spiacente. Non sono io. Non porto mai cappelli  e sono arrivato circa 2' dopo. Ma se ti fa piacere puoi pensare che sia io :)
@angelitakiz carina la foto. Ma non sono io!
@t_aucone non c'è una regola precisa  ma di sicuro l'impatto è diverso.
@gloriagraizzaro @ReefBase @NASA_NEEMO @FIU hanno grande potenziale
@angelitakiz :)
@angelitakiz :)
@Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas which of the 3 kinds of cheese?
@answerpc usually we're referring  to surface temperature.
@angelitakiz :)
@DrSamStrauss we're out!
@chat2u2 both
@SchmoopyWoopy barra- barracuda
@devilman231170 @angelitakiz non sono paragonabili. Due magnifiche esperienze  assolutamente diverse.
@angelitakiz per oggi? Sì. :)
@DrSamStrauss Thanks Doc. It's quite an experience  and I'm loving every second of it.
@DrSamStrauss of course I do! But I haven't been assigned to an ISS expedition. Hence the "?"
@DrSamStrauss ?
@BugnrugGrant not really. We depend on the surface supply.
@ZMelkes My blog is already in english
@Ian_Benecken :)
@Thom_astro yes  it's to make you feel guilty about eating chocolate pudding cake.
@t_aucone chi ha detto che sia successo? :)
@angelitakiz !
@chat2u2 @Rainmaker1973 @nasahqphoto @astro_timpeake @Astro_Andreas yes they did. A bright orange/red flash.
@PC0101 There was no external support in my book.
@angelitakiz no
@Nunziellabiv @t_aucone sì
@t_aucone sì. Di norma  il limite è considerato di 210 giorni.
@LiNa8294 @Thom_astro @TomCruiseSite yup!
@albiondumsday yes they did. The official report should be available.
@Thom_astro @NASA_Astronauts @esa good idea. Wrong glasses :)
@SP3QFE @AstroKarenN but of course at work  in the best of workplaces
@CltOff @angelitakiz sì
@LiNa8294 I sure do!
@t_aucone purtroppo no.
@angelitakiz :D
@angelitakiz :)
@t_aucone no
@angelitakiz :)
@angelitakiz ... il problema è che se ci penso mi vengono in mente le parole...

@angelitakiz magari altrove
@angelitakiz ma dove le trovi? :)
@Rainmaker1973 a proteggere il Payload dietro.
@t_aucone o la mia incontrando voi? ;)

@Astro_Wheels must be partly Italian!
@angelitakiz :)
@Rainmaker1973 sì
@t_aucone sì
@angelitakiz letto tutto :)
@AstronautAbby ...
@Astro_Clay concur 100%. :)
@angelitakiz @CNNindonesia da leggere ad alta voce. :)
@angelitakiz @repubblicait perché siamo anche noi umani - non zanzare.
@angelitakiz ha! Bellissima...
@DCirioni_AVDA @AstroSamantha sì!
@Rainmaker1973 per me  sì. Alla fine del 2016 avremo volato tutti.
@therealdjflux hello there. Did not recognise you without the helmet.
@Thom_astro @cpamoa @lionelferra what?? No SaucISSe? Oh man...
@Rainmaker1973 stesso esperimento - diverso modulo.
@t_aucone è una revisione delle procedure per @AstroSamantha - quindi né pre né post ma... durante
@angelitakiz piuttosto un 'professore associato' ...
@angelitakiz direi di si. Se vai in vacanza...
@angelitakiz però risparmiamo sull'mp3 player
@t_aucone @argotec_it non lo so ancora
@LiNa8294 @Thom_astro you'd be the only one who loves it :)
@dolcestrega09 @Astro_Cats @tenpixels @Space_Station @NASA_Johnson it felt just like on earth :)
@Astro_Cats @tenpixels @Space_Station @NASA_Johnson yup. You saw it.
Great to train with @Thom_astro :). Here we're familiarising with hardware for our next NBL dive. #Shenanigans09 #EVA http://t.co/6b2Mh0mCdl
@LiNa8294 must've missed it...
@angelitakiz @earthskyscience cieli coperti...

@angelitakiz non sono mai stato granché coi videogiochi...
@Astro_Clay surely. Let me know when you're going.
@Astro_Clay no way! Where's my free phone? ;)
@AstronautOmnia @JoyBellart @Cmdr_Hadfield @Thom_astro there's one guitar  a keyboard and smaller stuff...
@angelitakiz totem?
@angelitakiz :) oggi niente problemi.

@angelitakiz :)
@AstronautAbby @NASA_Johnson I can relate...
@angelitakiz :)
@gelidomattino @Astro_Nicole @ObservingSpace in LEO  we're protected by the magnetosphere.
@Thom_astro bon Noël et joyeux 2015!
@t_aucone già fatto :)
@angelitakiz non amo le definizioni. In generale.
@t_aucone @AstroSamantha si...
@BIS_spaceflight i hope so
@angelitakiz ?
@t_aucone @AstroSamantha no  purtroppo
@angelitakiz se necessario  torna a sognare per raddrizzarla.
@t_aucone una copia
@Thom_astro @astro_timpeake @Astro_Alex @Astro_Andreas ha! You got me there...
@bamamapop @cristinafaloci @t_aucone @Radio3scienza @Radio3tweet :)
@angelitakiz :)
@t_aucone @IT2014EU perché ho chiesto io a @fabfazio di scriverla ed è stato incredibilmente cortese a farlo in pochissimo tempo :)
@angelitakiz la risposta è giusta solo per chi la interpreta.
@angelitakiz quello che non ho scritto è che si può scegliere di non rispondere ;)
@Isabellina26 @OoyenSimone @kikkiar @camurriusa @dolcestrega09 @t_aucone :)
@angelitakiz perché mettere limiti al possibile?
@MarilPitt @t_aucone si
@t_aucone @chetempochefa se va tutto bene sarò presente anche fisicamente:$
@Thom_astro @NASA_Johnson hey  if I remember correctly  spinning is prohibited on a T38! #readthe-1 ;)
@angelitakiz divertente
@ployd01 @t_aucone @ESA_CAVES si  confermo  un sistema radio molto particolare.
@gloriagraizzaro grazie a te!
@angelitakiz non lo sapevo neanche io. :)
@CraftLass 'a tale of two cities'? :)
@govi47 Lo spero proprio: 38 anni (appena compiuti) è presto per la pensione!
@angelitakiz e infatti  non ci sono attori in 'italy in a day'
@devilman231170 @DCirioni_AVDA @frazsazsa @LucianaLittizze @fabfazio la risposta ufficiale sarebbe 1.86... al risveglio  almeno :)
@gloriagraizzaro @frazsazsa ma grazie a voi!
@SP3QFE I'll be travelling  unfortunately
@angelitakiz ;)
@AstronautAbby @AirLawInstitute amazing!!
@DCirioni_AVDA cibo diverso  idea simile
@angelitakiz viaggio sempre leggero :)
@gloriagraizzaro @Techetechete :D
@Astro_Zach @AstronautAbby @TEDx ask someone cool to mentor you. ;)
@Melissandre_L @astro_reid nope: still painful. :)

@joannekarma @NASA_Astronauts @esa because the ISS is not filled with water
@angelitakiz @devilman231170 @dorisa968 @dolcestrega09 @TeoBrex buonqualsiasimomento a tutti!
@angelitakiz :) anche se t'ho abbandonata per 1/2 ora?
@angelitakiz :)
@angelitakiz :)
@datachick my daughters already sequestered it :)
@angelitakiz :)
@angelitakiz buonqualsiasimomento ;)
@angelitakiz @IT2014EU certamente. E di una cosa ancora più importante: il sogno.
@angelitakiz oui!
@PC0101 @Cesare582 confermo tutto :)
@Thom_astro @ESA_CAVES @esa or for 'big brother'... to get kicked out :)
@angelitakiz giusto un paio di RT e vado via senza disturbare ;)
@angelitakiz perché no?-
@ESA_CAVES @Astro_Andreas @Thom_astro @Astro_Soichi what makes you think you can handle one? ;)
@camurriusa @Thom_astro @astro_timpeake @AstroSamantha @Astro_Andreas @Astro_Alex too obvious...
@applepiea @TEDxMatera ask esa! I'm always happy to join in the fun :)
@angelitakiz Anni e anni di addestramento...
@Astro_Andreas @esaoperations @Thom_astro wait a second: how did I involved in this?? :)

@Stelygs trust me  I'm looking forward to find the same inspiration ;)
@I_We_Gaia I might  why not? :)
@angelitakiz non lo sapevo neanche io... :)
@MikeTheCoolMan @carlos_storms @Astro_Wheels the atmosphere's the same on board the ISS. So no difference. But I can't blow bubbles.

@brigadam Thank you very much.  glad you enjoyed them.
@stren000 @nytimes work wasn't done before deadline
@iva_987 how nice of me!
@mbaudis @UZH_Science thanks.. see you tomorrow
@interUNFAO @RobRe62 see my newyorker article.
@Crassall me too.
@SelfExamineLife @tigerduck bingo!
@TakeThatHistory don't know.. frankly
@dcastelvecchi  that is classical Gravity acting on quantum states of matter. Different.
@Klekociuk thanks. Not in oz then.
@CMacauley82 @TIFF_NET thank you
@paul_kramarchyk @TIFF_NET yes. Am lucky
@ericschupper will try.
@L0Jim no.. it was study curiosity..  two things he lacks.
@JonPaulSapsford been there. Like it there.
@TheTXFlash it is fascinating to me to read the responses. Very educational.
@TheTXFlash me too
@Christ21cent @myles_barr speak for yourself.
@atime4truth @Sillymidoff49 yup it does.. end of discussion
@atime4truth @CaptainAhabTX @Sillymidoff49 look at the universe
@atime4truth @Sillymidoff49 all fossil evidence supports evolution. Hundreds of predictions verified. None of biology makes sense without it
@TheTXFlash @irony3glink @realDonaldTrump only a set of measure zero in the multiverse.
@TheTXFlash @irony3glink @realDonaldTrump exactly. And it isn't 10 billion. We know that because he says it is. :)
@wgpnta @BakareDlaw hold on to it tight.
@Perdnoot @AtyHans @neiltyson agreed gravitational waves the key.
@wgpnta @BakareDlaw have fun
@KevinOnEarth even then I don't get it. The athletes represent themselves.
@Mariposaland @hackenslash1 just as bad.. :)
@Christ21cent @Mariposaland yeah no joke. More like a nightmare.
@iva_987 @arizonapbs yes.. we had a moment of silence for him or her
@omcintyre @ASUOrigins yes. I believe so.. and a produced version archived for later appearance on the web.
@Christ21cent @Mariposaland rather focus on life
@benjiderooij thanks
@iva_987 yes. At least I could comment on the proposed design.
@iva_987 thanks!  Good to hear. Thanks.
@hugorealtor there will be.
@iva_987 not yet  I guess.. maybe after sept. premiere in Toronto.
@Rahj685A read it and see.. :)
@TamiHoshiyama @Mogleeone @NotChurchy @godlessVG @aigkenham thank you
@ramriot yes
@nealunger @dallascampbell nice piece.. enjoy the book!
@dallascampbell @nealunger Actually  I own it.. as Werner has loved it  and have been reading it.. and quoting from it.
@Exarkun631 @scifri my piece will appear in New Yorker next week.. it was delayed.
@Legaacys @JustSomeDude79 @old_pyjamas gag

@ClayFerguson @Daz555 no
@JAHattaway yes
@Crush_Endo @AdvanceHumanism @NewYorker thanks.
@BishanChakrabor @nytimes the number of gun deaths is Peter not smaller.
@TehFalker @BishanChakrabor @SolarthWoW agree!
@784578GGBATski @RichardDawkins @ASUOrigins @carlzimmer @pickover @bgzimmer @BillKristol thanks.
@wagnerfilm yes  but regardless of that  the statement Paul made of his relationship with him  an mine for that matter is true.
@ClayFerguson @AnnieDanz since the original replicator was probably rna you should stop pontificating.
@TheFaithslayer this isn't panspermia directly.. just an assist.
@AstroAlex73 thank you.
@oubey thanks!
@DavidBflower @MohamedofShaban thanks
@RobertLouisr @TheFaithslayer no one knows what his real views of any of these issues is.
@TamiHoshiyama keep working on that. You will get it eventually.

@Daz555 @couriermail less no federal case would have been made. stern reprimand and warning.. with no requirement to fly back to OZ for case
@PhilMorey1 good point! :)
@SchitCunce yes agree.... but no fine.. just bond.
@Crassall not what the evidence in court suggested.
@michaelaranger @BernieSanders @Pontifex visit a cathedral. And think of the tax dollars stolen.
An old @bigthink video of absurdity of teaching creationism recently resurfaced. Relevant in this election year.  https://t.co/U32JWfJyoZ
@stren000 yes
@godFreeWorld @RJDownard I agree..  was disappointed that they asked him to be a part of it after I agreed.
@LenFisherScienc thanks.
@shaihulud @StarTrek thank you
Lots of fun tonight @ConwayHall. Great crowd and first time I have talked about LIGO and early universe. Thanks @howtoacademy
@michaelaranger a big one.
Off to UK and Norway tomorrow @howtoacademy Mar 2-London  Mar 5  Trondheim Norway--both sold out alas. Back Mar 12  @asu with Johnny Depp.
@Crassall knowledge
@LenFisherScienc @arizonapbs my ebs number is 7
@NoScience4War so  what is the answer?  :)
@ProfMike_M @tiffcervantes @Mariposaland did you read my New Yorker piece on Carson?
@DrMRFrancis @ProfMike_M I won't.. just mentioned big excitement..
@ProfMike_M p.s. just saw @DrMRFrancis original tweet and that might have given it away to me too :) Happily no torrent this time.
@AstroKatie @mcnees absolutely!.. but am impressed by LIGO so far.. so let's hope for the best.
@mcnees agree. But let's all watch it.
@ProfMike_M first heard about this 3 days ago from journalist but waited for firm confirmation and also that news was out. Got that today.
@ProfMike_M yes. agree. After 4 calls from journalists and assurance from responsible journal that was already known figured ok. Maybe not
@ProfMike_M was told by the reputable journal that contacted me that it had already been announced online in several places.
@ProfMike_M actually waited till it had already been announced elsewhere.
@ProfMike_M don't understand. Media will be at press conference.
@ProfMike_M @DrMRFrancis wow.. don't you think it is worth letting people know there will be a press conference?
@ProfMike_M it produced articles about grav. waves and prepared reporters who have called to express thanks.. not worth discussing anymore
@iva_987 don't know.. may premiere at Cannes.. can't wait to find out.
@iva_987 just saw this.  :)
@wotanhus @ProfMike_M yes
@croftandi nothing
@dcastelvecchi @WIREDScience thanks.
@Crassall thanks.
@ProfMike_M last time I mentioned possibility what it did was produce articles about gravitational waves  which was what I hoped for.
@ProfMike_M I don't think there is much glory in alerting people to the possibility. Don't worry. If true they will deservedly get glory.
@ProfMike_M @alliomack @Crassall @kizolk I think alerting public to the possible discovery they should watch for and be excited about is ok
@ProfMike_M @kizolk they'll get the credit  don't worry.
@ATHE1STP0WER @aabel718 @vsaluki @GlenSteen @GodlessUtopia we measure their gravitational effects.
@VergaraLautaro ushuaia.. argentina
@thebanite thanks.
@stren000 @WarmZeke not good to come out during presidential election.
@iva_987 it's hard for me too!
@iva_987 @wickedsweetcake congrats!  :)
@iva_987 will check with my assistant.
@iva_987 ?
@iva_987 yes.. but I live in the US and also have US citizenship
@WilliamAltoft @BillNye @Ehmee @neiltyson @guardianscience nicely done.
@JackManhire @nature @NatureNews nothing new to report
@iva_987 thanks.
@hula_clay great!
@iva_987 enjoy!
@iva_987 thx.
@lyndalovon @NewYorker read the piece.
@MPCmonkey @RichardDawkins thanks
@danfalk thanks Dan
@NathanaelStCyr @Colossis2 @magguu_ yes  it is difficult  but that is why they are judges  and shouldn't be elected.  :)

@jared_grierson @bigthink I have
@LenFisherScienc @QandA good points.
@michaelaranger try my last book
@Spyder_Webb one requires an extra unwarranted assumption

@sachi_bbsr Perhaps not at this moment (just about over Africa right now)  but we were at 7:39 GMT this morning when I took this picture!
@cosmos4u I mean the Milky Way!  Haven't seen it yet on this mission. But remember it being so striking!
@Ian_Benecken Yes  we are watching. Mission Control Houston is up-linking it live.
@I_We_Gaia He figured it out - I took the pictures. I did tell him how to end the stitches though. =)
My pleasure! MT @NASAJSCStudents We wanted to thank @AstroKarenN for taking time out her day to talk to us last week! http://t.co/JZOLl8xzQp

@Astro_Clay yes I took the photo 2 years ago or so.
@mikamckinnon Field work on the lava flows in Hawaii. Sea kayaking in Orcas Islands.
@mikamckinnon Wow some great pics that bring back lots of memories.
@Astro_Clay Cool shot! https://t.co/Cpbe11acyZ
@mikamckinnon Wow you worked on Stargate! I'm a huge fan. NBL runs just below surface of water were like looking at event horizon.
@andreaatnpj @Nature_NPJ message me on Monday
@andreaatnpj @Nature_NPJ I will be at the ISS conference next week in SD. So if that is what #ISSRDC is then sure.
@502SpaceXfan #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts No privacy. Very little room in capsule and hab module. Like 3 folks in small car.
@adcunningham #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts It jolts you forward since go from high G's to zero G's in milliseconds
@lsullivan @Space_Station #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Probably the 6 hours done by several crews.
@JulieHarden @elsie_see @Space_Station @NASA_Astronauts Not much. It has cargo but enough to remove suit.
@adcunningham #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts The ride home is like being a shoe in a dryer. it is wild.
@adcunningham #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts I was lucky and was at ISS in 6 hours.  Faster is better.
@adcunningham #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts The one I happen to be flying on at the time.  I flew Endeavour  Discovery  Atlantis.
@adcunningham @Astro_Kate7 @Space_Station @NASA #askNASA The ride will be the same but some improved systems will be used.
@MelissaHasBooks #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Normal trip always been 2 days so no changes needed. 6 hours is just better trajec
@HMS4824FAN @Space_Station @NASA_Astronauts #askNASA Use sleeping bags in capsule and small hab module.
@JulieHarden @Space_Station Wiki has good general description. New one looks same mostly. https://t.co/Q8VLoeqUXN
@JulieHarden #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Since this newer model Soyuz they want to check out systems before docking. Test drive
@rubeneo2014 #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts A cooling unit. Suits are very hot since the material doesn't breath
@hyperbola1 #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Both dock 2 ISS but launch from diff places means different trajectory but same result
@Monkeymafia1668 Moon landings are real.  Take some engineering classes and you'll learn that it is easier to go to moon than fake it.
@hyperbola1 #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Only 8.5 minutes to achieve orbit around the Earth. 2 days to chase down ISS.
@Monkeymafia1668 We train in pool but fly in space. Water bubbles form in space if water leaks.
@hyperbola1 #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts G's climb slowly but reach as high as 3 or more.
@502SpaceXfan #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts RP-1 and LOX I believe.
@Monkeymafia1668 Go outside into a yard and point camera down
@JohnD_Love #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts No. Once in zero-G they can float in very small volume of capsule and living module.
@rubeneo2014 @Space_Station @NASA_Astronauts #AskNASA ONe they reach orbit they can float out of their seats into a small volume.
@jean_labbe @Space_Station Search the internet for track the ISS. You will be able to put in your area and it will tell you exactly.
@rubeneo2014 #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Soyuz has small toilet and sleeping bags. A very small volume
@Rick5oh Absolutely.  They are constantly upgrading it and this is the latest version.
@Evhorizon @Astro_Clay Just like at home. On Station we turn the lights off when we go to bed and turn them on when we wake up.

@tanyaofmars @jccwrt @thomas_appere Some of the "motion" is just parallax  but there's 2 different motions  so 1 of them is actual motion :)
@MonicaKonrath yay! She looks great!
@Paladin1969 I think so. Got it on Amazon. The reviews were hilarious-- lots of adults complaining about how small it is.

@tedstryk @reddit in r/space someone usually eventually replies to original posting with source and link  which is better than nothing.
@tedstryk @asrivkin that's what the kids call a "joke" ;) I've done AMAs there and they were excellent  would 100% do again.

Would @ESA_EDM backshell detachment earlier than expected be consistent with too-rapid descent caused by a rip in the parachute?
A question for those of you who have been watching @ESA_EDM news closely....
This image is from Context Camera on MRO  which has 6-meter resolution. Better images to come from @HiRISE (30-cm resolution).

@esaoperations I understand @ESA_EDM is tweeting *expected* events. Are you tweeting only *actually detected* events or is it a mix of both?

@WilksJeremy @JanHattenbach haha and I'm following @esaoperations
Separation of @ESA_EDM from @ESA_TGO will happen at 14:42UT at spacecraft; it'll take about 10 min for change in radio signal to reach Earth

@mikeseibert @CaseyDreier This is one of the reasons @milkysa et al. are overhauling operations for Mars2020 to use a much shorter timeline.

@AstroKatie @_elbertina Yes  that's what I meant. Sorry. Jet lag making it hard to be coherent :)
@AstroKatie @_elbertina Actually the math checks out for that FOV at that altitude (the final images were windowed to 480 out of 2048 px)
@AstroKatie @_elbertina In the very last time step the FOV shrinks by 25% so I'm inclined to think it's from a lower altitude

I think I am going to be on BBC Radio 5 @bbc5live in 5 or 10 minutes to talk about @OSIRISREx... https://t.co/XWWHZpTMvI
Scott Messer: "The engineers were fighting with one another about who could be the most nominal." Those nutty engineers. @OSIRISREx
Dante Lauretta: "Y'all will be really glad to know we got everything exactly perfect." @OSIRISREx
Jim Green: "What's going to happen after the samples come back will be decades of study." @OSIRISREx
OSIRIS-REx is on its own now. Get those solar panels open and talk to @CanberraDSN please...
Centaur has begun to despin in preparation for spacecraft separation @OSIRISREx
The 15 minute coast is to make sure that good old reliable @CanberraDSN will be able to talk to the spacecraft during separation.
I won't relax until I know @OSIRISREx is generating solar power and communicating with Earth. Within an hour (hopefully) we'll know.
Everything continues fine for @OSIRISREx . Still waiting for 2nd Centaur burn  then spacecraft separation &amp; solar panel deploy
Release! LOOKS GOOD WE ARE GOING TO SPACE TODAY @OSIRISREx
T minus 4 minutes AND COUNTING Y'ALL @OSIRISREx
.@OSIRISREx "Launch on time verified." "solar radiation acceptable for launch." "all steps are complete prior to status check."
.@OSIRISREx spacecraft is now on internal power.
The final hold is a good time to tune in  because you'll get to listen another cool prelaunch poll https://t.co/yVbbgACKeI @OSIRISREx
T minus 4 minutes and holding. @OSIRISREx
Atlas and Centaur are reporting their loads of liquid oxygen and hydrogen are at flight levels -- they're ready to fly. @OSIRISREx
.@OSIRISREx will be NASA's first planetary mission launched since MAVEN in 2013  and the last until InSight in 2018.
It's T minus 10 minutes now  but there's a built-in 15-minute hold at T minus 4  so we're 25 minutes from @OSIRISREx launch.
1 hour from scheduled @OSIRISREx launch!
The NASA TV "public" and "media" feeds seem to be identical -- hope we get to listen to clean comm audio as @osirisrex launch approaches
Follow @SpaceflightNow and @S101_Live for the nitty gritty details on @OSIRISREx launch preparations. https://t.co/h1BfUAhZ1N
.@OSIRISREx could launch as early as 23:05 UTC; today's launch window is ~2 hours long  with launch opportunities every 5 minutes.
.@OSIRISREx countdown restarting at 2050 UTC. There'll be one more built-in hold in the countdown  at 4 minutes prior to launch.
Propulsion "ready" hydraulics "ready" pneumatics "ready" ... I loooooove the launch polls @OSIRISREx
NASA TV broadcast of @OSIRISREx launch coverage has started. Launch scheduled in ~2.5 hours. https://t.co/qO85RUH5E1
For questions about the @OSIRISREx mission  its timeline  goals  and instruments  check the @NASA press kit (PDF): https://t.co/OCSo8hWI9m

@AstroCook @verbiscer Looks like Quaoar would be a pretty great target for several reasons  actually. *sigh*
@ledahulevogyre @OlafFrohn Thank you for pointing that out -- I've fixed the problem.
@AstroCook @verbiscer @NASA @NASANewHorizons Cosign!
@mirikramer @RachelFeltman @NASA @NASANewHorizons Sadly  people's lack of familiarity with the cool worlds of the KB makes that unlikely.
@aussiastronomer yep.
@masequeira1 but it's kind of a cop-out to do that with an omnipotent character.
@masequeira1 I think maybe people enjoy the episodes because Picard is ordinarily so collected; they enjoy seeing him tested &amp; frustrated.
@masequeira1 I really enjoy DeLancie's acting so I think they're fun but I don't like the character's omnipotence so think stories are weak.
@tedstryk I get now why it's appropriate to include it but it took a lot of work with various data sets to see it that way.
@tedstryk That's not surprising  I used to leave out MVIC in things like this too  lumping it with things like VIMS.
@alexwitze I read biographies of Marie Curie and Marie Tharp back-to-back and the contrasts between the two Maries' treatment was :(
@AstroKatie @upulie whaaaaat
@tedstryk Done and done. Thanks :)
@tedstryk Can you email me a PNG? I'll swap it in to my article
@tedstryk That looks much nicer -- can't wait for them to release the raw data so you guys can have at it :)
@PlanetDr A statement that is probably true about an even larger fraction of planetary science papers :)
@PlanetDr This exchange could probably have referred to a substantial fraction of planetary science papers.
@megschwamb For science orbits  eventually  yes  but not for PJ1  evidently.
@hubbahubble People keep saying "space is something humanity does together" and I'm all "look at NASA panels  it's only part of humanity"
@hubbahubble I have been feeling precisely the same since the summer. Took all the joy out of Juno.
@tanyaofmars I am  coincidentally  wearing the exact same T-shirt today :)
WHOOOOOOO HOOOOOO YAAAAAYYYY TANYAAAAAA! @tanyaofmars  https://t.co/kNKZzpgCLH
@tanyaofmars you got this!
@starstryder "Mesa" means "table " so think an  elevated area  wide and flat on top  with steep sides.
@starstryder In my mind mesas are wider  while buttes are skinnier  but they're overlapping. Ones at Murray are buttes  very skinny at tops.

@erinleeryan @aussiastronomer Dang  I was off  I guessed Joshua Tree.
@CosmicRaymond @mbramble Failure of secondary mirror deployment would doom mission. Could still do some science w/o sunshade  side mirrors
For those of you who missed the informative @OSIRISREx press briefing today  a recording is now available: https://t.co/XAmYIYpV9K
@DrMRFrancis Nope. @jasonrdavis will be there.
Lauretta: Most exciting thing about any planetary mission is that you're going to a new world. [Cosigned.] @OSIRISREx
@OSIRISREx #AskNASA thank you!
.@OSIRISREx principal investigator @DSLauretta gives shoutout to Planetary Society for running Bennu naming contest https://t.co/vxvJHPf1vu
#askNASA When does instrument commissioning start? Are there plans to photograph Earth on departure? @OSIRISREx
The rest of the @OSIRISREx spacecraft has deep heritage from Stardust sample return &amp; MAVEN missions  among others.
Rich Kuhns: The TAGSAM sample arm concept began as a solo cup and an air compressor in a driveway :) #gottastartsomewhere @OSIRISREx
Lauretta: "We've done a great job convincing ourselves that Bennu has loose material on its surface" ....interesting wording. @OSIRISREx

@AndrewNCassidy It's a weird thing that iPhone camera software does with low signal-to-noise images - some photos look downright pointilist.
@vruba I would publish the heck out of that on the Planetary Society blog :)
@PlanetDr @nadiamdrake haha
@Alex_Parker @BezPublic @PlanetaryKeri @asrivkin @barbylon @mikeseibert @TheEarthStory OK who has a T-shirt store they can throw that in
@kchangnyt @mirikramer @afreedma I had no idea what you were talking about yesterday but now that I know all I can say is mmmm...rocky core.
@ageekmom No that is the one from this morning
@NASAJPL @NASAJuno @lizlandau @VeronicaMcG Where can I find the JunoCam movie?
@ScottWx_TWN That's the version they released this morning  only 1 Io orbit worth.
@AstroKatie @BadAstronomer @sondy Hahahaha
@LongHairNasaGuy ha that sounds about right!
@alexwitze Blarg.
@alexwitze Are you having any better luck getting confirmation of spacecraft timeline events where you are than we are?
@GeertHub You might be right but I'm not hearing anything -- are you getting any audio on that channel?
Next #Juno event expected in ~10 minutes. I have to run off to do @bbc5live interview in meantime...
@kchangnyt @nadiamdrake @alexwitze @RachelFeltman @mirikramer @lorengrush The sad parts are "alone" and "dark" whisky would make all better
@mirikramer @alexwitze @RachelFeltman @lorengrush I brought fruit and cheese sticks and granola bars for everybody come ask me!
Dear UK insomniacs: I should be on @bbc5live at 3:50.
@NovaSilisko @PlanetDr It is the approach movie described in https://t.co/kl4CwpKlP2
@PlanetDr I had a fun conversation with Jim Green about how cool these pictures were :)
@markmccaughrean @badastronomer Proof: https://t.co/2IOtYyqNRO
@markmccaughrean @badastronomer Policy was changed during cruise  before SOI.
@markmccaughrean @badastronomer Cassini did it from SOI.
@sumnerd @BadAstronomer Cameras were on until 5 days before JOI. They've released 3 processed images  1 processed movie  no raws.
@tanyaofmars @BadAstronomer No  they are MARCI-like -- pushframe  a bit challenging to work with  but the amateurs can handle them.
[Everybody please direct some love at Madrid  Goldstone  &amp; @CanberraDSN stations for bringing us all our space science &amp; engineering data.]
Goldstone will be the prime Deep Space Network station receiving Juno signals tonight  on 5 dishes  with 4 dishes at @CanberraDSN as backup.
@alexwitze planet on steroids
@jonny_nichols @BBCAmos @chrislintott I don't have one of those handy water heating teapots  sorry to the Brits!
@masequeira1 no  it's much too far away. Spacecraft are only directly observable when they're quite close to Earth.
@YazzieSays I didn't know Amtrak had cars like that!
@AscendingNode I'll be producing one of my patented* browse index pages to the data set to help people find data  *not actually patented

@marsroverdriver @milkysa Please tag me out of this I'm trying to focus on Juno
@Econopete @NzRv It's 1/4 scale.
@marsroverdriver *Many* kinds of disabilities are addressed by microphones  just as many others are by ramps/elevators.
@marsroverdriver You're lucky you don't constantly have to think about managing a disability. World would be kinder if more people did think
@marsroverdriver Try to think about the experience of a person constantly in this situation.
@marsroverdriver @michaelaye Guys  look up "cruel". Just because it's not intended cruelty doesn't mean it isn't experienced as cruel
@megschwamb @chrislintott that's good to hear!
@arielwaldman @tweetsoutloud true but MRO is seriously old. If it's not TGO then it's NASA's telecom orbiter with a HiRISE duplicate.
@tweetsoutloud @arielwaldman highly likely to have been @ESA_TGO?
@mikamckinnon I bet they did it to replace with an accessible sidewalk ramp  which is a worthy thing to do
@PlanetDr @sondy @AstroCook @Alex_Parker eat  drink  and be merry....

@cirquelar haha I was wondering about that. Great graphic :) Really like the different icons for different types of science sites.
@mikamckinnon Look at the list of speakers from the gullies workshop @tanyaofmars is attending this week?
@sumnerd I like the little bitty MER head on the tippy top of the mast and because that's not high enough they put a UHF antenna on top
@AscendingNode @NovaSilisko AFAIK  Night driving was about low-temperature dry-lubricated motors  a development effort that failed in 2007
@starstryder @bug_gwen I literally read this tweet while snacking

@uniquename439 BOOOOOOOOOO
@JPMajor God I dislike that metaphor.
@PlanetDr did the @booplefloof s participate in the vigil?
@Stephist @NASAJuno I support this line of research
@PlanetDr well I can't argue with that.
@PlanetDr someone on the internet somewhere is keeping vigil. You go be the best you by sleeping.
@LDMay @JaredEspley maybe this is all part of my secret plan to annihilate excessive acronym use :)
@PlanetDr nice  I hadn't seen that one.

@PlanetDr Hey  who's the person who taught you about the concept of the "invisible chapter?"
@b3ko No  mostly just used NASA's Eyes on the Solar System for 3D views; plus photos taken at NASA Kennedy; and Illustrator to plan it
@Econopete Yup.

@erichand Congratulations! Also "news that matters to the cognoscenti" lol
@astroengine @StartsWithABang What will *definitely* kill Curiosity  if nothing else does  is the slow decline in RTG power output.
@astroengine @StartsWithABang We may see a grouser on a middle wheel fail soon  which could lead to dramatic increase in damage rate.
@astroengine @StartsWithABang That report was mine :) I guess it's time for an update  to clarify misunderstandings.
@StartsWithABang Rate of damage has slowed dramatically  and Mars Yard testing has shown the rover can drive with 2/3 of wheel shredded off.
@StartsWithABang I don't think you can say the wheels will be cause of failure  or that they will prevent the rover from exploring Mt Sharp.

@kejames I was once asked to give a keynote talk about space imaging...and the A/V equipment failed. I still gave an awesome talk. So 👍
@markmccaughrean They had UV data  which gave them the clouds  which is neat; I just wish they had also released a more realistic view.
@jeff_foust @OSIRISREx Jealous!
@Alex_Parker @blakestacey @FishEcon @SungrazerComets @ellipsix @aussiastronomer @Frescovic Thanks.
@hauck I learned this a few years ago. I'm glad reviewers don't have to do it  but I wish journals edited text to improve the prose.

@_hroe @PlanetDr I began my science writing career writing Web updates about Cassini.
@lukedones the real question is: which will eventually actually happen first  fusion or Mars sample return?

@rolfje Nah  it's really the sort of thing the platform needs to fix. But thanks
@rolfje Is being bombarded by hate speech and being sent intentionally traumatizing imagery part of the "open platform" thing you like?
@rolfje You get a lot of death threats and doxing on here?
@DrNeilTyson ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@TrueSciPhi I find this kind of analysis absolutely fascinating  even though it always feels a bit like schoolyard gossip
@itsa_talia Your real friends live in Twitter and they would not be so rude as to make you leave the house
@Annaleen 😕 I don't like Halloween either - awful people use it as an excuse to be more awful than usual
@amyekimball @j_bellovary Nice!
@gargpit Yeah
@smenor @NforNihilism I shouldn't pay attention at all. The numbers don't really matter
@mpesce @marovdan The data suggest it  but currently need more observations to say definitively
@NforNihilism I actually get a lot of followers when I tweet politics  so it wouldn't surprise me if some of them left
Here are six different views of the Moon from @LRO_NASA -- we only see the one in the upper left (from… https://t.co/la9Sk6kD0n
This visualization of the rotating Moon from @LRO_NASA data is lovely &amp; hypnotic: https://t.co/ucAx9Vnxda (also probably good for insomnia)
@methylnick It's so good!
@Alex_Parker @cirquelar Yes like that!
@AussiePhinatic @KIPAC1 That's kinda hard to say -- depends what you mean by detected/detectable. Evidence for DM in inner galaxy.
@cirquelar I mean the large-scale shape of the universe might be different. For instance  in AdS space  negative curvature.
@cirquelar Not necessarily  but possibly -- it's more that the shape of spacetime is different in some of the cases studied.
@cwmagee I think so  because the mathematical machinery it's building could become unbelievably powerful
@bwecht @mcnees Like  dark matter &amp; strong CP aren't really separate problems if you have an axion. But should've said "also prolly not TOE"
@bwecht @mcnees The few comments I did send were along the lines of "authors aren't crackpots but this isn't as remarkable as it sounds"
@mcnees @bwecht  I mean it honestly didn't occur to me that they'd go with a headline saying "solves" without even a qualifier
@MJIBrown Hopefully people will check date before rushing outside at least!
@mcnees @bwecht I was asked for comment on this study &amp; I didn't have time so I suggested someone else but I kinda wish I'd said something…
@GrahamBowes @Space_Station Whoa!!
@MJIBrown That was gorgeous -- thanks for the heads-up! :)
@JimCriz Oh that one's all right
@upulie Also the information that does escape the black hole in that particular theory is unrecognizably scrambled so uh yeah.
Be especially suspicious of images of eclipses  "giant voids in space"  supermoons  &amp; exploding stars. And follow @FakeAstropix &amp; @PicPedant
@AndrewNCassidy Yep
@darth @mackenzievogt You can't even fav DMs which is just unfair
@jen_gupta It's definitely hot chocolate then! (Your secret is safe with me!)
@jen_gupta 🐶🍫☕️ (added tea just in case)
@GerardoBarbosa @planet4589 @PeterDEdmonds Twitter is a strange place!
@planet4589 @PeterDEdmonds @NASA Oh you guys 😳
@PeterDEdmonds @NASA @TrueSciPhi 😳
@emoontx I do this ALL the time. Or mute for same reason
@Real_Johannes_P You sound like you need the sleep  good night
@Real_Johannes_P Hate to break it to you dude but it's nighttime.
@franco_vazza @PeterDEdmonds https://t.co/Kdlil6B9Zm
@darth I'm saying maybe we don't wanna open the box to find out darth
@darth In some cases a wave can act as a particle  maybe the apparent marbles were just an interference effect
@darth Are you assuming prior hingedness and marble-having because this may be the problem
@mcnees That article doesn't even get the difference between dark matter and dark energy
@HilaryKHarper @CassiniSaturn @kevinmgill I will be happy to be proved wrong!
@PeterDEdmonds For one  yeah
@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 OK here's a short (but technical) post on what's wrong with the analysis: https://t.co/Kdlil6B9Zm
@IreneElisabethH @CosmosMagazine Thank you! :)
@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 It still finds strong evidence for acceleration. Just not as strong as some others who use different assumptions.
@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 I'm not expert enough on supernova systematics to say what's up w new analysis  but it doesn't change anything
@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 Sorry for the brief responses -- I've been out and unable to answer in detail. Basically  tons of evidence for DE
@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 It's really not
@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 No
@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 Depends what you mean by "indirect." Lots of evidence for acceleration and/or for an extra component of universe
@selennata @starstryder I'm really not sure what you're referring to here
@alienghic Well I have definitely received quite a few "good job well done"s in response here
@NforNihilism I don't know!
@jpdowling @ScienceAlert Sure  testing/verifying results is. Headlines that make it sound settled  not so much. :/
@jpdowling @ScienceAlert Also this write-up misrepresents claim (weak evidence for acceleration  not evidence against) &amp; confuses DM &amp; DE…
@jpdowling @ScienceAlert *say one group of authors  using a new technique  whereas other techniques &amp; data sets strongly say opposite
@MisfitDeveloper No one is saying hard work is a bad thing
@mcnees Yep. I had to block hundreds of accounts after their brute squad put out a tweet about me to their disciples.
@mcnees I mean they're just explicitly parroting Trump campaign talking points now
@mikamckinnon @dragonarchitect Aww 💔
@noah_anyname https://t.co/ZMeVE2OdCr 😕
@DarryWillis I hate them too but I haven't seen it reported elsewhere
@darth 4) Blame Michelle Obama
@physicsjackson @jr_pritchard Yep! :)
@elSpike @corbett @tweetsoutloud 😀
@bencubby Never pass up a chance for a cheap wormhole joke
@CaliaDomenico What link? It's important to give credit when sharing creations like this.
@niais @merrdiff @johannateske @chgreer @jegpeek Yeah the full thing was long but if you skip based on hearing titles it was like 20 min.
@kejames @rocketman528 @CaliaDomenico Graphic is by NASA  apparently. See credit here: https://t.co/GCZ4Evc5zO
@hanipersian Thanks!
@CaliaDomenico Did you make this graphic?
@RobertGaristo @PhysRevLett Maybe you can convince airline security to relax liquid restrictions for BYO radiation shielding
@upulie @KetanJ0 It was v good movie despite misleading title
@upulie @KetanJ0 @guardian https://t.co/pmOyghGCzG ?
@tweetsoutloud @JamesSACorey @AquaBirdie OK yes I will do this
Which is all to say: would've been great if @ESA_EDM had worked perfectly but there's still TONS of AMAZING #ExoMars science coming at you.
@ionn @BreakfastNews I'm not sure  but if I get a recording of it I'll tweet the link!
@murielsoz Thank you!
Here's a brief clip from my appearance on @BreakfastNews today  talking about #ExoMars and why Mars is so difficult: https://t.co/JPwhqNlby4
@itsa_talia As much fun as it always is to get yelled at by Trump supporters for days  I might sit this one out
@PeterBell7 @anusha_srini @BreakfastNews Is there a Vine recording somewhere?
@DaveCurran99 I'm not sure how Musk plans to deal with it. I'd expect he'll use some kind of heat shield -&gt; parachute -&gt; rocket combo.
@lorengrush @alexwitze @mirikramer @RachelFeltman It's deeply unfair that the debates fall right in the middle of my workday
@lorengrush @alexwitze @mirikramer @RachelFeltman 😖
@algi80 It's less comfortable  feels weird.
@ZULU401 @BreakfastNews All the scientists are on Earth  getting paid to create new innovative technologies that improve Earth
@remybergsma NO SLEEP MARS WILL EAT ME
24-hour 🚀 recap: * 2 people ➡️ Tiangong 2 space station 🤗 * 3 in Soyuz 🔜 @Space_Station  * @ESA_TGO 😎 * @ESA_EDM 😊🤔😧 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ * @NASAJuno 😴
@SciGuySpace ☹️
@SciGuySpace JUNO IS GONNA BE OK
I'll be on @BreakfastNews at half past to talk about #ExoMars!
Update on #ExoMars: all looks good for orbiting @ESA_TGO; status of @ESA_EDM lander still unclear: https://t.co/JMzmTyIkHx
@darth THE POTATOES NEED OUR HELP DARTH
@mcnees Apocaless?
@mcnees But  hey  June was revised down  so  uh  that's… less apocalyptic?
@itsa_talia Oh so that's what happens when the eggs hatch
@Pillownaut It's incredible
@DeschampsPat @jonrosenberg You're welcome! Check this one out: https://t.co/NGv3No2SAK
@ycopfiles You should do this for everyone whose words you copy  to give attribution  because that's how most ppl read tweets. All the best.
@ycopfiles Retweet is perfectly adequate. Format you used is used for tweeting to a person. Quotes around my words would've been clearer
@ycopfiles You could just retweet. Or quote tweet.
@ycopfiles Putting my name at the end isn't giving me credit  that's not how it works
@ycopfiles Why are you copy-pasting my tweet back to me in this bizarre way?
@DeschampsPat @jonrosenberg There are several dark matter detectors! They work differently from SuperK but are underground.
@tcortellesi I'll be very happy! And scared.
@sgtMIKE2 ORLY?
@MisfitDeveloper Applied twice! Didn't quite get to interview stage  alas
@DrMRFrancis @AmeliaHammy I can definitely deliver on the promise
@DrMRFrancis @AmeliaHammy Mine is "😕"
@jarrodthekiwi Some are from shared block lists (so  probably  to others)  some were abusive to me  some I just didn't want to deal with
@cdodrun "Block and move on" is easy to say when you only have a few followers! I blocked at least 50 accounts yesterday.
@patronaut0709 Yeah but she doesn't seem to use it
@itsa_talia Someday.....
@itsa_talia Erm...
@upulie I always thought being a sock puppet would pay better and involve less astrophysics research
@IbnulHussaini Size of observable universe same  total mass same. But distribution of matter different than previously observed.
@atAjithJ @ska_papers Depending on which data sets &amp; analyses you believe  it's been ruled out for many years.
@SlowWaterMvmnt You can untag me from this discussion
@MisfitDeveloper @astroduff No
@aliceinthewater I don't think so
@AndrewNCassidy Oh it's way worse. Dark energy is ~70% of universe. Matter only ~30%  of which most dark.
@JeremyCaron Hm I'll tweet a bit about it hold on
@RyanWVoll You could still read my tweets if I muted you (but don't worry I don't plan to!)
@Mr_5h33pD06 OK thanks.
@AndrewNCassidy :(
@chiIIinois Have a wonderful day
@chiIIinois All the best to you
@chiIIinois I have no idea why it was bombed. I'm a pacifist.
@rdrimmel Sure.
@FernRoyal https://t.co/F1ZetzG9so
@FernRoyal No  it's just a different understanding of how it's all distributed.
@REasther @kevinschawinski @tpoi @Medium A lot of job/fellowship applications forbid listing papers that aren't published in journals.
@mcnees 😦
@physicsjackson @gfbertone In what context?
@mattmfm @darth I can't even fix this with only a single alternate reality guys
@xeni @BoingBoing 🤔
@lyndalovon @CosmosMagazine Not yet
@Mk2Salamnder @BeCurieus @Antiproton_com @realscientists Sure  I'd be up for it
@DrRubidium I mean seriously half the stuff he's denying is literally on tape what is he even bothering with this for
@DrRubidium 🎶 "She even caught me on camera!" 🎶
@JoshuaGuess Totally agree!
@GerardoBarbosa @LaskyPaul @novapbs I don't think that will take long!
@kevinmgill Is this a visualization or a composite from real images?
@mikeynerd 😇
@MJIBrown So  outdated already
@eqe @micahflee Yeah I discussed this a bit with another person. https://t.co/MrbXZB1rmn
@TheTXFlash All the best to you
@MBBrownSF Hm maybe I should correct though I don't think most people would know distinction so probably not particularly misleading really
@MBBrownSF Distinction is sued for vs charged with?
@poloniumman That's one of the things we're trying to find out!
@astrodave2 See my feed!
@mcnees STAR EATER SQUIRREL!
@nillie_kj https://t.co/XMxivETESc
@EzoszResyek All the best to you and goodbye.
@AstroPJJ That's what I mean by "something we can see" here: https://t.co/Td7ZEd8FSG Could be quarks  leptons  bosons...
@TheN5OfOntario Same kind of thing. But a dark matter particle might be its own antiparticle 😳
@thefooleryoftom Check the link -- that's 8 hours
@jarrodthekiwi @RogerLickers @jonrosenberg *bracing for inevitable burrito joke  because someone ALWAYS makes it*
.@jarrodthekiwi @RogerLickers @jonrosenberg So much stuff is going through you. #DarkMatter  neutrinos  cosmic rays  gravitational waves…
@jpdowling @jonrosenberg …but that doesn’t work if no non-gravitational interactions.
@jpdowling @jonrosenberg Usual assumption is #DarkMatter came out of primordial soup (end of cosmic inflation) along wit everything else.
.@jpdowling @jonrosenberg If #DarkMatter ONLY interacts gravitationally  we have a bigger mystery: how it got here in the first place!
@IanPAMacDonald @jonrosenberg All of the above  in different ways!
@voidshaper Ha  probably not  actually. They’re a cool idea though!
.@cwmagee There are limits on dark matter particle mass. (Given some assumptions.) Usual assumed range: between ~0.1 &amp; 10 000 x proton mass
@MultipleNights @jonrosenberg That’s true — within our Solar System  way more regular matter than dark — DM is more evenly distributed here
@algi80 Pretty much! Done it once as actual research. Mostly just like to see stuff.
.@MisfitDeveloper Surprisingly difficult to make #DarkMatter go into a #BlackHole! Doesn’t lose energy via collisions  just orbits forever
@LarryWest42 @jamie_hall Sterile neutrinos aren’t in the Standard Model. (Technically  no massive neutrinos are!)
@tinapanossian Nah  because as Universe expands it gets less dense  so dark matter particles will meet each other less often.
@AJPearson23 @elakdawalla She is following me! :)
@Pharaoness Aw thank you Sophia! &lt;3
@ChefSJ Awesome! :)
@GerryGonzalo @tanyaofmars @duffy_ma Um  probably  but specific point here is that GRE is a bad criterion that exacerbates inequality
@itsa_talia It's pretty darn good sometimes
@noah_anyname Ah  this is a good point
@Lavochka_Poseyd You can remove me from this discussion if you want to continue it
@Roy_Astro @tweedishgirl @CassiniSaturn Yep  that's Prometheus. See info in link I tweeted.
@GerryGonzalo @tanyaofmars @duffy_ma More white male correlates with higher GRE score  but higher GRE score doesn't correlate with success
@darth @kmattio @ericgeller Is it marzipan because marzipan is very nice
@haywal83 :(
@altvarg That's her podium  not his.
@Paleophile I watched the last one and pulse went through the roof  hands shook. Don't really want to go through that again.
@physicsmatt OK sounds good. You're the one with the LHC connection but lemme know if I can tweak any numbers for you
@stoutde Yes I have already decided to vote against the Nazi.
@_TheGeoff Apologies for what?
@BadPhysics @hataroni (Also: I sometimes check Tweetbot or Tweetdeck for quote-tweets)
@BadPhysics @hataroni (delete one of the "I don't know" things in there  my brain is destroyed from packing)
@BadPhysics @hataroni Which  I don't know  maybe is true  I dunno.
@BadPhysics @hataroni Yeah  at the moment mostly people saying a theoretical candidate horrible to women of color only would be electable.
@rolfje No  no notifications  just the notifications timeline tab
@hataroni Yes  the patented @BadPhysics Method!
@BadPhysics Your hybrid quote-tweets are the best.
@nika82016 I'm bisexual and proud to be in the LGBT community. All the best to you.
@uniquename439 None. I have to give them all back to the box company.
@pjf "it is our destiny to explore the far frontiers of space" &lt;- yes v good
@pjf This is very good and helpful thank you
@pjf Thanks! Checking it out.
@EzoszResyek All the reports I've seen say about 1 in 4 for assault. For rape  numbers vary quite a lot -- seen anything from 1/4 to 1/7.
@BadPhysics No  it's a very local move
@President_Bunny Nah  nothing like that. My landlord sold my apartment out from under me.
@MisfitDeveloper Books don't make anywhere near that kind of money. (And I don't have that kind of time right now!)
@upulie @mpesce Yes v close
@upulie @mpesce New one will have sunset  which is OK I guess
@upulie @mpesce New apartment has other views  not as nice. Is bigger so will need to have company more often I guess.
@upulie @mpesce It was the best apartment  with the best views.
@upulie @mpesce I am really sad to lose it. 😥
@aussiastronomer @jason__rhodes Pls take me with you next time
@SlotmachinQueen Bill Clinton isn't running for president. All the best to you.
@SlotmachinQueen Amazing what powerful lawyers can get dismissed on technicalities. (See Snopes piece for details.)
@alexwitze @Fahrenthold He's doing great things but it's only redemption if the voters care
@sciencebrunch Yikes  I hadn't heard that!
@Spacecolonize https://t.co/MiEto8N20N
@Leaving_Orbit :(
@itsa_talia Not to be confused with RuPaul
@itsa_talia There are too many Pauls and Ryans and Rands and Ayns
@itsa_talia I am worried that when Florida destruction hits TV everyone will forget Haiti
@part_ickle See few tweets following up; am discussing with people
@jarrodthekiwi Not stuff like this. Cosmic rays might affect cloud cover at a very small level. (See e.g. https://t.co/vJyaI77obi)
@mikeynerd And the Meteors!
@MisfitDeveloper Oh well! Thank you for checking. :)
@DrMRFrancis Yeah I usually tweet on my phone so I'm just in the habit now of doing it there.
@MisfitDeveloper @tauriqmoosa Thanks  I'll try that! (Do you know if they can be seen on the mobile app?)
@itsmeaghanns Early universe stuff... cosmic strings  primordial black holes  axions. All theoretical things!
@kevinschawinski Are you going to share with the class?
@rolfje It doesn't match field demographics in physics. Pretty sure not in other areas either.
@itsa_talia @kahoakes Tiniest robot war!
@travelanita Oh I guess having some merit is a thing only men do.
@BoingBoing OMG I love this
@kejames Oh wow
@jegpeek Hm maybe yeah
@michelle_lmc At what point are the women below the measurement noise? &lt;1% now.
@michelle_lmc Word
@michelle_lmc Male Nobel Laureate tally now at 201!
@upulie @gbricketts Cosmology is a sub-field of astrophysics it's all good
@apdmassey Physics is the worst  statistically  of the original prizes
@aliceinthewater 😒
@pauldcox @vohbo Pulsars got a prize  but Bell-Burnell wasn't one of the recipients.
@vohbo You're correct  but neither has received the prize for these discoveries. (Both still alive: J Bell-Burnell and V Rubin.)
@natmcmolecule @joabbess OK thanks for letting me know
@mikeynerd Thank you! :)
@DrMRFrancis Wise man.
@PenguinGalaxy But what about DARK CHOCOLATE  Alice? NOT ALL CHOCOLATE
@natmcmolecule @joabbess @n1vux It's a picture that hasn't changed in decades. Also no one requires equal numbers in high school.
@natmcmolecule @joabbess https://t.co/xhoQcFcqtz
@BespokeCheese @DrMRFrancis @REasther Omg dude if you unironically use SJW as an insult you are following the wrong astrophysicist
Check out these pieces by @DrMRFrancis https://t.co/bn7qCLB5ul &amp; @REasther https://t.co/epaSxi0mCF on culture of physics vs the Nobel Prize
@DrMRFrancis In case you haven't seen it yet  @REasther covers a related set of issues with the prize here: https://t.co/epaSxi0mCF
@upulie Just the usual  "why are people talking about [celebrity] instead of Nobel Prize?"
@JohnRSports @upulie Tweeting about what?
@RyanWVoll Well that dude doesn't know anything about my job but I am on a fixed-term contract at the moment. Academia's a tough gig.
@itsa_talia Surely the fact that he said over and over again that he would (eventually) release his taxes himself also has some bearing
@homeruntrots @darth I think a poodle mix? Not sure. He is not my dog  alas
@darth He is leaning sleepily I think he might be nodding off but when he really sleeps his tongue comes out a bit https://t.co/KNxcBBjFvk
@darth it was so good darth he is a very good dog
@darth did you see this
@himanisharma Yep! She doesn't use it a lot though
@DaveCurran99 Nope
@R_Trotta @gravitate_to_me The majority of people who have power to actually do something don't seem to care  or want to make changes.
@GeoSciTweeps Is he? That's really cool!
@R_Trotta Unfortunately I haven't seen anything like a culture change happening. :/
@GeoSciTweeps Oh I think maybe I was at that one! Well  I was at a dinner at Lloyd House he attended.
@MarvinDMartian2 @marsroverdriver @tootallrutt Planned impact speed was about 0.9m/s but I don't know if they got measurements
@lukedones @michael_w_busch Oh I know. It’s just frustrating when it’s not possible to say EVERYTHING  you know?
@lukedones @michael_w_busch In full interview I might have said something like “we think asteroids or comets” but can’t recall exactly.
@lukedones @michael_w_busch The quote in the image doesn’t make a claim  for instance — just says we’re learning. Can’t remember exact words
@lukedones @michael_w_busch Whenever I talk about it online or in the media I try to be equivocal since it’s not settled. I was last night.
@lukedones @michael_w_busch Yeah a lot of that stuff is interesting. There’s tons of evidence in several directions; still unclear what’s up
@Kupeplex @thefooleryoftom :D I love @planetforgium
@FlyingFiretruck @ABCNews24 @bevvo14 Dude I don't think you want to go down this road
@kejames I'm imagining tapping it with a spoon like a soft-boiled egg
@thefooleryoftom Ah  ESA sent it to me after an outreach event. No idea where to get one otherwise though I think 3D print info is out there
@Space_Mog @NLchemist Rosetta has already been with the comet for perihelion once: https://t.co/W4zNqEzenn
@gargpit Around 6 years
@EricFielding @GeoSciTweeps @Philae2014 Do you know of any estimates about how long the orbit will remain stable?
@SFriedScientist @RachelFeltman It'd be interesting to see cash breakdown -- raw value of hardware (space) vs jobs (here) in mission budget
@elakdawalla @_elbertina At 51m?
@elakdawalla @_elbertina Also if it's a wide angle camera it seems like a field of view of 2.4m more plausible from 5m up than 51
@elakdawalla @_elbertina Ah  thanks! Let us know if you find out?
@_elbertina Perhaps @elakdawalla could clear it up?
@_elbertina Could they have misspoken on the stream?
@_elbertina Official Twitter feed also saying 51 meters though
@_elbertina Hm I dunno. Maybe image caption is wrong?
@tinapanossian Thank you! (If we get more on this planet does that mean I'm free to go to space?)
@robcarrphoto Final velocity probably around 1 m/s. Unlikely to make a crater  probably largely intact
@mattkronner Nah  amino acids are "pre-biotic" -- they are ingredients of life  but not byproducts of it or evidence it's there
@aliceinthewater Well  bounce/walk maybe. Moon is 1/6 gravity of Earth; Mars is about 1/3.
@aliceinthewater Sure
@Qldaah @mareetimms @ABCNews24 It means I work with theories  not observations. I use computers &amp; math instead of telescopes!
@mareetimms @ABCNews24 Aw thank you! :)
@RachelFeltman @esaoperations @Philae2014 It's not right
@bevvo14 @ABCNews24 I hope you have a box of tissues over there  it's gonna be a sad one
@upulie @DustinWelbourne 😟
@DustinWelbourne @upulie Did something happen on the live stream?
I’ll be going on @ABCNews24 in about an hour to talk about what @ESA_Rosetta taught us. #CometLanding… https://t.co/DCnTyer5Bm
@JPMajor :’(
“It’s about human beings. It’s about our birthplace in the Solar System” - @markmccaughrean explains significance of Rosetta. #CometLanding
@thePancakeBot It’s pretty black! https://t.co/loDe974yal
“Rosetta has made us have to change our ideas of what comets are” - @mggtTaylor on @ESA_Rosetta livestream. #CometLanding #GoodbyeRosetta
@DrMRFrancis I WON’T CRY I’M NOT GOING TO CRY
@upulie @ESA_Rosetta 67P isn’t a sun-grazer  though  so hopefully will be OK for a while!
@upulie @ESA_Rosetta They will travel together on their little home until the end of the Solar System
@DattaguruP -&gt; https://t.co/wnxsBUn4wp
@DattaguruP It’s sort of at the right edge of the “head” part of the comet in that picture. See here for exact spot: https://t.co/trWA2PUNQ8
Some good accounts to follow for the #GoodbyeRosetta #CometLanding: @ESA_Rosetta  @elakdawalla  @mggtTaylor  @markmccaughrean  @MonicaGrady
@NforNihilism Well it might land in a deep pit so sorta
@markmccaughrean I will treasure it always!
@markmccaughrean I'm taking my mini-comet with me on the show  by the way!
@markmccaughrean I'm going on TV about an hour after the landing; I'm not entirely sure I'll hold it together and I'm not even involved!
@markmccaughrean @bbc5live @ESA_Rosetta Nice interview!
@cirquelar @astroengine @elakdawalla Is it cryobraking?
@jarrodthekiwi @Ksnickers @JPMajor @ESA_Rosetta This little comet model is roughly true color: https://t.co/zt7Qul1fZq
@itsa_talia @JPMajor @ESA_Rosetta How much speed  yeah. For Earth  it's about 11 km/s. For Comet 67P  something like 1 m/s -- walking speed!
@MisfitDeveloper I actually didn't realize she did! She's super cool!
@gayathrikamath Aw thank you :)
@AstroPJJ ☺️
@Tweitzel @ESA_Rosetta Nah  everything will be shut down before impact and then it'll physically break. :/
@PeterDEdmonds Someone give me millions of dollars
@ProfMike_M Thank you! I heard it a few times in a meeting where I was one of only two women &amp; I knew other didn't care. No one corrected.
@lachlanmartin @ProfMike_M Person hours. Staff hours. Work units  if defined.
@stoutde Also that the big things &amp; little things are completely unrelated
@Lydeey  -&gt; https://t.co/Qt2HxWGVGC
@Lydeey @astrolisa Why is realistic skepticism automatically negative?
@thefooleryoftom You are the 7th person to suggest that  a thing that is in the article I tweeted. 😐
@tobadzistsini Godwin's Law doesn't apply when the comparison is apt &amp; crucial to the discussion. Look it up if you need to!
@uniquename439 A common  tragic situation
@jonrosenberg @CNN I think he is being given a lot of extra points for resisting making reference to his penis
@CNN @jonrosenberg I don't understand how 38% of people could see that debate and think "Trump did well!"
@dd9000 @FakeUnicode @Dictionarycom Darn lexicographical clickbait
@astrokatey @davecl42 Think of your friends everywhere!
@ScienceNelson She has had a LOT of practice
@kevinschawinski I mean to me it looked like a train wreck for Trump but I don’t know how his voters feel.
@esargent184 @Paleophile Word.
@kejames @SpaceAssocOz I can't believe it either
@planet4589 @DownHereOnEarth "habitability of icy worlds" sounds promising!
@concernecus Ha I was teasing! I don't know where the astrophysicists near you are but you should find them  they're probably cool
@concernecus Why do you hate astrophysicists Brendan
@PatrickRuffini @JayAlver @RawStory No  Elon's climate response is electric cars &amp; batteries for renewable energy. Space stuff is separate.
@mcnees Let's give him more credit — totally possible he did both.
@dd9000 I find the visual stuff helpful  but in the end it has to work with the math too
@kevinschawinski Hm good point  but there's also the Heat Death  the Big Rip  and vacuum decay to consider. I say we split it.
@DattaguruP Is that some kind of a joke?
@ChrisDudley85 I really have no idea why you're trying to argue with me on this  but it's incredibly tedious. Bye! 👋🏼
@ChrisDudley85 Cute but no you don't get to tell me what to say about the subjects of my professional work.
@ChrisDudley85 @KittyCaffeinato @DrFunkySpoon Glad to hear you enjoyed your class. All the best &amp; goodbye.
@ChrisDudley85 @DrFunkySpoon Dude are you trying to explain astrophysics to me? 'Cause I don't think you should.
@HiRISE What is this?
@ChrisDudley85 @DrFunkySpoon I can say a lot of words! Language is wonderful that way.
@upulie Yeah pretty sure not
@RiAus I'd take one-way!
@medicmsh3141 Totally! My peak wavelength is around 10 microns  in the infrared
#Mars is just ridiculously beautiful and fascinating https://t.co/7JhtIiNI2w (image by @HiRISE  blog/info by… https://t.co/iGvGsjTCsZ
@fladdle It's more Earth-like  so that's a big part of it. And there are indications it used to have liquid water  so maybe life(?)
@TakeThatHistory @OnieXOX Uh hi I'm not an astronaut I'm an astrophysicist but I don't see why both KK &amp; I can't be role models in diff ways
@Widainmor Bye.
@icarusfactor You may have misunderstood concept of "vacation"
@kevinschawinski https://t.co/FXVcZrjHxA
@kevinschawinski Hello! (I'm in Queensland at the moment)
@EastBayBruce Didn't see any but wore stinger suit anyway
@EastBayBruce No  alas
@DaveCurran99 Not sure but my understanding is that the damage is driven by climate &amp; things like development  not tourism.
@seakaterun @sandentotten 😃😳
@NoyzeSmythe Feel free to continue your discussion with that person without me
@AndrewJYoungs My activism includes actually doing everything possible to make world better  not turning my nose up bc I don't like system
@AndrewJYoungs Gonna be a HECK of a lot harder to make progress on anything if Trump wins.
@coreyspowell @Helen_E_MC Oh no
@CameronAuclair4 @cpwernham No clue what you're trying to say now  but all the best.
@CameronAuclair4 @cpwernham Maybe he is happily sleeping around. Again  I honestly do not care  as he is not running for president.
@AndrewJYoungs I think it's weird to see voting as endorsement of anything. I see it as choosing which future will make my activism easier
@AndrewJYoungs Voting isn't about endorsement  it's just choosing which future to help bring forward. There are two futures. Choose or not.
@jtotheizzoe @SciDebate She knows this is going out to a science-concerned audience  but it matters what she says to general public too.
@jtotheizzoe @SciDebate Sounds about right  though I'd probably deduct a bit for Stein's previous statements  since these are so different.
@lshapiro30 No  it's the same issue. Stealing content  pretending it's your own
@PedroPeros Well the announcement was more recent
@markmccaughrean Dude you're doing the wink thing again
@_Insomnious_ Gahhhhh
@DaveCurran99 Find a hobby that isn't hostile to others
@DenzildeanNY All the best to you
@mikeynerd :) I'm from LA  it's a thing. I also say "awesome" way too much
@stoutde No worries  it happens
@DenzildeanNY I don't blame anyone for blocking anyone else. Always a free &amp; reasonable choice.
@hankgreen @jtotheizzoe @smartereveryday Ugh wait hold on didn't even mention awesomely fascinating AI subplot
@jtotheizzoe @smartereveryday It's so good!
@DuttonChemistry @NthChapter Yeah I have it pretty good here. I guess I meant it's hard to imagine that being the case generally
@WallaceMarkS *faves while walking*
@NthChapter I can't even *imagine* a future in which postdocs are compensated in accordance with their contributions
@stoutde @neimhaille Hi would you mind continuing this discussion without me from here?
@AusAndgie7 @hitinman 😨
@misterdevans In this case  layering thought to be sand deposited by wind  not water
At the AstroLight Festival @astrofestVIC at @scienceworks_mv tonight! Big crowds  lots of science! #astrolight16
@mcnees I. What?
@PlanetDr @alexwitze Entirely possible!
@JohnRSports @PlanetDr @upulie IKR?
@alexwitze By my definition of substantial  a handful of grains doesn't count
@alexwitze Depends how you define substantial....
The @OSIRISREx mission will be the first to return a substantial amount of material from another world since Apollo. #OSIRISREx
Just over half an hour till @OSIRISREx launches! https://t.co/H47JW4EBB7
In less than 9 hours  @OSIRISREx blasts off on its mission to asteroid #Bennu! https://t.co/HAD3q3GTRA Unfortunately no passengers allowed
@UnoTejano Lots of things! Is there a specific thing you're curious about?
@UnoTejano What question?
#Melbourne tweeps! Come to @scienceworks_mv Saturday night for @astrofestVIC &amp; hear me talk #DarkMatter! https://t.co/UmB1c7ymzV
@mcnees Bob many people are saying
@agtmadcat Oh  hm. I'm not sure where to find that exactly. I'd probably just have to search around  I'm afraid...
@agtmadcat Maps of our galaxy or other galaxies?
@mistersaxon @OSIRISREx No  it'll be a really tiny sample. Asteroid is about 500m across.
The asteroid @OSIRISREx will sample  Bennu  has a v small chance of hitting Earth in late 2100s.  Just like humans to throw the first punch.
Tomorrow this rocket will take @OSIRISREx into space to chase down an asteroid &amp; steal a bit of it. (launch~7pm EDT) https://t.co/agIsTunTk0
@DrRubidium @GertyZ I refuse to believe the entire existence of the article isn't satire
@kevinschawinski @ProfBrianCox @EricIdle @onitek @neiltyson @heathercampbell I'd be happy with a few rows back on that one actually
@Tweitzel Thank you!
Hey look it's video of me on @BreakfastNews talking about rocket explosions and missions to space rocks https://t.co/ONoyEwxo5r
@physicsmatt I've been doing a bit of that this year
@Tweitzel It's on the right hand side of the page
@MisfitDeveloper Hm good question. I'd say yes but for this question I'm more interested in specific crowd-funding campaigns
@starstryder @DrMRFrancis My biggest google conflicts are a singer-songwriter  a cricketer  &amp; an…online performer…who goes by AstroKatie
@verbiscer IT'S SO FRICKIN' EXCITING!
@mhultstrom I hear that is what they look for! :)
@verbiscer *waves hello*
@mhultstrom Someone's gotta hire me into a tenure-track job first!
@mhultstrom Oh
@mhultstrom Also I don't have a tenure board; I'm a postdoc
@mhultstrom I didn't say that. I was just commenting that I wish I could do everything
@mhultstrom What negativity?
@mggtTaylor Just don't accidentally get them confused and resurrect aliens on the comet because that could make things messy
@mggtTaylor @Philae2014 @ESA_Rosetta @TheRealGZA @Rosetta_OSIRIS OMG
@kejames I dunno. I don't think there's more they can do than image Philae though. @mggtTaylor might be able to say more...
@d612539 @CosmicRami @astroduff @BreakfastNews I like it!
@DRG_physics @ebpetroff Well there are degrees of mysteriousness
@PooleAvery @BreakfastNews @uommedia @unimelb Thanks so much!
@MisfitDeveloper Awesome thank you! :)
Was a pleasure filling in for @astroduff on @BreakfastNews today! Talked rockets &amp; space rocks. Thx @d612539 for pic https://t.co/eMyTHWteuF
Getting ready to go on @BreakfastNews and talk SPAAAAAACE! (They did my hair &amp; makeup &amp; now I feel weird.) https://t.co/QwDCutOcVC
@ProfMike_M What was the mistake? I missed it
@grb090423 That's the south pole
@SanMedra Totally
@mggtTaylor @ESA_Rosetta 😥
@Mark_HFX Yeah  it rotates about every 12 hours
@Mad_Science_Guy Yeah definitely
@ProfMike_M See next tweet! :)
@markmccaughrean @Rosetta_OSIRIS @ESA_Rosetta 😍
@JPMajor "Someone made this video..." 😐
@markmccaughrean @Rosetta_OSIRIS @ESA_Rosetta Gah I can't handle how awesome this is
@MisfitDeveloper Yeah
@DrMRFrancis These are the best
@AndrewJYoungs I’d love to do it but I don’t know if I can take on any new projects of that magnitude right at the moment!
@RiAus @theotherdrsmith Everybody likes cosmic disaster shows  right?
@voidshaper It wouldn’t look like anything because the bubble of true vacuum would expand at the speed of light. But way more destructive
@tauriqmoosa @DrMRFrancis Tauriq how long have you known us
@theotherdrsmith Do you mean @RiAus or @ScienceChannel? Do you think it would need a content advisory?
@voidshaper Vacuum decay has a special place in my heart
@poloniumman @EngineeringCHS I heard about the student experiments. So sad. :(
@AscendingNode Yikes! Lucky escape!
@AusAndgie7 I've been there!
@Summer_Ash @kejames If I'm not in bed when America gets up  I know I've done something wrong
@kejames @Summer_Ash Something similar happened to me except I over-stayed-awake and also rocket
@Space_Station @mikamckinnon @Astro_Kate7 @NASA_Astronauts Is there a particular reason for using hashtag instead of handle?
@CNN You can call him a rapist  CNN. His extracurriculars aren't really the important thing here.
@FakeDanTosello @TrueSciPhi Ha awesome :)
@FakeDanTosello @TrueSciPhi Wait really?
@LeeBillings @lorengrush @mirikramer I just got excited at idea origin had been nailed down. Because mystery! Even if definitely not aliens.
@LeeBillings @mirikramer @lorengrush Ain't that always the way
@LeeBillings @lorengrush @mirikramer Yesterday's statement to me read as "we think likely terrestrial but don't know for sure"
@LeeBillings @lorengrush @mirikramer I guess I'll have to wait till on computer to know what that site says. Prev statement was inconclusive
@LeeBillings @lorengrush @mirikramer Page won't load for me 😬
@LeeBillings @mirikramer I mean I haven't seen confirmation of the signal's origin -- do those docs have it?
@LeeBillings @mirikramer I haven't seen this -- is it posted somewhere?
@TrueSciPhi August  hey.
@GregoryWeinkauf PLEASE SHIP ASAP
@AtyHans Yes! Slide rules and room-sized computers and unaided human brilliance got us as far as we've ever been. Really awesome stuff.
@AtyHans It's so much fun to read about how they did stuff like this. The whole Moon program was seat-of-the-pants stuff  but it worked
@Fliipp_ @AtyHans https://t.co/BBqyBYZXsD &lt;- Google is an amazing thing
@emoontx That's just a trick of light on a crater
@Paladin1969 Thanks man. It's not so bad really. Been a while since horrible people came after me en masse!
@tabinfl Yeah we're trained to look for the least interesting explanations first
@mcnees Really? Which one?
@mcnees I wonder how they choose
@LoriKFenton Hm I haven't read the paper and unclear from the summary; maybe @martinselvis2 could answer?
@mirikramer It *could* be something interesting! Like...microlensing! Or aliens I guess maybe
@mirikramer Aw :(
@mcnees Wow  yeah
@michelle_lmc :( I'm glad you got away OK
@michelle_lmc Ugh that's awful
@nadiamdrake @suthers @SETIEric Thing I'm advocating: observational follow-up  sensible reporting that makes VERY CLEAR it prob isn't aliens
@nadiamdrake @suthers @SETIEric Definitely good to go look at it  more data certainly needed. Not sure massive media storm helpful though.
@suthers @SETIEric Yeah I see why the media is covering it I guess but it's still odd that such an unlikely-to-be-real thing got singled out
@nadiamdrake @arielwaldman Yeah stuff I read says people are actively searching now  just hasn't been fully examined yet
@hugorealtor It's just a matter of getting the training really
@dbastian2 @b0yle If you look at the astronomers  we're all pointing in the direction of "don't call it aliens"
@jlacroix93 @mcnees Oh don't worry we will tweet about it when it's done  you can be sure of that!
I'm working on a little calculation with @mcnees and it's so much fun and it's going to be amazing  just FYI. #TwitterScience
@mcnees Maybe the coffee will finally do it
@mcnees But we figured it out decades ago  just didn't figure out how to get people to care 😞
@upulie @SwiftOnSecurity OMG everything on the internet is lies
"Habitable" &amp; "terrestrial" already ambiguous; we should save "Earth-like" for when we really know https://t.co/akfxFexoir by @mirikramer
@dog_rates @darth OK I give tentative approval to this plan  pls let me do the petting I mean judging  PS yes they are indeed mighty nerds
@dog_rates @darth What if they are all good dogs tho
@dog_rates @darth I have seen the dog award shows they are very body shaming and I do not approve
@twiddlekins @upulie @AdamRutherford How did it get in my hair?
@upulie @BespokeCheese I use a block bot it makes Twitter possible
@upulie omg
@upulie 😍
@upulie I think they have set
Spent the day sciencing with @upulie &amp; we were very productive &amp; definitely didn't spend our time tweeting at each other across the table
@FlyOpineMonkey @upulie There is no basking only science also Upulie knows me too well and is kind enough to tolerate anyway
@FiveFrogsBlog @upulie Already posted one!
@upulie To be fair the pie was really quite nice.
@upulie It would be the best life
@upulie We can make a fortification  stop them at the stairs. We have wifi and power they will be helpless to stop us
@upulie But it's so nice here
@mcnees @upulie JPL!
@elakdawalla @upulie All NASA all the time
Hanging out with @upulie  with her fab new NASA jacket https://t.co/T3AhZI5CJL
@haywal83 Hey you don't need to tag me in this conversation
@algi80 The latter. Traversable.
@physicsjackson I'll be careful! Congrats on new job by the way!
@CorvusTheYoung @EverFlores07 @mcnees Fortunately this is already a thing I actively avoid! All the best to you &amp; good luck in your studies.
@CorvusTheYoung @EverFlores07 @mcnees There are so many sentences! First sentence of page 91 also v good
@SteveShawCA We don't have access to it and also it might not exist
@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride See whereas I don't like idea of policing thought crime. Bc we can't know thoughts/beliefs. Only impact.
@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride I.e.  by your argument  a joke can only be bad if the person believes it. Otherwise all good.
@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride Ohhhh you're only concerned about thought crime. OK. Makes sense now.
@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride I no longer have any idea what argument you're making  if any  so I'll leave you to it! All the best
@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride @jinxeptor Dude context is what we're talking about. The context of the society &amp; the joke's impact on it
@EverFlores07 @docfreeride @jinxeptor @mcnees Honestly I don't care at all whether or not you're sexist. It has nothing to do with the issue
@EverFlores07 @docfreeride @jinxeptor This is an excellent illustration of the concepts described in the expert thread @mcnees shared!
@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride Why not?
@EverFlores07 @docfreeride @mcnees @jinxeptor Depends on joke  but essentially  yeah
@EverFlores07 @docfreeride @mcnees @jinxeptor Doesn't matter whose opinion it is. What matters is impact. Stuff like this says sexism OK.
@OldLadyCart Moon is always rotating!
@EverFlores07 @mcnees Which is to say  jokes are not some kind of magic get-out-of-harm-free card. They can themselves do harm.
@EverFlores07 @mcnees "dispar- agement humor communicates message of tacit approval or tolerance of discrimination" https://t.co/MMEzsrvyez
@John1ODea I have no idea. Maybe @AusAndgie7 could tell you?
@momdude56 @tamarakrinsky You mean this? https://t.co/aAivYBeb1Q :)
@WoodLloydWood @drspacejunk @timeshighered 😥
@paulsanderson Thanks!
@PeterDEdmonds Thanks Peter!
@mikeynerd According to some estimates  stars in our galaxy might on average have about 1 rocky planet per habitable zone!
@GregoryWeinkauf Thanks! :)
@poloniumman That would be one of the big challenges!
@Antiproton_com Likely
@michael_w_busch @AllPlanets @exploreplanets Yeah my understanding is they've been searched for to no avail
An introduction to our neighbor planet  Proxima b  by @AllPlanets https://t.co/yUvdTfYM9q at @exploreplanets https://t.co/EktQwbkz50
@MisfitDeveloper @thephysicsgirl You should check out @PintInTheSky!
@mblackmn Are you familiar with @the_ephemerides ? You might enjoy that one too!
@mcnees Maybe data needed something else to be the plural of since no one ever seems to use datum anymore :(
@markmccaughrean @MerrickPhillip Oh gosh  I was hoping I was exaggerating a bit more than that!
@AstroPJJ I haven't figured this part out yet
@markmccaughrean @MerrickPhillip I'd be surprised if a day went by when you didn't!
@Summer_Ash @NASASunEarth 📡🛰😎
@markmccaughrean @MerrickPhillip I issued a correction already
@MerrickPhillip Ohhhh hm probably the former
@DattaguruP 1 pixel = 11cm
@DattaguruP I blew up the pic and counted pixels
You can watch Deep Space Network signals come in on your Twitter feed too if you like: @dsn_status (HT @voidshaper @elakdawalla)
@DarryWillis It is!
@voidshaper Oh gosh that's a high-volume feed. Super cool though!
@mggtTaylor Dude STEREO-B hasn't been using the DSN for almost 2 years; it can have a turn! :P
@JeremyCaron Oh absolutely. But a lot of time on Twitter does have real value
@cirriculumvitae It's a theorem that's been around a while. Basically BHs are pure spacetime objects  no real substance to them.
@EdDarrell Dude when I say "all the best to you" that's a sign-off  not a "please keep me in this conversation" cue
@OuttasightPV Doesn't require any atoms of anything in vicinity
@OuttasightPV They radiate a spectrum. But it doesn't really happen through the particle/antiparticle thing. More complicated.
@OuttasightPV @thisoldgov @sandarcon Scenario like that doesn't work. Would increase mass of BH  not decrease it.
@voidshaper Technically even the big ones can make Hawking radiation  it's just super dim &amp; likely lost in glow from stuff falling in
@voidshaper Basically. And we don't know if they exist. Could potentially make little ones with high-energy particle collisions too.
@OuttasightPV @thisoldgov @sandarcon You're thinking of a popular explanation  involving virtual particles  but it's bit more subtle really
@voidshaper Not that I know of
@mcnees No that's the star; the world is in the other direction
@mcnees Oh dear god what have you done
@dcastelvecchi @physicsmatt So it turns out @minutephysics did this in detail  got different answer https://t.co/eQDThzTZmQ
@haywal83 Not a chance
@GeorgeTakei Thanks for the FB shout-out :)
@asymbina @GlennF @doctorow All right  have purchased. (Yay for immediate electronic access to books!)
@FernRoyal I saw the FB post! Whole thing is unreal
@pestanabjj Supermassive black hole pulling in gas/dust at center of a galaxy  resulting in glowing hot disk of material falling in.
@BeckePhysics @StartsWithABang As far as we can tell  expansion totally same in all directions. Different in time of course.
@BeckePhysics It's not a privileged/"absolute" reference frame but it's a frame we can define. See last bit of this https://t.co/ruJuJCfM7l
@TrueSciPhi Oh that's lovely
@Astrophiz Dunno  send me an e-mail with more info?
@mggtTaylor OK I guess that’s also a good cause. :)
@mggtTaylor You should totally apply anyway  since you’ll have all that free time after Rosetta’s… um… event.
@mggtTaylor Nah dude  YOU rock. In a cometary ice &amp; rubble kind of way. (Thank you!)
@mikeynerd It is a drawing of me! https://t.co/5NGSDf64gU
@CyborgN8VMari Thanks!
@CitizenFour5 I'm not really into having hate-followers. All the best to you.

@cirriculumvitae See this for context: https://t.co/NqXd2Z1fhX
@PrinceDignity I'm a research fellow in theoretical cosmology
@TeamGleason it was an honor. I'm very inspired by your strength  courage  positive attitude and family. Thank you!
@vr_doug A thousand thanks to the VR Lab. Without people like you  human space flight would be a much riskier business.
@spacechelle same as Julie's. drop me a note
@spacechelle Same. Hope we meet up!
@TaraKaliszewski @Astro_Clay it worked for me...but with the reintroduction to gravity I can relate!

@drmlb not enough! :)
@marcozambi hey Marco! Thanks and say hello to everyone in Lecco for me. Had a great time when I was there.
@dittmarml is that great or what! (going to miss it....)
@dittmarml yep! Although the cameras can never do the view justice - but this is pretty cool stuff.
@dittmarml view looks like that from the ET camera but moving a lot slower! Not for long..
@schierholz yes I was able to watch. I hope to catch both games tomorrow too. We are up at 5:30am as part of our sleep shift.
@NEVIE_JOHN Multi-purpose Logistics Module. It is the cargo carrier we are taking with us in the payload bay.
@Astro_Nicole yep. Nicole I had  ducks and a turtle crossing the road event on my way home last night. The wilds of Houston..
@NEVIE_JOHN just for the contingency for rescue. One person returns every 3 months so for 4 it takes a year.
@NEVIE_JOHN extravehicular activity (space walking)

@RealEvilBoo My astro class is the Penguins - bad joke about birds who cannot fly - and obviously not true since I am here!
@RealEvilBoo Astro_Penguin - You know it's a myth penguins can't fly? Twas a great day in space! Living the Dream!!
@govi47 Viviana - Like with most groups  we have a mix of personal beliefs.
@PC0101 PC - I was one of John's Boy Scout leaders. When off to college and life  you lose track. Esp at 5mps! Strange world!!
@PC0101 Thanks  Peter! I knew there were no "do overs" so praying I was lucky enough to get a good one!!
@cmchmurphy @amikokauderer Thanks  Miller! Just trying to share the adventure!!
@Astro_Ron Hey  Ron! We're supposed to be asleep right now  but let's run the test. Will @carbon_flight count it as science?
@ageekmom I've never heard the taped narration for SSH tour  but my son who worked as a Tour Guide at Space Center Houston said it was weird
@thenasaman Sawyer - I'm just living the dream and happy to share the adventure!
@ageekmom Shannon - Thanks for the RT! Getting short here in Star City!
@spasmunkey Thanks  Liz!
@bethbeck wow- hope there were better pictures than that!
@Carbon_Flight  Thanks  Ed! It was an excellent day!!
@Carbon_Flight Roger all  FLIGHT!
@kulfispace Tahir #Koln and the #EAC team were excellent! I'm in Houston. To Russia in week or so  then Baikonur late May. Close!
Had fun today w @Carbon_Flight talking with @astro_cady  @astro_ron  & @astro_paolo. They are doing awesome! Great way to end JSC training!
@kulfispace Hey  Tahir - great to see you on here! Sorry I missed you in Koln a few weeks ago!!
@AstronautAbby  - You keep up the great work and I'll be ready to turn my job over to you in a few years!
@spasmunkey We look forward to lighting your birthday candle soon!
We met @AstroRobonaut 's cousin. Famous one is ready for launch. RT @a_cup_of_sea:  http://twitpic.com/405334 - Is this the @AstroRobonaut
@Astro_Clay @astro_ron Clay - thanks for your help with the EVA Assessment Team yesterday! You and Zeb had great inputs!
@ageekmom Shannon - a big howdy to you on Twitter  too!
http://twitpic.com/3nwcza /via @bethbeck Very cool! Glad they got the flag patches fixed!
@bethbeck I understand your pain  but welcome aboard!
@PC0101 Sure - ground can control Canadarm and does. Crew required for speed or critical actions.
@ASTRO_YYZ "To the stars in 2011!" I'll see you there  Katrina! Make it a great year!!
@NewsFromSpace Thanks! Just reaching my prime! And still living the dream!!
@PC0101 They nap a lot. And I would say they could use a little extra sleep right now! There's definitely more room in 0-g  too.
@PC0101 Astro_Clay is cheap!
@Astro_Clay Husker Boy - I have a 50 ruble note coming your way soon!
@SpaceKate @astro_paolo Absolutely!
@PC0101 Launch pads are popular gathering places! Even one as remote as this!!
@aggieastronaut @astro_clay Make fun of my Husker Boy bro? No fun in that this year!

@Astro_Clay @Tungsten_Flight Thank you  @Astro_Clay
Thk u!Here’s the patch  if you haven’t seen. RT @space_mace: @Carbon_Flight @NASA @NASA_Johnson @Astro_TJ Nice patch https://t.co/tVeXnP7feQ
Made me smile hugely  @Carbon_Flight !!!   Best response I can give is from my Army heart:   HUA! https://t.co/SyGwTLxAWo
Thanks  @Carbon_Flight !! https://t.co/xnGcLxfvk4
@Ian_Benecken yes  yes it was indeed. Good eyes!
@edvancise @spacechelle  I think you have a solid idea there! Although  I've always been partial to rockhoppers and chinstraps
Psst! Dude  @Astro_Wheels :   Don't look now  but...you're in your undies! https://t.co/YJPlHvv6SS
@Carbon_Flight am reading too!
THIS is cool! RT @ecohair:How will aerodynamic forces affect @NASA_SLS during launch?Simulations help us understand: https://t.co/1QA3RSsqjk
@spacechelle @KWSMTeam is true. Just search on ‘first live tweet from space’ https://t.co/6oeDy6IrOq  Jan 2010. Thx @spacechelle !
@answerpc So  in your vacuum  place a body/mass. Can it not absorb heat or radiate it?
@answerpc why do you think there is no temp in a vacuum? Also  what 3 ways is heat conveyed/transmitted?
@RegLevy @NASA_Marshall More to come;  more to share!  I promise!
@spacechelle @Astro_Clay @Astro_Tani Well  when a freezer comes up 'empty'  it often comes up with cold yummy consumables in it :-)
@Carbon_Flight My how time flies!  Unless you are going REALLY fast  then it slows down!
Welcome to the Twitterverse  NASA Deputy Administrator   @DavaExplorer !!
That’s right  @Carbon_Flight   I never would I mislead you.  Nope  never.  But pictures ARE required!! :-) #honestcrossmyheart
@spacechelle CUTE!
@HBSastrowardoyo Not really. My training flow was wonderful. No regrets. I went Soyuz  because of the timing &amp; international agreements.
@Joseflor238 no. Time is not an absolute  by any means.
@crpokhrel and to you too.
@NASAhistory You made me smile HUGELY!  Thank you for thinking of me!!!
@spacechelle  :-)   ALL THE TIME!
@ISS_CASIS @NASA_Marshall Awwww!!  Thanks for using my E23 aurora pic as your prime pic!  Made me warmly smile!
@spacechelle :-)  Nope!  And that is SUCH a serious oversight  and missed market-niche opportunity!
@PC0101 LOL!!! Well said  Peter!!!
@I_We_Gaia Indeed  AND behind secured doors too!!!
@spacechelle YES!  And the little eggs have tasty jelly bean candies in them!!! :-)
@Astro_Clay @Astro_Wheels @MDBenson @megan_daughtry It is a matter of definition.At present Pluto doesn’t meet the definition of a planet.
@spacechelle AWESOME smile-bringing pic!
@spacechelle :-)  Laugher is absolutely the best!  :-)
@Carbon_Flight LOLLL!!!! That one was good! Now explaining to the authorities I’m really ok  honest! #wipingtearsoflaughterfrommyeyes
@Carbon_Flight  LOL!!!!   Now at dinner  and I have to explain to folks in the restaurant why it is I'm laughing out loud...!!
@RocketCtrGuide :-) thanks for sharing!  Made me smile!  GLAD you liked the surprise visit. Hope it made you smile/laugh too!
@Pillownaut :-) Thank you for remembering!
@NewsFromSpace :-) thank you for remembering! :-)
@spacechelle :-))))))))  THANK YOU  for the bday wishes!
@spasmunkey THANK YOU  for the bday wishes!
@Astro_Clay @Spunkyy1993 Clay is special  a classmate of mine.  But he is NOT the only astro who responds.  Just sayin'....
@DaniAngione I like it!  In essence  yes.
@Carbon_Flight LOL!!!  :-)
@spacechelle @xpusser   WHAAAT?!!!!   Harumph!!!!!
@spasmunkey Glad!  I'll pass the kind words on....
@spacechelle :-)  I did!  I did indeed! RTR!
@spacechelle Yes yes  minor league  but still  lights  diamond  grass  pop of the ball in glove  crack of the bat ... you know...
@Space_Lectures Probably the best guidance I have for you regarding "Appearances" is here: http://t.co/UTpQ2yUR5X   Hope that helps.
@Space_Lectures would LOVE to!! Perhaps an opportunity might present itself.
@Space_Lectures Glad you enjoyed the whole evening!!
@rodmoose You mean "Rocket Science is out".... OF THIS WORLD!    Yes?!
@ageekmom Thanks 4 remembering;truth be told many folks 4 nearly a decade had been working to make it happen! Just was in right place/time.
@ageekmom :-)
@l_krishnan You are most welcome.  Thanks for following us and our mission.
@thenasaman :)  thx! :)  Good meeting ya  Sawyer!
@rttilghman Glad you liked the twitter present! :)
@thenasaman Soooo awesome that Grandpa got to see the ISS.  Wonders never cease!  Good hunting!
@davidhitt THANK YOU for that.  Means a lot to me.  Wanted it to be special.
@ageekmom :) You should check the histories of BMUG;  I was one of the sysadmins over there :)
@cleytonkaio :) well then... a HAPPY early birthday to you!  I hope that this year treats you wonderfully and more safely than ever!
@thenasaman Took about 2 days for muscle memory 2 restore. Balance was pretty good by 3-4 days  catching balls was about 5 days.
@thenasaman Shuttle has a defined stay time  so they cram in LOTS!  & after they leave  we have SO MUCH to put away  & organize.
@johnnie50 Nice pic
@mars_stu Not much astro observations on this mission. Most of our visual external observation is on the Earth and atmosphere this time.
@DrSamStrauss Thanks BUNCHES  Sam! Made me smile!
@ageekmom :) & thk u for holding your breath for so long!  Now  BREATHE again... :)
@Darwin1800 We have many cameras onboard. During our day  you can see us on the NASA channel  & VERY soon on the web (early Feb??).
@ageekmom Thx bunches again.  Shall I/Should I RT your tweet ??
@ageekmom Thx for sharing that link.  Nice collection of pics of our crew & activities!
@thenasaman :) thx for the encouraging words.  Will endeavor to keep tweeting.  HOPING to post some pix here soon of the past few days...
@ageekmom Thx 4 the well-wishes.  I do so hope and plan to ENJOY! :)
@ageekmom For a while we have been discussing e-book readers.  There are PDAs onboard that can act like that  but not one of the tailormades
@thenasaman Not yet in space  so can't answer yet that part.  But have not been out at night because it's COLD. Plus have had clouds.
@ageekmom Paper books are an upload mass/volume issue.
@ageekmom Tried to tweet-in to the tweetup.
@spasmunkey Great! Can't wait to see pix from the tweetup.
@ageekmom Is true: Oleg had family but both Soichi's & mine are still in the US  due to academic finals/school rqmnts.They will arrive Tues.
@ageekmom Both family will be there  and my best friend(s) will be at launch. Thk u for asking.
@ageekmom VERY good fit check - good to see just how tight it really is.  All systems look good. Thx for asking!
Thanks to @ageekmom  and  @lucied_inthesky for those 2 URLs.
@ageekmom Thank you for the FB link. I KNEW of this  just hadn't been there yet.  Will RT it shortly. Thk u!
@ageekmom Glad you like; and glad you are following!  thk u for sharing with me the adventure  excitement  & focus.
@bethbeck :) Making history with a snowball.... not sure that's a good thing though :)
@thenasaman If know far enough in adv  we can change our orbital altitude; if not  then sheltering in OUR Soyuz.
@ageekmom "Last time b4 launch..." -- a little bit of that  da. Not sadly so  but "different".
@ageekmom Egak!I missed the 'boarding' question.Let me delay answering til we do our fit-chks early on in Baikonur. I can describe btr then.
@ageekmom Thk u.  Is going fine... having to focus a bit more to get "chores" done.
@bethbeck Snowball -- now wouldn't THAT be a surprise to see coming at the on-board crew as the hatch opened??? :)
@bethbeck The occasion was the traditional trip in to Red Square to lay flowers at the grave of Yuri Gagarin.
@spasmunkey Final reviews for some systems and for "rescue" equipment; also final fitchecks in Sokols in the Soyuz.
@spasmunkey Thank you bunches!  And  me too!  Looking fwd to HRF!
@thenasaman It is my HOPE  & my PLAN to answer Twitter questions from orbit; THAT live-time technology should be in place w/in days.
@ageekmom on Earth  the carbonation knows which way is up (burping); in orbit  not. And bubbles "hurt".
@ageekmom I KNOW I will miss "bubbly water" -- I like sparkling water a lot!  That  and breezes... pretty sure.
@thenasaman RE: interest in space program: the Russians don't differ much frm US interest. There's national pride  & wonderful engineers  2!
@bethbeck Thanks much! Keep your fingers crossed!
@thenasaman :) You are interested!  Why wouldn't I?
@bethbeck THANK YOU very much!  Glad u enjoyed!
@thenasaman GLAD that I can!  Thx for following!
@ageekmom thx!
@ageekmom uh oh... is that good? :)  btw  WHICH tweet????
@ageekmom Da  will be tweeting all along  even from Station  & upon return too.
@ageekmom :) thx.  I'm at 830 now.... let's see what happens. :)
@ageekmom ginger bone structure;  darting back and forth is likely to be an issue with joints  ankles. Will see what bonemass is when rtn.
@ageekmom I probably won't be able to play competative tennis again for ~6months or more. But I'll get there!
@ageekmom duration of rehab varies in stages -- but full rehab is about a 1:1 month ratio of being in orbit.Can drive in a week or so.
@ageekmom GOOD idea on the tweetup.   We'll see how things are proceeding post rehab  and where the opportunities are best.
@ageekmom Been in Russia since 7 Nov  for the duration. Going to Baikonur on 8 Dec.
@ageekmom :) :)  made me smile!  Will see if we can't make a tweetup happen once back  AFTER re-hab!  Thx for suggesting.
@ageekmom Awwww.... THANK YOU for sharing that with me! &lt;&lt;HUGE SMILE&gt;&gt;
@ageekmom Thx.  You too.  Rest well.
@ageekmom Made me smile HUGELY!  Is my honor -- thx for following.  I hope to share & entertain... let me know how I do  ask questions too.
@ageekmom BTW  you are correct.  Am a FE for E22/23  and I did indeed train with E21 folks a bit.
@UniphiSpaceAge Thank you for remembering.
@CommanderMLA "Wilbur!!"
@HBSastrowardoyo @MyCentralJersey Thanks. Hope to be home sometime this summer. My kids need to see their grandmother!

@chitownchica You're very welcome  Sophia.
Just saw great story on @CBSNews about #NewHorizons w/@AlanStern .  Great media coverage!
@Louiestowell @NASAWatch I obviously agree. :-)  What's important now (IMHO) is to keep building and growing from this.
@spacechelle @SNCspacesystems @astrosociety I'll second that thought!
@spacechelle @Astro_Clay @Astro_Pam @DARPA That would b great  but would love my daughter to do that! #STEM #girlsinSTEM
@chitownchica Spoke to tie in from scouting days to working as an astronaut. Also spoke of importance of #ISS research. Then Q&amp;A. Was fun!
@MatthewSievert History is filled with examples where greatness was preceded by countless setbacks. Keep the faith!
Thanks @ISS_CASIS @PathwayBSA @Scouting2060 for a great morning w/incredible young men and women. You made my day! http://t.co/wXiXi1dvmB

@UniphiSpaceAge Absolutely agree. Known Bob since '92. Flown with him in T-38 and Shuttle Training Aircraft. A class act! Well deserved Bob!
@HeidiLEdwards1 @spacechelle I absolutely agree.  Our home planet is so beautiful as seen from space  yet so fragile  and it's all we have!
@Space_Lectures I hope so too! ;-)
@HBSastrowardoyo Thank you.  Nice to be back.  I do usually make it back to NJ a few times a year for family/friends.

@AmandaGTeach good guess. There are Caribou here  but that was a muskox skull.
Same curiosity that excites me about #PlutoFlyby drives me 2 explore places like #Tunnunik crater. @csa_asc @drcrater http://t.co/2Ls7Qpg7Tj
@CommandrNickel you nailed it! Muskox.
@Astro_Jeremy: One of nicest shatter cones I've seen in #Tunnunik crater. Almost a perfect cone. @drcrater http://t.co/b7naOEN39t
@CommandrNickel continue 2 refine expeditionary mindset  learn more about being a field geologist 4 future missions &amp; challenge myself.
Great day exploring canyon in #Tunninik crater!Rocks in background used 2 lie flat prior 2 chaos of impact.@drcrater http://t.co/8IeNN8RWb8
Looks like wolf explored crater canyon as well. Hopefully we fare better than this muskox did. #Tunnunik @drcrater http://t.co/3dtTYNZKNp
We made it 2 #Tunnunik crater! Camp is near canyon which will give insight into what lies beneath surface.@drcrater http://t.co/JHKWx31jSY

@irishspaceblog @ReefBase It is incredible down here! Such a privilege to explore new places!
@BrynLaidlaw True!
@joannekarma Sure can. Slept through the night during half the decompression.  Good way to pass the time. Would rather dive outside though.
@joannekarma True  but one constant I believe... no matter where we explore  Space or elsewhere  there will be something that amazes.
@CommandrNickel Flooding and Fire are the real killers for us down here.
@kitandfrank @SkyNews Thanks for dropping a note! Great to hear from folks on other side of this ocean!

@Astro_Sabot @Aki_Hoshide @Thom_astro @Astro_Jeanette congrats on a great @NASA_NEEMO mission!! Safe trip back to the surface
@Thom_astro glad you got a night dive in!  I'm really hoping that works out for us as well. Best time to see the ocean really alive!
@Thom_astro we can all read between the lines how much you miss @Astro_Andreas . But this time will pass!
@Thom_astro what is the coolest part of NEEMO so far?

@datachick I checked with my ESA buddy and he confirmed it is ATV. ATV of course can be configured many different ways.
@datachick I think your last photo was worse. Been a while since I saw that panel but I think that is ATV. Correct?
@datachick now that would be a very bad day in Space wouldn't it?
@omaflinger I will. Have a great launch experience. Fantastic mission!
@ASTRO_YYZ Star City is great. A truly awesome experience. No  he is not hard on me at all. A great mentor. Cheers on my last day here.

@LiNa8294 Very true! It's like a dart.
@DiegoU All the pleasure was mine. It's a great simulation you set up for the participants! Teamwork  strategic decision-making  had it all!
@Cmdr_Hadfield @CommanderMLA Merci - from sunny Houston
@dallascampbell That was the Soyuz ride of @astro_reid @Astro_Alex et @Msuraev !
@CommanderMLA @Cmdr_Hadfield Bonjour Mike! Non  je ne connais pas l'auteur de la photo  malheureusement...
@Dave_Wilhelm Several thousand degrees!
@jaylupold @CSA_MRichard @Cmdr_Hadfield Even for a doctor  saving a life is a rare privilege. Everyone can and should learn First Aid!
@Astro_Wheels And you are a great mentor to learn the tricky Art of Spacewalking from!

At NBL today with @astro_wheels preparing for a practice of the upcoming July Spacewalk! http://t.co/3SM2vh4zz5
Spent the day underwater with @Astro_Wheels practicing Spacewalk to be done this summer by Astronauts Chris Cassidy and @astro_luca.
@SpaceGirlWendy @barryfawbear @astro_timpeake @nasa_neemo Look out the window at the dazzling beauty of the reef!
@libbydoodle Yes! @astro_wheels and I are helping design the Spacewalks to be performed in July by Chris Cassidy and @astro_luca!
@Cmdr_Hadfield now setting up @AstroRobonaut for some tests. The seventh crewmember onboard? http://t.co/gqXUCr1p4B
@AerospaceDr That's true  especially during practice in the pool. It's easier to use in space.
@Astro_yyz @astro_jeremy That's our dream too! Still lots of training &amp; hard work before walking in the footsteps of @Cmdr_Hadfield ;)
@Astro_yyz @timmermansr @esa_caves Yes  those videos bring back great memories for me!
@LaurenAlloyce @tungsten_flight I'm in good company indeed!
In MCC today with @Tungsten_Flight - check out his awesome cowboy boots  with NASA Flight Director's emblem! http://t.co/6evD8Rvy
@spacechelle You're right  they are very good - and creative at inventing tricky malfunctions!
@omaflinger Good for you! I've not had the chance to meet him yet. Legendary man!
@Astro_yyz I like the the idea!
@Astro_yyz True  nature and climate in Russia and Canada are similar. Somehow  coming from Houston this feels a bit like home ;)
@Astro_yyz Yes  @cmdr_hadfield and his crewmates will be under quarantine until the prime crew launches. Exciting times indeed!
@ASTRO_YYZ It's really an amazing experience to live under water!

@Lindyloo1979 well Linda  my wife- but I can't fit her in a can  so all the food is good enough for me-I might miss salsa though :(
@Space_Station - I sure loved that toothbrush  &amp; @Carbon_Flight did a great job leading the team that fixed the ISS with it!
@ShuttleAlmanac Nope - we have very stict rules of what we can take - so we try to follow them exactly &amp; honor the privilege.
@amisenquiz @esa @esa_eac Absolutely Ami - it’s almost hard to believe how pretty everything is - such history…
Lucky to have my hottie wife for a Germany weekend--Castles  cathedrals  &amp; countryside--What a great place! @ESA_EAC https://t.co/pXk7lN3RoC

@JerryHume @MyNews13 Oh yeah - definitely deserves a fist bump - thanks Jerry!
@DiegoU Thanks Diego!
@Carbon_Flight Oh lord  I hope not - but I want you on console if we have to do one &amp; @Astro_Suni or @Aki_Hoshide as the Ground IV!
@Astro_Clay Thanks Clay!  I hope everything is going well for you and the book.
@AstronautAbby great meeting you too-keep your passion burning  and there's no limits for you!

@LiNa8294 no  it's from dr. Seuss  my first squadron already had a Fischer  so 1 fish  2fish...
@sharonbrunton nope  still waiting.  Bandit and I are doing well though.
@Carbon_Flight @astro_ricky I think mine is running out of juice...we need to find some more lucky ties!
@i_we_gaia Thanks!
@NASAhistory @astro_kjell Thanks - and Happy Birthday to my classmate @astro_kjell!
@spasmunkey Absolutely Liz - all done now though--back to meetings &amp; an NBL dive next week.
@jmm_1233 Absolutely - I turned out the lights in the control room to get a better view &amp; it is wicked cool!
@PC0101 Can't wait for that step Peter!
@spasmunkey You're a skilled pumpkin maker my friend - nicely done!!
@irishspaceblog @ESA_CAVES I think the "ization" part would have to involve Guiness for it to be an Irish word... :)
@AstroAcaba @Astro_Kate7 @ReefBase @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas and @Astro_Soichi -- I think I have them all now...
@AstroAcaba @Astro_Kate7 @ReefBase Whoops - I forgot @Thom_astro and @Astro_Andreas who are also exploring the deep--Have fun guys!!
@ESA_CAVES @irishspaceblog I think it's French word  or maybe Italian?
@psutympany That sounds great-I'm ecstatic that you are finding good info to inspire your kids &amp; I hope we can continue to give you material
@Carbon_Flight No - gotta save that for the special occasions on console with you!
@grb090423 @ESA_CAVES It will be awesome! We will have amazing instructors to keep us out of trouble--I can't wait to explore and learn!
@irishspaceblog @ESA_CAVES Can't wait for the cavenautization!!  Should be a blast!
@irishspaceblog Sorry I'm so slow on twitter  but you're more than welcome - thanks for your support of the space program!
@EricMolloy Thanks Eric  I sure love that little beagle  Bandit's 95% pure love and 5% cayenne pepper!
@psutympany You bet I am  that's way cool you listen - do you work at one of the control centers or listen on the internet?
@spasmunkey Thanks  and thanks for the great training this week!
@sharonbrunton You too Sharon - hope you have some great weather to celebrate our great nation today!
@sharonbrunton you betSharon- he's a happy little guy!
Sweet pic of @Astro_Cady &amp; @Astro_Wheels checking out our new ride--Orion! http://t.co/9cqngTUJkU
@DSpector1966 unfortunately I don't have an assignment yet.  Oh well  still waiting.
@omaflinger @astron8 @astro It's a multipurpose design that can be used as an airlock  flying spaceship or rover depending on end-cap config
@dillonnf @omaflinger @astron8 @astro absolutely was Nick!
@psutympany absolutely a hoot Tympani!
@AstroTek Thanks James!
@DSpector1966 Nah--it's a multi-purpose design that can be an airlock  flying spaceship  rover  and more--it's a way cool concept.
@SSquire That sounds Awesome!!!
@Carbon_Flight Thanks Ed - it was pretty cool - they have done a great job on it so far.
@EricMolloy Cool picture Eric  and sweet model!
@helenpforrest @astronautabby Wow Helen - that's quite an undertaking - good luck!
@helenpforrest @astronautabby Just followed her - looks like a wonderful recruit - go get 'em Abby!
@omaflinger absolutely did.  You have to take every available opportunity with teenagers 😊
@spasmunkey Thanks Liz!
@sharonbrunton I'm pretty sure Bandit is a fitting name when it comes to mischief...:)
@Ed @usairforce Freedom is paid for by sacrifices of our military men &amp; women...AND their families. Happy 31st to Mac's dad--well done 302nd
@jnmatthew @carbon_flight aw shucks Josh - thanks- you're the man!
@sharonbrunton Just a little guy - 12 weeks old.  We are getting him Friday  so I'll post a picture.
@sharonbrunton might be a typo  but you said the payback was "Hugh"-just adopted a beagle named Hugh-renaming Bandit-but that's really cool!
@sharonbrunton Beagles are great.  They take a lot of work at first  but they're worth every bit of effort &amp; payback with years of love.
@GabriellaRitaT @usairforce Gotta love Chuck!
@Carbon_Flight There was a ton left - you should be good to go!
@normbnyc Now that would be cool!
@EricMolloy Thanks Eric!
@PC0101 Deal- I'll attach the 250mi ones as soon as they let me take some 😉
@normbnyc absolutely!
@Carbon_Flight your wife is better looking than me  best to have her next to you...
@spasmunkey might have to wait a while  but maybe someday...
@Carbon_Flight That's bad board etiquette - oops...
@DavidOverSkies @Carbon_Flight @NASA David  there is a ton of aerospace in FL from the panhandle near Eglin AFB to Cape Canaveral--anywhere
@mwilkinson3 @astron8 @chrisastro nope- @Carbon_Flight was running the show - I'm just the guy talking to the crew.
@DavidOverSkies @markjonesjr Thanks David  I can only hope to someday to even come close to measuring up to such a legend-He will be missed.
@DavidOverSkies @ahpilot @MarkJonesJr very sad - he was a great explorer.
@DavidOverSkies @markjonesjr David  I'm a Lt. Colonel  going up for my Colonel's board early next year.
@markjonesjr Don't know about that - you get about 2lbs of extra personal stuff  so not much room.  I'll definitely take a TPS patch though!
@DavidOverSkies @markjonesjr David  looks like Mark has you covered with his blog posts - FTEs are awesome.
Had a sim today w/@Carbon_Flight &amp; @bearcat_stress to get ready to support the ISS crew on an EVA 30 AUG-can't wait to do this for real! 😜
@markjonesjr I'll check it out  thanks
@RosUNwell It's the real deal Tab - check out @AstroRobonaut &amp; http://t.co/04qyJA2L
@juniperala @astro2fish @astro_clay Nowhere near as cool as your profile picture!
@torrencesalces Not sure Sally - but I'm really glad it was a success.  Next step is to put some seats in there!
@IBhappyhopi @Astro_Clay Absolutely agree - he's a great teacher and a great guy.
@therealdjflux @MCapp22 Very cool!
@GabriellaRitaT @spasmunkey told me about @ISS_ScienceOps where they tweet about science real time--check it out!
@torrencesalces Night launches are always beautiful &amp; Don is always full of fun comments!
@torrencesalces Sally  sorry for the delay and thanks for the tip - I'll check it out.
@torrencesalces Cool Tip Sally - I'll give it a try!
@torrencesalces Thanks for the tip Sally - I will!
@spasmunkey I'm restoring my old vette right now-don't think anyone would pay $250K for it though :(  Thanks for the interesting article!
@bubbaradio Thanks Bubba - you da man!
@amikokauderer Amiko  Tim Peake just got an account-can you hook him up with a shout out from the NASA-Astro account?  @astro_timpeake
@Astro_Clay @chucktheoneduck @Astro_Nicole Amen to that! Our questing spirit has yet to be quenched-there is so much yet to "discover"...
@bubbaradio Absolutely!  Can I be your first guest?
@bubbaradio Thanks again for the mention Bubba - you guys rock!
@therealdjflux Alrighty - I'm sure he'll tweet on Tuesday for the Discovery departure from KSC.  He's a great guy
@amikokauderer Amiko  how do you get the blue seal certification that some astros have on their account?  2🐠
@Ed @schierholz @usairforce Amen to that-the Raptor is an absolute dream to fly-God bless the brave/talented men&women who fly&maintain it!
@ShuttleAlmanac Awesome picture!
@jane_macarthur Awesome Jane- have a great trip!
@therealdjflux Me too!  What a cool place - can you imagine how cool that looked when it hit? (until you were vaporized…)
@H_P_R_U @psyclechick @Astro_Clay That's just not nice :(
@psyclechick @H_P_R_U @Astro_Clay No there's an idea!
@H_P_R_U @astro_clay @psyclechick Nope  not yet.  I'm a big fan of Clay  he's been a great instructor for me since I've been at NASA.
@Astro_Clay @astrodrayer Well duh- gotta build up some brownie points that I can spend in the pool :)  Looking forward to it sir!
@astrodrayer @Astro_Clay Dex and Clay are awesome people too - you know how to pick them!
@SpaceCampUSA She's a grad right?  I'm jealous - and yep - she's a cool lady!
@amikokauderer Thanks - and nice profile picture :)  I'm open to any suggestions you have to do this better.
@schierholz I'll sure try - thanks for following!
@SpaceCampUSA Deal!
@PC0101 Thanks for the advice Peter - I'll take it to heart and do my best.
@SpaceCampUSA I wanted to go to Space Camp SOOOOO bad - but I always had to work the family construction biz :(  What a great pgm you run!
@psyclechick @mgrabois @Astro_Clay @H_P_R_U  Sounds like I have a lot to learn!
@Ed @Omid @AdamS @schierholz Thanks for the welcome Ed!
@Astro_Clay Alright sir  finally pulled the "twigger" - open to any advice you have for doing the twitterverse right.
@Luthien_I Thanks Luthien!
@rbanffy Ricardo  I'm a Mac guy too - but unfortunately we have to work with what's up there :)

@AvpdIsapain I think it's more that he has allowed people that hold these beliefs to feel justified and enabled.
@hugorealtor agree.
@hipquark @quadraticadder but I strongly think that if Clinton was a man  he'd be losing by twice as much

@kejames yes it really is. Cleardarksky is definitely the best bet though - does well for Astro stuff!
@kejames I hope so! (I got burned by https://t.co/ygTK3C5s1O today though. 80% cloud cover when it forecast completely clear :-/ )
@AvpdIsapain @ABC no.
@stoutde @FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @HillaryClinton yep. I want a thinker/life-long learner as President.
@AvpdIsapain usually!
@prgrmr42 yeah but the difference between 25 and 50% is quite a kicker in astronomy

@rdcrisp @valentingye grants often from philanthropic donations. Philanthropy-maybe you should try it for a change instead of abusing others
@valentingye @rdcrisp (I've blocked @rdcrisp because he's abusive and doesn't believe in helping fellow humans in any way)
@stoutde @BrewCityChaser wisdom doesn't come easy..
@Paladin1969 @noctemcyn oh of course! Wonderful and very challenging degree and skill. I think I'd fail that for sure!
@stoutde @BrewCityChaser agreed. My empathy comes from tough life experiences but the tumult didn't always let me focus on what I needed.
@stoutde @BrewCityChaser I'm still recovering from mine. Really has an impact on being able to choose and having good advice
@howagreg @AAASFellowships would love to chat about your experience sometime. I'm a policy nerd.
@howagreg @AAASFellowships oh brilliant! I always wanted to pursue this but wasn't able to after grad school. Maybe I can in future!
@howagreg @AAASFellowships *do
@noctemcyn @Paladin1969 what is an MLIS? (Excuse my ignorance)
@ShoemakerMicah brilliant! Love how the more experience people get  the more get know what they want to do.
@mlmarshall13 @girlyratfish people shouldn't be punished for pursuing  what they are born to do. Definite benefits for society.
@girlyratfish @mlmarshall13 sensible idea too!
@girlyratfish @mlmarshall13 I know. It's appalling that college education is not free. Too much knowledge in world to be equipped with K-12
@ScottWx_TWN @YouTube oh cool! What a great idea
@ScottWx_TWN ooh - I always wish I knew more about meteorology
@GabrielleNYC that's fantastic! Congratulations!
@valeriemichelle @stoutde that's a good point too - good mentors  parents  advice from older generation is so valuable
@GabrielleNYC and be a wonderful student. Every mature student I have met has been top of class
@_TheGeoff yeah that is similar to NZ system
@Quixoticnance @mrkempnz very cool!
@_TheGeoff I didn't mean to suggest standard qualification determine how smart someone is
@_TheGeoff that's a huge problem. We shouldn't be spending working life paying off college debt.
@Quixoticnance true and we should value people who educate themselves in non traditional ways too!
@ScottWx_TWN history and international relations probably? Interested in so many things.
@stoutde so many do and it's no weakness to not know what is in your best interests at 18

@rdcrisp @HillaryClinton She was Sec of State. She's a caring advocate for women and minorities. She's a fighter. Extraordinary in many ways
@rdcrisp @HillaryClinton well let's see: she's a brilliant student of policy and law. She's had top experience in foreign relations(1/2)
@CowboyDanPaasch @iafastro @SpaceX @elonmusk he never stops. That's why he is great.
@FitAcademic @kejames @BadPhysics ouch.
@FitAcademic @kejames @BadPhysics that's hard! Makes me remember to get myself down as soon as it starts even if I feel silly for a while.
@kejames exactly - I've been caught a few times but only by someone much stronger and they were semi expecting it.
@kejames yes - they basically made Hillary keep moving when she was blacking out which is pretty terrible.
@JimMoor70058163 @Tripfania :-)

@ddfdba sure but he got this far so we can't let ourselves get "Brexit-ed" here with complacency.
@ddfdba and underlying racism and bigotry plus the celebrity adoration in US.
@ddfdba a legitimate candidate for President that has ~40% support? We can't ignore it.

@thequarrylab @stealthygeek well *okay* then
@sarahcruddas it was cool!! There were submarines so now we know there is liquid water.
@TheLeanMarie well yeah if we get a gravity assist  we're sitting pretty! Well...ish....still a looooong way...
@CraftLass @headphonepete yeah that is tough when you have emotional ties. Such an awful thing to go through.
@CraftLass I miss it too! Oh no - what's wrong?
@Andyg1110 @NASAWebb yes!
@CraftLass our minds are ridiculously in sync. It's all the music and space and enthusiasm pulsing in our brains &lt;3
@CraftLass agree as long as we don't mess it up and fight. (Multinational telescope builders fight over ridiculous things)
@CraftLass I'm a Hillary voter - a pragmatist with dreams of space!
@CraftLass it actually does. I mean we can get carried away on grand possibilities but it always involves pragmatic decisions too.
@headphonepete @CraftLass I guess so. Would also give us a nice youthful glow to greet our alien overlords.
@Paladin1969 my consciousness would probably be better being sold at a Five and dime
@CraftLass I love how as human spaceflight geeks we have to face the battles in front of us first! #MarsOrBust
@CraftLass a lot less if things like nuclear thermal propulsion can be used but haven't been flown yet. And still like ~ 1000 years :-(

@DrMRFrancis it seems so strange. People have always enjoyed wildly different hobbies. Weird sense of superiority.
@PlanetDr ha! Ditto.
@CowboyDanPaasch :-)
@CwG_NSF it's a PITA - that's what it is :-)
The latest Q space! https://t.co/fyqdM9wWiq Thanks to @mikamckinnon #turkey #ankara
@ct_la @Enceladosaurus and "why are you making me feel uncomfortable about your suffering?"
@ct_la @Enceladosaurus I also hate the "I'm blessed" thing. Implies those of us struggling are less worthy and cursed.
@iangriffin @SOFIAtelescope Jealous - lifelong dream to go on SOFIA (and use the data)

@Pillownaut @GalenQuick @coachxcpayne @erikgregersen (ironic that the system has actually been "rigged" against women forever)
@DrMRFrancis you DID NOT JUST DO THAT!!! #arrrggh #KeyLargoMontego
@coachxcpayne @Pillownaut @GalenQuick @erikgregersen but he's all manly and trustworthy and can't have been plotting an evil takeover..
@Pillownaut @coachxcpayne @erikgregersen convinces me that the world sees all highly successful ambitious women as a little "evil"
@Pillownaut @coachxcpayne @erikgregersen do people really believe anyone is capable of this much "rigging" or conspiracy?
@coachxcpayne @Pillownaut @erikgregersen ha! I need one
@coachxcpayne @Pillownaut @erikgregersen I'm only buoyed by the fact that the crowd sounded small?
@Pillownaut @erikgregersen just when I think he has outdone himself..nope.
@zeynepchnn @selennata aw Thankyou! &lt;3
@Pillownaut @erikgregersen did he just say he is great at writing and "loves reading his stuff?"
@Pillownaut @erikgregersen OMG I just saw it. And "unhinged Cheeto" is my new favorite Trump insult
@DrMRFrancis we need to ban all comets until we figure out what's going on.
@CosmicKayle but he models his skin color on Jupiter
@upulie eat toast.
@Mark_HFX congrats!
Commentator's Curse with the @OXY_Crimson. Interviewing @TheMoon112 and @n0ned   https://t.co/9ASadLZprA
I will be streaming soon. @Wizzrobe will join at 6:10 pm pst and commentators curse at 730 with @TheMoon112 https://t.co/QsxQaTwegw
If you get @TheMoon112 in  I'm sure we can do a funny stick involving someone slapping me into him
@SSBM_Kira @_er0h I think he's referring to the Hitbox controller.  I have one if you want to check it out
@ChipotleTweets That's what my gf says! ;)
Just made it to HOT status for @ChipotleTweets https://t.co/DCAvTQEa0F
@ChipotleTweets thanks  you're the best
@makeishura caught a muk before
@_er0h click the bottom right button
@nottempts @CLG_PewPewU @ChipotleTweets @LiquidHbox That price makes no sense  considering 20 burritos is about $180
Gave you a shoutout in this video @TheMoon112   https://t.co/NpWVdrMUw4
@TheMoon112 @Hypnotoad__ I think it would be depressing if no one leveled up in 7 months  don't you agree?
@_er0h spider rolls are yummy. Otherwise I prefer traditional nigiri
@_er0h do better and prove them wrong through consistent excellence
@MrWiz @TheMoon112 tafo
@_er0h No ads is probably unrealistic  given contracts with vendors and streamers.
.@progducto between this burrito bowl and the free food I'll be getting. It's no contest @ChipotleTweets https://t.co/D8GeOsQTHT
I'll blog about my experiences  trying to earn all of the @ChipotleTweets benefits here:  https://t.co/1xMAc1LXGZ
@BullCraftMaxx @C9Mang0 predictable isoball killed them
Good starting points @ISS_Research @ISS_CASIS MT: “@GabrielleRab @RockefellerUniv. I would love to send an experiment into space!”
@spasmunkey all great art is ephemeral.  RIP Chumpkin 10/20-10/25/13.  The microbes win again...
Watch out  @Astro_Andreas  @Thom_astro has learned how to replicate himself.
The Chumpkin is sporting some hyphae. @spasmunkey I used to put AmphotericinB in my cell cultures. What does one put on a pumpkin?  Lamasil?
@spacechelle @msengupta @astro_reid Also  I'm pretty sure you and @Astro_Maker owe us one rendition of "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"
@Astro_Andreas @Thom_astro Just that I miss my two favorite interchangeable astronauts :) Hope you had fun at #SocialSpace
@Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas - Mogensquet?
@sharonbrunton Not yet.  I think it is just studying us.
@spacechelle @sdtingle You speak the truth.  There are only so many aileron rolls one can handle after lunch.
@psutympany we've been living underwater for 5 days so this helps the nitrogen come out of our blood slowly
@Astro_Clay @Astro_Soichi @AstroAcaba @Astro_Andreas but we all live in Bob the Barracuda's world down here http://t.co/uEIbTLIfpm
@Carbon_Flight @FCTMike @NicoleAtNASA I'm in. Age 12 I didn't make it onto the crew  I was science backroom. But I thought that was cooler.
@spasmunkey so you're saying we should try to be on good behavior now?
@JohnRSports that was a great NASA event  pretty cool to combine telescopes  @tweetsoutloud  and some really fun and interested kids!
@ageekmom of course I remember - couldn't forget fun times with #SpaceTweeps
@spacechelle @Cubs History and family are special!  Congratulations to you and the Cubs!
@Space_Station @OrbitalATK @csa_asc Dex is back at the Space Station!
@astro_reid @vr_doug @BlueAngels Dex did many years ago...told us about the incredible stick forces.  Glad you had a memorable ride!🚀
@TheMarsGen Happy Birthday!!
@sjpruzin Yes  4th grade is awesome--she takes on many more responsibilities and we have great conversations and adventures! 📚🍁🍂
Enjoyed catching up with a very real friend from the @vr_doug lab at NASA. https://t.co/yZOfQFnmky

@Astro_Clay @FisherPenCo Thanks very much  Clay!  The "ordinary" things you did were quite extraordinary!
@DrSamStrauss Teaching is a challenging and rewarding job...but never an easy job.
@NASAhistory @Astro_Alex @esa Happy Birthday!  May it be special🎂🎉🎁
@NewsFromSpace Thanks for the birthday flashback 🎂🎉
@UniphiSpaceAge Thank you much!  This 41st orbit brought many adventures.  It gave me new opportunities to be with those I love!  🌺🌸
@spacechelle @astro_reid @Astro_Kate7 @astro_kjell @AstroSerena @Astro_Jeremy  I think Chumps 🐒will find this peacock behavior bizarre 😜
@AstronautAbby I ran 7 miles with my dog  Winnie.  I think Mars "pets" will be companion robots with AI.
@AstronautAbby @TheMarsGen Challenge accepted!  Let's all do something good for us!
@Astro_Clay @AstroRM @Astro_Naoko Happy Anniversary of launch day!  Sleep shifted  walk out  loaded  8.5 min accelerate ... Space! 🚀🌌
@AstroWendyL Specific gravity at work.

@UniphiSpaceAge @Astro_Clay @astro_oz @Astro_127 @SuperBowl @NFL #SuperBowl #Broncos
@azspacecampgirl @Astro_Clay Maybe-fruit needs to be able to survive ground handling  scrubs  &amp; launch jostling.  Plums may be most sturdy
@Astropular @Astro_Naoko @Space_Station I was glad to work with such talented and smart women!
@SJKincaidBooks @TheMarsGen I love it--inspiring the next generation through reading and imagination 🚀🎇
@JohnRSports @BadAstronomer One should never take a geologist for granite 😜
@spacechelle @spacemama @AstroMiceRule @Astro_Clay I'm surprised Clay didn't alert me about this!!! 🧀
@Astro_Clay Yes; I am pro and proud of teachers!!
@AstroPip @TheMarsGen Where do you live?  While you may not qualify for this scholarship  others exist.  Also  camps in Turkey and Canada.
Excited to be on Alumni Advancement Board for Space Camp!  @JohnRSports @dr_hanson @crkey @bmgencel @Hotel_Girl @CarieLemack @Cowboydani1

@Astro_Clay @daylekny Think more along the lines of Princess and the Pea 👑
@Astro_Clay @Grathio how about a throne?  😜👑
@MITEFnw Looking forward to hearing from @b0yle Roger Myers @interplanetary &amp; Kim Binsted
@tracy_karin @SkyscrapersInc Thanks so much--I believe we need to solve problems and dream and explore.
@STEMJeff hang in there!  I'm trying not to think about food.  It would be easier if I could go jump in a rover and distract myself!
@dancingRNA @TheMarsGen Let's do it for scholarships  Trinna!
@Astro_Clay @Carbon_Flight @NASA Why thank you!  I ❤️ to represent the Evergreen state 🌲
@TheMarsGen @TEDxSIL @EverettCC @EdmondsCC I'm looking forward to sharing and connecting!
@Carbon_Flight @NASA It's definitely a good reason to come to the Pacific Northwest!
@spacechelle It's stunning  funny  and thrilling!  I'll enjoy discussing with you.
@BluebirdPtchATL @GeorgiaTech I think you'll enjoy it!  The book was a page turner and the movie doesn't disappoint.

http://t.co/PezIwd6Yhu @vr_doug Congratulations on this deserved recognition!  You are instrumental in space walks and exploration at NASA
It's not science fiction; it's real...@AstronautAbby is launching The Mars Generation.  Learn about it here:http://t.co/1CYaFqeJlP
@Astro_Nicole @MAKERSwomen I've always loved the power I felt running; I'm so glad these young women are using it to bring about change!
@d_l_miller @Astro_Clay Did they involve patches  shots  food?
@d_l_miller have a great school year!  You are making an important difference
@d_l_miller No!  That's a very sweet space shirt!
@Astro_Clay @azspacecampgirl Flattered but the math doesn't work out.
@d_l_miller @JohnRSports @SpaceCampUSA Especially the real rocks....ie geology 😜
@jaylupold My cousin got the microscope and I got the telescope--we spent many good days exploring!
@azspacecampgirl @Astro_Clay It is  and Dex was an amazing commander and a good friend.
@spacechelle @SpaceCampHOF @spasmunkey @tweetsoutloud @vincentvazzo @jbjim @Ekbierman Cool family photo!
@ESAstro_trainer @ReefBase @NASA_NEEMO wow  2  I have to admit I'm a bit jealous.
@jnmatthew @Astro_Clay 😜👍🏼
@ESAstro_trainer @ReefBase @NASA_NEEMO @astro_luca Tarpin!  Hope you get some night diving in  too!
@SpaceCampAlumni @SpaceCampUSA  I think so!  Beautiful night + catching up with friends + good music = FUN
@Astro_Clay @CamillaSpace Claytooooooooon!  We need you to come dance the funky chicken 😜
@AstronautAbby Space Camp!  😜
@NASA_Marshall @PercivalLowell Yes I visited in the summer of 2003 because of the history of the telescopes!
@azspacecampgirl @Astro_Clay Some stories need to be spilled 😜.  He'll get me back.
@Astro_Jeremy @drcrater Sounds like the start of a new SciFi movie!
@SpaceCampBoss @SpaceCampAlumni @SpaceCampKerby @SpaceCampUSA On my way from ATL to HSV I will time warp.  ✈️Takeoff: 1025 Landing:1023
@CandiMa1 @Astro_Clay @azspacecampgirl @AstroRM Nice--that's exactly how I masterminded it to go down...waHaHaHaHa🐁🐭🐹🐀
@SpaceCampAlumni @SpaceCampUSA @SpaceCampBoss Thanks for a great visit!  I enjoyed talking to all the campers!

@jotulloch I will never forget; I loved that day!
@Hear1by1 Thanks for the shout out!
@SpaceCampBoss @SpaceCampUSA @NASA @RocketCenterUSA @SpaceCampAlumni I'm looking forward to sharing and encouraging future explorers!
@icarusfactor Yes!  Kids of all ages got excited; I love that energy.
@jaylupold Bummer  that's usually the weather here.
@jaylupold I'm glad that SEEC was great for another year; it was always great to play and dance with the teachers.
@nujoud I'm back to being a student and working on a MS in environmental geology at the UW.
@jaylupold Happy New Year!  Here's to new adventures and explorations in 2015!
@selyb I left NASA  so I'm not going to fly again.  However  many great folks are continuing the exploration dream!
@nujoud Yes  Steven's Pass!  It's a great skiing area for the family.
@SpaceCampAlumni @spacechelle everyone hanging out?  It would be fun to be there!
@SpaceKSCBlog Thanks for sharing this; it's interesting to see another pt-of-view.
@Space_Lectures HappyThanksgiving to you  too!  Much to reflect upon and give thanks for.
@jaylupold @Cmdr_Hadfield And we all had a blast!  Our mentors encouraged us  and we hope to do the same for others.
@Astro_Clay Hope your ears are burning because I'll be talking about my incredible friends and what a privilege it was to fly with them!
@SallyRideSci in elementary school I dissected a cow's eye  heart  and lung.  I learned so much  and these parts would've just gone to waste
@ESAstro_trainer @NASA_NEEMO @Astro_Andreas @Astro_Jeremy Looks like a good crew!  Enjoy exploring and testing .
@SpaceCampUSA Work hard in school  pursue a degree in science  and aim for getting a job at NASA.  20 years after attending I flew in space
@jaylupold Have a wonderful year!  I wish your students the best  and thank you for your dedication and enthusiasm.
@Astro_Clay we're at the Woodland Park Zoo.  These made me think of you! http://t.co/HBlcXuWQdx
@DanSpace77 I won't be returning  but we can watch my friends as they continue the mission.
@jaylupold perfectly spoken  indeed!
@LynnSherr Thank you for researching and writing Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space.  It provides depth to an incredible woman.
@Cole_Anderson70 @Astro_Clay Go Cole!  Training is some of the hardest but most rewarding work!
@NASA_SLS very cool!  Thanks for the insight into a talented engineer!
@Aki_Hoshide @Astro_Jeanette @Astro_Sabot @Thom_astro @NASA_NEEMO Have a wonderful mission!  Looking forward to following you all.
@Thom_astro Have a great NEEMO 18 mission!
@Astro_Clay ;0) July 20th we can celebrate 45 years of knowing what it is really made of!
@ageekmom Geek moms gotta share their stories!
@DrSamStrauss that's exactly right!  Great to hear from you  Dr!
@libbydoodle @spacecampusa I dreamed BIG--20 years later my dreams became a reality.
@robcarrphoto I hadn't thought about using other technology.  I thought the "old fashioned way" with locating Polaris &amp; angle off horizon.
@jaylupold Very nicely put; exactly what I would expect from someone who bridges the arts and sciences with young students!
@Carbon_Flight @odyssey_flight It was an awesome day--always a pleasure to watch teamwork in action.  Now on to the Olympic Teams.
@NurcDiver @astro_nicole For real?!?  Well have a week to remember because  we won't forget you.  Please keep in touch.
@ESAstro_trainer Great article--I miss talking an texting with the team.  Hope all is well on the other side of the pond :0)
@thenasaman YES!  Thank you for informing and inspiring the next generation.
@mlazarusdean I cannot believe it has been a year; These men are all very talented and I miss working with them.
@sharonbrunton Fish are our friends (in the habitat)  but up here on land they are a part of my diet :)
@jaylupold Absolutely!  Wise words.
@rewir8rh83 Thank you for following; keep watching NASA as we explore!
@JohnRSports :0). I'm sure that is what my daughter imagines.
@therealdjflux We're glad you followed along!
@Astro_Clay Kathleen is amazing!  Great friend and mentor in college.  7billion people but still connected!
@Thedreadpirate @astro_nicole Today I used the same ride and a jet pack.
@Astro_Clay Wilco  Clay-tOn!
@SallyRideSci Including little girls like me!
@Astro_Nicole hope you get to visit; this is an amazing habitat and our research is compelling! http://t.co/ohDJSoP4
@mwilkinson3 @esastro_trainer @ustream I tend to forget unless I do something like spill my lunch all over and have to clean it up
@jaylupold That would be great.  My mom is: @JoyceMetcalf2
@ESAstro_trainer He outfitted us well!
@ESAstro_trainer @nasa_neemo Great seeing you guys in the water.  Such a gorgeous day!
@jaylupold N16 are not studying that  but when I spoke w/ NOAA it sounds like scientists are trying to understand through more research here
@jaylupold @reefbase @nasa_neemo @astro_kimiya @astro_timpeake @neemo_steve The hard coral is dying  but the sponges and fish are thriving
@Stratocumulus Thanks for the shout out!  I agree  we are learning and doing amazing things down here!
@mrbdv @nasa_neemo @reefbase @spacecampusa Follow us at #NEEMO16 and our Science Under Pressure.
@d_l_miller April of 1990; what did Discovery take to space that same month and year?
@Carbon_Flight @spacecamphof @spacecampusa @spasmunkey Congratulations to all!
@amikokauderer HMmmm  it is not fair to talk about waffles or fish while we are in the Hab ;)
@spasmunkey @astroserena @astrosamantha @krubins Inspired in April of 1990  flew STS-131 April 2010
@AstroSamantha @spasmunkey @astroserena @krubins I agree  &amp; I thought about all of you today and what your accomplishments mean to daughter
@therealdjflux It's 100% humidity but the temp is delightful!
@Astro_Clay I knew there was a good reason to stay in Aquarius habitat!
@ESAstro_trainer Thanks for all your support and help today; it's great knowing you are on the team!
@jaylupold This provides air (through compressors)  power  and communication.  We call it the Life Support Buoy.
@therealdjflux No  this provides air (through compressors)  power  and communication.  We call it the Life Support Buoy.
@jayjum Cool factor; but actually they look like the real suits we use in space.
@d_l_miller @nasa_tv I feel the same--but celebrating that people are looking up!
@jayjum @neemo_steve No  but it made for exciting dinner.
@amikokauderer Should be an awesome adventure!
@Astro_Clay I voted  too  and I agree that we are blessed and should take every opportunity to vote.
@ESAstro_trainer @padi @astro_timpeake Always good to practice so that we are prepared for anything  but I don't want to be that diver.
@spasmunkey @saroy Looking forward to June 5th
@JohnRSports @astro_pettit You got it; looking forward to June 5th.
@Astro_yyz great thing about today's technology!
@HollandSpaceCen excellent!
@spasmunkey We will have some autonomy  but this is part of the experiment.  We'll see what happens and what crews might need in the future
@spasmunkey Yes--we are such multi-taskers (as a whole society).  Our mission will look at 50 sec one way.
@jayjum I agree; we are not a very patient society.  During the mission we will have a 50sec one way delay
@Astro_Clay oops--I didn't guess anything;)
@Astro_Clay I'm going to guess that it is a volcano erupting in the Mediterranean?!?
@spasmunkey Yes!  EVH.   Nice job Spasmunkey!   Won't be exact  but will post when complete :-)
@Astro_Mike @IntrepidMuseum Fly Navy!   :-)
@Carbon_Flight @AstroAcaba              Fun!
@Carbon_Flight @foreman_mike I like it!
@spasmunkey .....will do!
@AstroPeggy     Go Peggy!
@NASA_Astronauts @Astro_Wheels ........go Wheels!
@SpaceCampBoss @SpaceCampUSA @Check_Six        Meeeee tooooooo Mike!
@spacechelle Wish I could Chelle!   You and Hock have a great event coming up!   Love it!
@Astro_Clay You got it Clay!
@spacechelle miss ya Chelle!
@Astro_Kate7 @spacechelle @msengupta @astro_reid    uh ohhhhh...I think she's lost that loving feeling Tonto...time to break out the whites!
@selyb thank you Selynn fir helping today!   It was great meeting you!
@selyb Thank you...its beautiful out here!
@AstronautAbby This was his first camp  Mach 1.  :-)
@jegpeek Blimey. Everyone’s getting into the suborbital space game these days.
@AstroKatie @JPMajor Yet somehow make your presence felt through gravity. That's the hard bit.
@aallan Except the number not on the latest system is growing rapidly
@alex_parker @nolatredd Also reduces the proportion of the Universe within 2016’s light-cone.
@jen_gupta Which has cheaper car insurance?
@cosmos4u @PlanetAndrewC @Dr_Lucie @ESA_ExoMars @ESA_EDM Right  but the landing systems are very different.
@SHSKPhysics @robinince Of course but both are pretty stubbon! Dark matter much more sensible than dark energy which makes little sense
When spacecraft reach planets  astronomers look to @astronomyblog and his interplanetary lobbing scoreboard:  https://t.co/TJjv7sKOMM
@w4bily5iszvvzjq They’re a few hundred million euros short currently.
@chrisuk27 @esa It was  yes. Though I think only after the point where problems occurred.
@msbentley @esa_edm Apart from  well  landing…
@mountainhippo @esa_edm No idea.
@azureblue23 @esa_edm I think they’re just being very careful  and to be fair were very clear before that @ESA_EDM was a test.
So that’s it: @ESA_EDM was an interesting engineering test  which will need analysis. Seems clear science package lost.
Something odd happens in the @ESA_EDM data when the parachute is released. ‘Lander did not behave as expected’ from this point.
Focus on @esa_edm must be driving @esa mad. The orbiter - @esa_tgo - was by far the most important so it’s great that that’s in right orbit.
Not clear to me at least what the status of @esa_edm is : they’re saying there’s data from the lander - but not necessarily on the ground.
The orbiter is the most valuable piece of the mission  so this is great. @esa_edm would be great icing on the cake https://t.co/GraihJn6QO
@mggtTaylor @PlanetDr @elakdawalla @ESA_TGO Doing real work today sadly
@aallan Presumably also consistent with a landing that was very nearly successful…
@kiai_kas @esaoperations That doesn’t mean @esa_edm is ok. Just the start of transmission…
The @esa_edm team had expected to have to wait for relay from @esa_tgo in just under an hour…
@wilksjeremy @pbdes We need orbiters for communications.
@megschwamb Live tweeting very welcome.
@cosmos4u Don’t give us too much credit; there aren’t coordinates there…nor a band.
@aallan Right
Phew! @ESA_TGO now free to head for its science orbit  and @ESA_EDM for an inevitable encounter with Mars itself. https://t.co/vpkLuY6gBk
Next up  #proximab discoverer Guillem Anglada-Escudé - 'if Neptune's orbit is a pizza  Jupiter's orbit is a pepperoni slice' @RoyalAstroSoc
.@apontzen delivering his @royalastrosoc award lecture. Congrats on both that award and a choice of a very stylish… https://t.co/kZ5bGFHTaH
Today’s @RoyalAstroSoc ordinary meeting looks anything but: https://t.co/5nCQvaQv52
@astronomyblog just a large crowdfunding campaign and a plan short of Mars
@ngc3314 They’re just too rare to have a decent training set  I think.
@AndreaWiggins So do ours...
@allplanets @megschwamb I’m not a huge fan of the tech argument; it’s too easily used by politicians to target funding to ‘useful’ research.
@megschwamb @allplanets stories about the funding part. A slide at the end thanking funders isn’t good enough.
@megschwamb @allplanets Yeah. I think that we (a) never say when good ideas are blocked by lack of funding. (b) never talk when telling…
@mrwobblelegs @esa_rosetta @bbcstargazing Thanks!
@penguingalaxy @oxfordsitp Actually  that’s just @vrooje. The rest of us are here: https://t.co/gMHOsh9T59
@PenguinGalaxy @oxfordsitp I can't believe you're speaking in Oxford while the entire team are abroad
@Somena Right now I'm complaining about the tone. Whatever the politics talking about people this way is damaging and hurtful
@daverothery If @hannahdev talked to the same people I did today  #BepiColombo was notably absent from their comments. Which was odd.
@AndreasSchepers Thanks
@AndreasSchepers Can I bug you for the high-resolution version of that? Lovely pic.
@AstroEmz nice work. Sorry we haven't run into you yet!
@ExplorerDale @BBCAmos @BBCStargazing @BBCFOUR @ESA_Rosetta No - that was a complete surprise. Made life a lot more interesting!
@GeertHub Most of that is data transfer.
@RobertGaristo @JPMajor Waves from mission control
@mggtTaylor Coward
@mggtTaylor Any bands in particular we should play under that comment?
.@mggtTaylor  crashing @ESA_Rosetta makes sure it goes out at its best  unlike 'bands from the 60s who are still touring' #cometlanding
@ProfMike_M Can I suggest the Journal of Brief Ideas? https://t.co/YpdO9pzOSh. You get a DOI and everything
@mggtTaylor @Bobby_Seagull @elss_freeschool I did and agreed. They all sat up when I mentioned you...
@Bobby_Seagull @elss_freeschool Sorry I had to dash! Will say hi to @mggtTaylor for you all.
@jen_gupta @downcastapp to hear @Radiolab @NightValeRadio @TheSporkful @story_collider @ThirdCoastFest @SongExploder and lots more.
@harcel @hannorein @demitrimuna Right  I’m imagining some selection based on track record of contributing to useful software.
@hannorein @demitrimuna One of the UK research councils tried software fellowships and was buried under a stampede of applicants.
@hannorein @demitrimuna I suspect the solution is to fund good people (to write software) rather than funding good software.
@demitrimuna @sarahkendrew I meant that consolidated grants weren’t the right mechanism  not that it was impossible to fund software in UK
@sarahkendrew @brettmor @demitrimuna It's definitely allowed. Not sure that system would favour such an application.
@dalcashdvinsky @GeertHub yes  come to @OxfordPhysics and @the_zooniverse
@brettmor @demitrimuna The @arxiv model is interesting - pointing out to institutions that they host users.
@kennicosmith @SkelligSP @ROGAstronomers Lovely to see you again. Hope all continues well
@m_vandenbrouck @microsoft @marscuriosity @hololens It’s great  isn’t it?
@jr_pritchard How helpful. Because we’ve notoriously just not talked to anyone else all these years.
@biblioforgetful Hmm. Thanks for putting all the buttons in the right places - credit where credit's due!
@realscientists You're either taking too generally or you're out of date. Plenty of places explicitly include broader impact in hiring
@shenovafashion @karenlmasters @robertcnichol I would be so up for supporting that. Fingers crossed!
@JLGalache Yes: but sadly less likely to make it happen
@stephencwll Proposal to @esascience led by @martinabarstow
@SciGuySpace I saw ‘on the pad’ in the @spacex statement which isn’t the same as ‘with the pad’. Or do you know more?
@aallan @astrobrigi That rules out most of their customer base  which doesn’t seem smart.
@astrobrigi @aallan Crikey  you’re right. Recovery from last loss was fast  so prob. not problems with timing. Reliability worries  though
@nova_road Thanks. Very useful work today.
@Jane_MacArthur They have backup launch windows into October  so should be ok even if there’s substantial collatoral damage.
@astrobrigi @aallan I’m pretty sure none of the upcoming Astrophysics or Planetary missions are booked on Falcon 9.
@astro_liz @summer_ash @planetdr Sorry  you’re quite right. Still trying to erase old habits.
@aallan Sure. And actually still ahead of Ariane V at similar stage. But still - wonder what tolerance customers have.
@Astro_Jonny Thanks
@Astro_Jonny Do you have source for claim it was static fire? I mean  that makes sense but haven’t seen that reported yet.
@WellsiteGeo First use. Trial of reuse was planned for October.
Reports from reliable sources (via @nova_road and others) suggest that a @spacex Falcon 9 rocket just exploded on the launch pad. #spacex
@standupmaths What (book? video?) would you recommend for english lit scholar who wants to understand how mathematicians view infinity?
@StephenCWLL Yep  next month's program is all about this
@jonny_nichols That would be fab. Let us know what you find!
@PlanetDr @doug_ellison Absolutely. It'll be fun finding out which this is though
@drarnakarick @vacant3rdman Just to be provocative - I think we need fewer astronomers building UX and more UX experts...
@drarnakarick @orbitingfrog @mrniaboc I don’t think I got an acceptable answer.
@drarnakarick All of them. All of them published by those who submitted them
@reneehlozek Interesting title!
@npr247 @kevinschawinski IT’S FINE I WAS AMUSED
@DavidHartley62 Sure. Anything you tweet might be recorded and used for training and quality control purposes...
@doug_ellison @cwg_nsf @marscuriosity Thanks for the update.
@cosmos4u Is it clear whose models are reliable? I wrote this up as a chance to test all of these models.
Starting the @LSST data science school with @shaka_lulu reviewing the code of conduct: https://t.co/aB9UWfhjGl
@shaka_lulu Do we have a hashtag?
@hannorein @naturenews @alsassociation Exactly.
@standupmaths What sort of solid?
@michaelaye Agreed. But for me the line is in developing user experience - there is a wealth of experience there we just don't have
@joezuntz @reneehlozek Good to see you last night https://t.co/xWjQfCnE2c cc @mrniaboc @drphilmarshall
@robertcnichol Are you at the #LSSTgalaxies meeting?
@david_hurn You were here? You should have said hi
@jegpeek @StAldatesTavern @LSST have a beer and all will seem well.
@CaseyDreier @NASA @SciGuySpace He's not wrong  but @ESA_Rosetta counts as a mission beyond Mars.
@StephenCWLL @BBCStargazing Olympics
@tweetsoutloud @PlanetDr Any chance of a pointer to those papers?
@hastroparr Yes. But something is wrong because it's not 50/50 and I don't believe brains are unevenly distributed.
@hastroparr I have many talented female colleagues. More would be better.
@hastroparr So why are there so few women in Astro?
@hastroparr @dephelis Problem is culture of such 'jokes' deters women entering our field. Good for you for not  but others are put off.
@Daz555 @PeoplesAstro I like jokes. A broadcaster sending a message that half of humanity aren't welcome in Astro isn't funny
@PeoplesAstro Good for you. In the meantime  we'll be over here trying to fix the under representation of women in physics.
@PeoplesAstro For fuck's sake.
@mattkenworthy @BenneHolwerda @davidwhogg is there a paper on that?
@Luke_Hometree @BBCStargazing The effect's pretty small  but there will be a slight delay
@DERBY5HIRE @BBCStargazing The Olynpics
@BBCStargazing #skyatnight debut for @jonny_nichols - Britain's #juno expert
@woozydewsy @BBCStargazing Yes. I can't watch
@astronomyblog of course.
@BBCStargazing viewers - that's @LeighFletcher who nearly convinced me Uranus was exciting once.

@JayAlver @elakdawalla None
@stephencwll I didn’t say I was reporting that…
@mirikramer @elakdawalla @alexwitze @RachelFeltman @lorengrush PSA: I made coffee but it's bloody strong.
@BBCMorelle @alexwitze #bestengineersintheworld #dust
@alexwitze #fireworks
I’ll be filming during today’s #juno arrival so follow @elakdawalla for up to the minute updates (&amp; @startorialist for all the JPL fashion)
@becky1505 @GeertHub Also we need an individual equation. Christmas excitement not constant across individuals
@jonny_nichols @elakdawalla Would be nice but coffee essential!
@mggtTaylor What’s the reason for the auto shutoff? https://t.co/PQGP9dThhU
I just wish this would stop. Can’t believe even @mggtTaylor is involved.  https://t.co/SDIBfY1lwM
@mirikramer Are you going to be at JPL?
@tim_o_brien @bbcstargazing It’s ok. We’re only reporting success of the PAM (Peanut Acquisition Manoeuvre) performed by @savagekt
Ok  *now* the @BBCStargazing team are ready to arrive at Jupiter #juno https://t.co/U4idROcx4c
@kidderowski @bbcamos Yes! It’s going to be incredible. Anytime we go somewhere new…
@robertcnichol Quite an odd set of diffraction spikes too
@iainkun @AEWmac @BBCAmos @BBCStargazing Oops. I had no idea!
@StephenCWLL Sadly otherwise engaged.
@carlyhowett @alex_parker @elakdawalla Tell me about it (currently heading JPLwards for Juno). At least July 4th isn’t a real holiday.
@carlyhowett Seriously  though - Jan 1st? Couldn’t you have made @alex_parker and friends find something more convenient? cc @elakdawalla
@forrestn290 @bowbrick @nasajuno Yes  Jupiter has surprisingly strong aurora. Juno - arriving Monday - will help us find out why
@glenboigmark And there was a bus!
#nam2016 K2 also open from beginning which has had this effect (from @GeertHub at #dotastro last week) https://t.co/JLOIK3uo5V
@astrotweeps Really? Most of my colleagues are physicists  and few have looked through telescopes.
@jen_gupta @zemogle @astrofrog @astrofairy That's how it's spelt  right?

@zemogle @astrofairy @jen_gupta A
@zemogle @astrofairy @jen_gupta H
@zemogle @astrofairy @jen_gupta Do we have chants and things?
@astrolr @elakdawalla @megschwamb None. Perhaps @sarahkendrew or @IsobelHook know?
@mandypatrish @vrooje @galaxyzoo @NASA_Hubble Isn't it?
@drarnakarick @kellecruz @sarahkendrew Should have said - write questions so we know what to answer. #dotastro
@drarnakarick @kellecruz @sarahkendrew Someone start writing the FAQ. Completely sold on nomination. #dotastro
@eteq I agree with that. You can probably have an effective distributed conference but it’s completely different from an effective f2f one.
Help @drarnakarick and @sam_astrophys sort through @NASA’s archive of Apollo images: #dotastro hack https://t.co/FXzQoXqitP
@aagie @nasakepler @geerthub I don’t think that’s what Geert said - wasn’t he talking about TESS?
@eteq @geerthub We have a publishing for software session led by @astrofrog @augustmuench on Thu.
Since @NASAKepler data was opened up (K2 vs original mission) - more papers  &amp; more early career authors. #openscience works! #dotastro
@brunomerin @eteq Was wondering if you’re maintaining your own data store or pulling from what exists.
Excellent example of #openscience - raw data from @NASAKepler hits the archive a few hours after being taken  open to all #dotastro
@mattkenworthy @aagie @astrofrog Ooh. Can we visualise the Galaxy Zoo decision tree with the Hololens and sort galaxies by walking along it?
@eteq You’d hope https://t.co/Pu8ZQFOTPJ would read from MAST. @Brunomerin?
Really enjoying the demo of https://t.co/Pu8ZQFOTPJ at #dotastro. #Skyatnight viewers might enjoy exploring the view of M51 @BBCStargazing
@merrdiff @kellecruz We deliberately select participants from wide range of backgrounds  but think having to apply is problematic.
@merrdiff @kellecruz We get that criticism  but I think it’s from people who haven’t been.
@drarnakarick Let’s talk at coffee
@astrofrog @aagie @dotastronomy @AstroBrigi @metoffice Was going to write a funny reply but 'yes'
@davidwhogg @AstroGinaB Maybe you should nominate someone to be you? @GeertHub  for example
@StrangerNoise @LIGO I think that would help but would trade for lots more around Earth
Fellow Brits at #aas228 - the @FieldIrishPub is open for #ENGvWAL tomorrow at 6am. Who's in? @GeertHub @mrtommyb
@jegpeek Just amused me. Hadn't heard it before
@megschwamb @astrotweeps How do feel about repeats?
If you’d like to build with @the_zooniverse project builder while you’re at #AAS228 - come find me  @vrooje or @kevinschawinski #AAS228
search for the Voorwerpjes - the smaller cousins of the Voorwerp - came from close collaboration between pro @NGC3314 &amp; citizens #AAS228
Namecheck for @PenguinGalaxy and the @GalaxyZoo community in @kevinschawinski's talk #aas228
@NolaTRedd they look cute but play havoc around lunchtime
@AAS_Office If @kevinschawinski isn’t wearing that scarf I will be upset. #AAS228
@vencut2 @BBCStargazing Thanks! If only it had been clear too...
@r_d_alexander @profmike_m @vrooje There are reasons for the MW to be special  though - vel disp v. different from other measures.
@merrdiff There’s no mic in our session which is disappointing #AAS228
@AdrianSpalinky I'm hoping the lighting changes for each talk
@Roy_Astro @CassiniSaturn That's the idea - good mineralogical evidence too
@jen_gupta Planetary migration?
@MarsOneProject How many candidates have withdrawn?
Enjoying talk by Scott Tremaine @OxfordPhysics - arguing Oort Cloud includes several Mars-sized 'dark planets' cc @megschwamb
@markmccaughrean ‘Dinosaur in heroic attempt to save Earth as mammals scuttle to save themselves’
@susan_snowy Sadly not. Decided to give @dallascampbell a free run at Top Trumps this year.
@philipbull Yes.
@cosmos4u @hugho2 Agreed. Don’t think the release reflects the paper at all  which is sad.
@cosmos4u @hugho2 Yep  paper was on astro-ph before acceptance  press release followed acceptance. Seems ok to me.
@cosmos4u To be fair  the original sin is in the press release https://t.co/JpVK24RZnL
@ngc3314 @galaxyzoo That sounds amazing.
@megschwamb Right  but if asteroids brought the water and are amino acid rich...
@Spaceboffins Not in a paper  though  I think?
@b0yle Thanks.
@b0yle Though it’s true we don’t need more classifications right now.
@b0yle Just seen your article on @planetaryrsrcs. Asteroid Zoo is more on hiatus than in ‘limbo’ - the team are working on the data…
@PenguinGalaxy @KmunityOfEquals @the_zooniverse delighted you're there though! Have fun
@michaelaye Hell yes
@KmunityOfEquals @PenguinGalaxy @the_zooniverse Our application for a talk was turned down  which is a shame
@arielwaldman The former - very much so  with the data looking good. The second is on hiatus.
@jen_gupta it's an amazing job that deserves someone great. Or everyone great...
@e_astronomer Spent ages working out all the bits. The best thing is that the Moon ball (sadly cut off that pic) shows the correct phase…
@stellarplanet You missed out a few letters. Swap ‘is’ for ‘involves’
@adrianspalinky I don’t know - Patrick once ended an episode with aliens appearing outside the windows of Farthings…
@jegpeek I certainly think some invited talks at ADASS from people thinking about services/web would help.
@shaka_lulu Alas
@shaka_lulu Please tell me you made that specially

@wellsitegeo It is Cumbrian  so probably!
@markmccaughrean Wow. Bad papers in both of my main interests!
@megschwamb We forget in astronomy that most fields have to distinguish  but most of our journals are pretty good..
@megschwamb @markmccaughrean @kwwillett @weatheronmars To be fair  it was published in a peer-reviewed journal. Just not a highly ranked one
@markmccaughrean Aliens. Or Comets.
@markmccaughrean @kwwillett @weatheronmars @megschwamb At least I have a new case study for my ‘why crowdfunding is bad’ talk.
@kwwillett @drstuclark Just noticed the amount of money they’re asking for is shifting too. Now $18000  presumably to attract further cash.
@kwwillett @weatheronmars @megschwamb Also odd is insistence measurements be taken with comets in particular part of the sky.
Excellent cosmological use of The Journal of Brief Ideas by @jegpeek : https://t.co/9LJwpv4zIs (One for @reneehlozek perhaps?)

@SabotagedFool more like a network of seismographs. The more places you can make a detection from  the better you can pinpoint the source
@SabotagedFool Yes  there's a patch of sky where the signal must have come from. It's pretty large though...
@thewibblyone @RoyalAstroSoc So? Talk was today  and mission is going ahead.

@remcovdbosch @eteq @aas_publishing I think the question is really whether an auto generated plot will be better than the average…

@MWhale61 @BBCStargazing I agree @ESA_Rosetta somewhat short changed! That pesky Pluto took the icy slot...
@KieranTidmarsh @BBCStargazing We limited ourselves to the solar system. Including deep space would have made it nearly impossible!

@scute1133 @kwwillett Yep. Icarus papers now under review will be released in December...
@asrivkin @tedstryk @elakdawalla is @astrobites a useful model? A planetary-focused one wd be even more useful as articles are often hidden
@WellsiteGeo These days  what isn't?!?
@kwwillett @kevinschawinski And how many of them have we read?
@GeertHub Did you see this? https://t.co/6N6kjl5vFI
@megschwamb Congratulations - can we come to Hilo?
@mars_stu Thanks. Thought some of the camera angles were pretty good myself.
@plutokiller @WellsiteGeo @kbatygin I got a rock in the post today
@jmullan01 @bbcstargazing I don't think any planet has been 'found yet'  and I think he was very clear about that in the program!
@pedroperos Yep!
@pedroperos Yep. Though that's a lot of sky to cover  and it includes a nicely crowded patch of the Milky Way.
@cosmos4u Thanks! High praise coming from you
@LizMarchio @realscientists I think one can go further and say twin goals should be visible...not enough to hide 'real' goal under 'fun'
Guess what this month's #skyatnight is about? Cc @BBCStargazing https://t.co/IdjfLNSgGO

@BarefootCrofter Great question; I asked the same of @megschwamb earlier. Apparently there are reasons to believe that one was much bigger.
@mars_stu Won't catch on. Hopefully. 'Planet 9' has a nice ring to it  and will presumably infuriate @AlanStern….

@bulletford I will  at least briefly. It's been quite a week!
@Nighthawk_Black @Wikisteff @aussiastronomer @NASAKepler Not really sure what you mean - others could go and measure brightness from plate
@rhaegal @vrooje @aotatx Assuming it's rotating fast enough that a half finished one would show up in @NASAKepler data.
@chrisenorth @vrooje No  because we would then see a regular series of dips in Kepler light-curves.

@jegpeek Planet Hunters is consistently our most popular project (~200 000 or so participants) and I guess 50% of people astro?
@jegpeek @mrniaboc is the keeper of the stats.
@some_landscapes So completely sold on this  but only if Richard Long is involved.
@astronomolly @johndebes Expensive  though.

@Peter_Grindrod @UCL_CPS @andrewcohenbbc @BBCStargazing Sorry I threw your stuff on the floor
@astronomyblog I think not as low level but I am wondering. Literature rather sparse...
@penguingalaxy I wish this was easy. But yes  agreed.
@penguingalaxy ALL OF THEM
@reneehlozek Why are you getting emails from squirrels?
@kevinschawinski you can't serve more than one branch of the government at once  I think.
@cosmos4u Yes. But still impressive!
@SabotagedFool A huge amount of work goes into calibration
@jradavenport @GeertHub @davidwhogg @jonathansick @adrianprw @exoplaneteer @jegpeek almost certainly
@GeertHub @davidwhogg @jonathansick @adrianprw @exoplaneteer @jradavenport @jegpeek Will bring Oxford coffee.

@Tim_O_Brien @RadioAstrology I feel like we should actually do this. Somewhere with a bar. Money to charity.
@tim_o_brien @radioastrology @lucyfortson Let's invite @ProfBrianCox too.
@tim_o_brien @radioastrology Right. Can we have a Gamma-ray astrology breakout though? cc @LucyFortson
@tim_o_brien I'd certainly attend @radioastrology's conference : proper science!
@jradavenport @mrtommyb HAT-P-7b trick?
@jen_gupta @sarahkendrew @astrofairy @vrooje PhD-level jobs are exempt.
@spyder_webb No  but I'm sure we'll revisit Rosetta sometime soon.
@cloud149 @eteq @arfon Easily fixable. What say you  @AAS_Publishing?
@suziesheehy @vrooje @sarahkendrew I believe @euansmith and the @BBCStargazing team are en route so will shun you for them.
@cosmic_horizons I rely on them when in journalist mode for @BBCStargazing  for example.
@AstroKatie @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse Whoever does citizen science at ABC
@AstroKatie @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse They cloaned @oldweather a few years back too
@vrooje @astropixie @kevinschawinski @AstroKatie @galaxyzoo or at least have this project done so results are comparable
@astropixie @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse And what's the sample?
@astropixie @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse Seriously? Who's the science team?
First rule of #skyatnight club : NO PACEMAKERS IN THE PLANETERELLA. At least according to today's call sheet. cc @BBCStargazing
@AndreaWiggins @spaceyliz @crowdconsortium @na_case We can show in @SpaceWarps that people either improve or leave after ongoing feedback
@jegpeek  I#what I want for outreach on a CV is evidence for creative thinking not just a list of stuff participated in. Is code similar?
It helps that there's atmospheric science to be got from that image - tiny haze particles which should make @PlanetDr very happy #PlutoFlyby

@twitter : Made videos for @BBCStargazing last week which were fun (https://t.co/E0Cx8bDR9o) Can I have access to the Video tool to do more?
@stephencwll The left one is the closest to true colour. The right is 'exaggerated colour' - processed to bring out contrasts.
@elakdawalla @kennicosmith Will be available on the Sky at Night magazine cover disk (or use what @megschwamb calls 'internet magic')
Twitter credits! Don't forget @PlanetDr @CarlyHowett @DrBrianMay as well.  https://t.co/Eed5y7wV13
@carlyhowett Really? Don't think we were expecting anything until Friday.
@AstroPip I believe they're hoping for useful amount of power until 2030 at least. We will learn lots!
@astropixie @sarahkendrew @drplanet @darrencroton Oops. Should be @PlanetDr #tired #tholins
@CRiedlinger77 @BBCStargazing @NASANewHorizons next one coming from an edit suite  I hope
@bulletford Very good
@astrospike11 @BBCStargazing Yes. But we decided to match the pronunciation the @NewHorizons2015 team are using
.@daverothery points out I garble @elakdawalla's thoughts in the last @BBCStargazing vid. Go straight to the source: http://t.co/q6E2jEuHW5
@becky1505 @mggtTaylor retweeted. So three of you.
@Lil_Richardjohn @BBCStargazing We're still making it. Monday at 10
@NGC3314 @planet4589 @mikamckinnon apparently constraints from Kuiper belt size distribution.
@einionyn @toriweaver 'mouldy' has been suggested
@daverothery @Andy_666 cab you break ammonia down with the uv flux at Pluto?
@NolaTRedd Ah  but those mountains are water ice!
@kennicosmith @elakdawalla I thought that was sharp too. Isn't the problem the odds of such a collision recently v. low?
@PlanetDr @horstlab Roger that. Undertaking caffeine acquisition manoeuvre
@PlanetDr @horstlab All the things are nominal
@PlanetDr We are incoming for our flyby of your lab  hoping to detect Tholins #skyatnight
@JPMajor @PlanetDr Tholins over ice
@EddieArruza @shaka_lulu @markhammergren So glad you're covering it...
A very happy @CarlyHowett explains that EVERYTHING IS EXTREMELY NOMINAL #PLUTO #plutoflyby http://t.co/6Dva3g5T2Z
@psutympany Mission Operations Manager
@megschwamb Yes  though not about change - just comparison to prediction
.@jjbw 'Gunk' was scientifically approved terminology. I checked with @CarlyHowett and everything.
@stephencwll Yeah  that's real colour  but at a lower resolution than the detail. So some fudging but basically right.
@StephenCWLL Likely tomorrow. BUT The first colour pic from this morning is pretty close to true.
@mggtTaylor @BBCStargazing @AlanStern Not everyone can be bribed with gin
@psutympany the latter
@psutympany exaggerated to make difference clearer
Some planetary scientists are friendly! With @PlanetDr #plutoflyby http://t.co/t6iHXXEMAK
@cosmos4u @BBCStargazing @NASANewHorizons We had 1 in 10000 yesterday. Not sure about difference
@PlanetDr Hello! Would be great to catch up
@astronomyblog controversial early call - final result not in until tonight
@stopdown555 I think @megschwamb was suggesting that might be the case. Who knows?
@marsroverdriver it would be such a shame if all the news coverage focused on that and not on the fact Pluto is awesome
@markhardaker yes. He was very proud of knowing Clyde Tombaugh too
@Wigwam94 @BBCStargazing thanks!
@MGLewis314159 @BBCStargazing BBC say K but NASA Sh for Charon...
@planetdr Did you tell the truth about Pluto? #aliens
@astronomyblog Yep. Lack of atmosphere makes it much easier.
@megschwamb is that prediction altered by today's announcement of N further away than expected?
.@kennicosmith : quality was good - no lingering problems from safe mode. Colour images at higher resolution is 'really good'
The entire press corps: What does 'wow' mean? @kennicosmith : 'Fail safe' data reached ground - preflyby data sent as insurance policy
@boundangle @StarzanPlanets Yep. People have argued whether it becomes more Eris like later in its orbit
@acooray @pruss @StephenSerjeant @davecl42 @BenneHolwerda I don't understand that. Surely incentive to be a better ref if public
@alex_parker @bbcstargazing Great. We're on our way over. If you can spare us some time that'd be good - @elakdawalla can vouch for me!
@alex_parker Where are you for the flyby? Would be great to talk to you for @BBCStargazing
@seanam1310 @bbcstargazing https://t.co/SGP0n74lV4
Not long to go now! @BBCStargazing #plutoflyby http://t.co/19dDS4TyzC
@astrofairy @UKAstroNut @chrisenorth @zemogle I don't  but outreach is important
@becky1505 @vrooje @jen_gupta Clearly the message is working with @the_zooniverse is good for your career #NAM2015
@mggtTaylor @UnofficialNAM Why am I not surprised that you found the bunch of people I know well to drink with at NAM?
@SungrazerComets @jjaron Better. That would be fine
@jjaron @SungrazerComets I do think they could and should have added independent comment though
@jjaron @SungrazerComets it's difficult. It's by authors of an accepted talk at conference.Should press office have refused a release?
@sungrazercomets If it had been promoted as speculation it'd be ok….It's the 'evidence for' which slipped in that's wrong.
@sungrazercomets Blame the journalists for biting.
@sungrazercomets I feel a bit sorry for the @RoyalAstroSoc on this one. Talk was accepted - what are they supposed to do  further review?
Follow @DrJoVian for the real comet news from #NAM2015. Exciting results from @philae_ptolemy - my guess is breakdown of larger molecules…
@msbentley @philae_ptolemy @guardian @independent 'Leading' not 'Top' researchers this time. Sigh.
@exmamaku @ras_outreach @drjovian @adamrutherford @royalastrosoc It's a talk  this afternoon. I missed it on the program.
@tomkerss Right  but no science in safe mode
@davidgalvin9 I'm so sorry. It was the pressure that did it.
@ericloyd @unknownsymmetry We don't know.
@unknownsymmetry Yes  but not sure that means it was primary cause…
@cosmic_carol If it was off course.
@mrtommyb Yes! Completely agreed. We're £50 but I'm hideously embarrassed by that.
Just catching up with this - good on @space_mog for having the guts to change her mind : http://t.co/WyksifEELg
@monkleyg No idea! Try @BBCStargazing
@michaelaye @henrymance @ARothNYT in a restaurant?

@Bliadhnaichean @BBCStargazing @Philae2014 @ESA_Rosetta Program is being reedited - this is extra
@sikaheimo @BBCStargazing @Philae2014 @AstroEmz @ESA_Rosetta Both.
@ed_davies @mggtTaylor sorry  made a mess of this! Matt is right  of course
@dstndstn @GeertHub @aallan @davidwhogg Weirdly the lack of time is an @esa thing. We decided to echo the team's use but agree it's odd
@dstndstn @GeertHub @aallan Sure. There's an implied time unit.
@dstndstn @GeertHub @aallan I think that's the accumulated power available.
@dallascampbell which reminds me - here's Observatory Pinafore http://t.co/2atTdTkP7A
@ProfMike_M Definitely. Turns out everything is solved
@aallan Stuck with @united so far  but as I'm in Chicago less that may not make much sense…
@aallan Have they got worse again?
@IndrayaniG @dallascampbell @Dr_Lucie Four! But who's counting? Thanks for all your help
@PenguinGalaxy I've read that your mate Cecilia was fond of puns - have you come across any examples?
@gsnarayan @EmExAstris @LSST Of course. But that's not great for @nasa PR.
@EmExAstris @gsnarayan I'm worried about JWST for this reason. As it's 'Hubble's successor' people will expect pretty pictures
@eteq Happy to give advice if needed.
@laurheth @gsnarayan Recent @royalastrosoc survey gives a slightly different picture on LGBT (though not all good) http://t.co/KyelPkb0Jm
.@dallascampbell So looking forward to #bbcsciencezone top trumps. Been training with Sir Norman... http://t.co/ulpeJpPfmS
@kevinschawinski @ngc3314 That's an incredibly hard problem. It's the need to find not only testable but interesting hypotheses that's tough
@FitzsimmonsAlan which one?
@alisonatkin @hannahdev He didn't have approval from his university's ethics board  so wasn't allowed access to raw data.
@royalastrosoc @stephenserjeant @kevinschawinski We asked for the first ever @galaxyzoo paper and were pointed to an acknowledgement.
@AdrianSpalinky I suspect it makes no sense without my words...
@shaka_lulu @github Every time anyone says that at a scientific meeting @arfon drinks.
@gsnarayan @caseyjlaw @ebellm Do we really have scalability problems  though? What's maximum use (minus citizens) - a few hundred people?
@shaka_lulu I’d wondered what that noise was…
@unknownsymmetry Nonsense  almost certainly - see https://t.co/ZwnKycemlr and links therein.
@alisonkestrel @kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @kejames @doctorzen @eye_wire http://t.co/4oCv2F9280 is the paper you're thinking of.
@JLGalache did you find beer?
Hearing about the Supernova Exchange  led me to this as the second hit on Google : http://t.co/SPjGgSJjNo #hotwiredIV cc @shaka_lulu
@sondy @gsnarayan @minorplanetctr Didn't catch - a small fraction  anyway (though an important one).
@andreawiggins @vanhyningv Well  I'd argue that that would have been a better goal than whatever these activities are about.
@spaceyliz 'braincrack' - avoiding building the possible because of the love of thinking about the perfect.
.@andreawiggins Citizen science is exciting to me precisely because of the potential to change people's relationship to science. #crowdcon
@jim_salmons @andreawiggins @tjowens I don't think we're disagree about much  except that I see few truly 'easy' wins (&amp; in truth few wins)
@jim_salmons @andreawiggins @tjowens I'm more worried funders will push for complexity before we've sorted the basics. #crowdcon
@spaceyliz A majority of @oxfordphysics Astrophysics DPhil students participated in @the_zooniverse while at school  too...
@spaceyliz Self-report - ~80% of volunteers seek out more scientific content after participation.
@andreawiggins @jim_salmons @tjowens …entry level task then good scaffolding for further use &amp; inquiry. 3/3 #crowdcon
@andreawiggins @jim_salmons @tjowens …those who aren't ready to think of themselves as scholars. Ideal project has easy… #crowdcon 2/3
@andreawiggins @jim_salmons @tjowens I don't agree.If you don't start with a simple  convincing  authentic task then you lose… #crowdcon 1/3
@jegpeek @reneehlozek I read that hashtag as something to do with @joezuntz
@andreawiggins Sure. But platforms for non-software people are needed. Happy with plural!
@andreawiggins Or building a system so people can get going themselves….
@andreawiggins Well  it's not project directories that people want. It's technical info &amp; help. We are overwhelmed by people wanted to chat
@andreawiggins And as soon as someone funds a couple of members of staff for community outreach we'd be happy to help #crowdcon
@megschwamb Weeks.
@susan_snowy Sadly not - real world gets in the way. Have fun!
How many bits of the sadly destroyed CLUSTER satellites are around the world? Here's @msslspacelab's cc @mggtTaylor http://t.co/VBp06GKruH
@GeertHub in my opinion projects need to set out to solve specific problems. Generalise too early and you will get lost...
I stand corrected! (&amp; yes  Lurking at @msslspacelab today) RT @PlanetAndrewC: @mggtTaylor @Dr_Lucie comet-solar wind interaction  from 1986!
@jen_gupta you're in Oxford?
@drarnakarick @SciBry No website but proceedings soon. Shout (chris@zooniverse.org) if you’d like to talk about code for your workshop.
@karenlmasters @scibry @jen_gupta There is a cocktail bar with an excellent selection of gin en route to dinner.
@DClaphamFRAS @Tim_O_Brien nonsense. Have you read the other manifestos? Also  how would UKIP replace EU FP7 funding?
@DClaphamFRAS @Tim_O_Brien right  and the universities fund that with what? Harry Potter magic?
@kwwillett @robertcnichol I sort of wish he’d left at that point  job done. (Not really  Bob  nice to see you) #kavlicitsci
@RobertMMassey @Tim_O_Brien Absolutely. Would be a nightmare.
@tim_o_brien Ask them - I was interested that intense mockery of their plan to build a British Space Shuttle caused a change.
@megschwamb First we must proceed  but yes  I hope so #kavlicitsci
Change of focus today : the future of astronomical citizen science at #kavlicitsci w. @SciBry  @robertcnichol  @KarenLMasters et al
@cain_rob I'm not sure that's right. We can derive estimates of uncertainty from the range of responses so don't need 'I don't know's
@jen_gupta Absolutely. Maybe come up to Oxford sometime next month?
@ferrarif50lover to be fair to @megschwamb and @lcjohnso the abuse was mostly mine. I have to work tomorrow though...
@AdlerPlanet They're definitely stable. The question is whether the disk from which it formed could have been stable - that's the mystery.
@AdlerPlanet there are some low res simulations but I hope someone is doing it properly. Would be great to watch it form.
@albertfeynman Don't ruin the punchline! (Actually - answer is 'sort of  maybe')
@geerthub Are you allowed to distribute that?
@demitrimuna I've asked - they said 'It hasn't been through the NASA Open Source Process so isn't  and might not be'.
@jonathansick @geerthub @astrofrog On the other hand  if surveys hosted their images &amp; data on S3 or equivalent anyone could use them.
@geerthub Does AWS not have a good solution?
@BenneHolwerda looked Cambridge blue to me...

@FitzsimmonsAlan Nice work!
@cosmos4u what's the problem?
@robmliddell @mggttaylor Rob  are you spending the day following @bbcstargazing vicariously on Twitter? Sure we could use you…
Morning all! Lots of excitement from the @bbcstargazing about our http://t.co/fZavf7hnob discoveries from last night. More data coming…
@corvaxia We're back. Some wobbles but we're doing better than last year!
@blobrana Should be back now!
@the_cardman @bbcstargazing @bbcskyatnight Depends how many more stories Buzz has…
I love that @bbcstargazing now has @Dr_Lucie and @dallascampbell as well as the usual suspects!

@bulletford Yep  see you there
@SarahScience1 @statto @BBCStargazing Yes  and we hope to extend this to the whole sky. This is just a first go
Off to @BBCStargazing via @bbcoxford. Don't forget to send us your Orion pictures! http://t.co/XtxkrUvHaz
@aallan I've been wondering that too…
@astronomyblog @megschwamb @BBCStargazing in theory  Friday morning. But the more processing we can do early the better!
@paulknightley Thank you. Can you upload to the @bbcstargazing Flickr group so our software can grab it?
@geerthub We'll see what happens. It's very much an experiment (on a prime time TV show!)
@cosmos4u @bbcstargazing Any  and all. Yes.
A reminder that we need pictures of Orion for @BBCStargazing - thousands of images needed  and they don't have to be great in themselves.
@this_is_the_sea @bbcstargazing Definitely not.
@davidbflower @bbcstargazing That's the idea!
@dawnsunrise1 Nope  anywhere will do.
@unknownsymmetry @dawnsunrise1 Upload to the Stargazing group on Flickr : (Link here: http://t.co/XtxkrUe6j1
@dawnsunrise1 The more up to date the better  but if you can get us started with your archive ones that'll do nicely.
@fabulousmrg  @sarahcruddas We would only find aliens that were more technically advanced than us. At least a century. #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas It's a PRIVILEGE to be able to work on a really big question ... are we alone. Bye all. #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute It's exploration. Societies that don't explore  don't last very long. #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas Well  better than my high school chums. But they might be machine intelligence. I think that's likely. #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas A cup of coffee says ... within two decades! Prepare thyself! #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas Believe it or not  easiest might be Saturn's moon Enceladus! #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas @thehighfrontier One thing it doesn't cover is interstellar colonization. Maybe the Klingons have an empire. #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas Of course  no one can afford to check out ALL those places  sadly.  #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute Check out Mars  Europa  Enceladus  Titan  Ganymede  and Callisto.  I doubt you'll come up dry. #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas @Jahrtt In my opinion  we've looked at too few star systems. Gotta cover more territory ... #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute And then we'd build bigger antennas to look for a message. #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute The first thing that happens is that our parking lot would be jammed by TV trucks! #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas @iamandyhilton One-third of the public thinks they're visiting Earth.  Highly controversial. #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas @thehighfrontier Hah! Good question. Everyone does their own thing.  Not a bad approach for exploration. #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas @iamandyhilton We try eavesdropping on radio signals. If we find 'em  we'd try to understand the message. #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute If we're alone  we're a MIRACLE.  Scientists are wary of miracles. #spacediscovery
@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute There are 100 000 trillion planets. Not likely all are sterile. #spacediscovery

@ElevenPointTwo @amytoast @Apple @itserikadassit I’m on a 6 something. But also laptop -notice this change in attitude in all their products

@plutosavior @planetarysci I don't know if it was recorded. I can send you my slides if you want.
@AdamFrank4 That’s some good guidance!
@samooja @elakdawalla a couple of missions are under consideration...
@AdamFrank4 I got a parental lecture at about that age: reading too much sci fi  not enough other stuff...
@omcintyre @Slate less than a blip in the cosmic scheme (one hopes...)
@UpportunityU great!
@heathermg cool!
@UpportunityU 12/13 at Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science!
@Paleophile @bobcorrigan @Laelaps @edyong209 @kirkenglehardt @JanFreedman @AlongsideWild  “All you can do is do what you must” - Dylan
BRIEFING: Societal Implications of #Astrobiology: Research from Library of Congress - This Friday w me &amp; @nccomfort https://t.co/d6Lm4ti75J
@DrMRFrancis here’s some nice live Monk from 1959. (not sure if behind paywall? cause I’m a member of site) https://t.co/k6xvgefqPG
New story on human-neanderthal hybrids similar 2 what @Paleophile wrote about here https://t.co/dvA0KTQXSq  &amp; here… https://t.co/DhrMoXjRt1
@omcintyre Yes me too - its been years but such a memorable experience! (My best sighting was in Alaska)
@omcintyre yeah  no kidding!
@nccomfort @barbkiser https://t.co/EQYRf0DNv2
@Babydok123 wow.
@TomChivers @SlagOffTwits yes I was approaching same conclusion... (But not the *old* sense  hanging out under bridges...)
@barbkiser @nccomfort indeed! A genre I love but in small "doses"...
@SlagOffTwits @TomChivers @ClimateOfGavin I don't think you've read Lovelock's last few books.
@TomChivers @SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin indeed I thought that's what we were discussing.
@barbkiser @nccomfort yes preposterous. Some scenes are quite fun but it was hard to watch whole thing!
@TomChivers @SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin he was visionary when developed "geophysiology" before began high amplitude futurology oscillation
@barbkiser @nccomfort yes  that was brilliant. But the film is  um  uh  hmmm....
@SlagOffTwits have you read his books?
@SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin @TomChivers no neither extreme is helpful. "We are certainly doomed" and "no problem at all" from same person?
@SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin @TomChivers mind you this is after his hugely important and valuable career as I stated in my first comment.
@SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin @TomChivers No the problem is radical inconsistency with a seeming commitment only to flouting mainstream view
@barbkiser @nccomfort weirdest film Groucho appeared in: Skidoo https://t.co/dNnXY3bj3o
@SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin @TomChivers He can’t decide in which direction he wants to break ranks so he keeps switching extremes.
@barbkiser @nccomfort Almost the right order here... https://t.co/jeEF28Jwju
@moodyengineer I believe @JillBidenVeep was referring to this:   https://t.co/gIo9O0W3MG   https://t.co/xUF01NOmbo
@iyzie @asrivkin @DarkandWondrous @chrislhayes @NateSilver538 yes
@iyzie @asrivkin @DarkandWondrous @chrislhayes @NateSilver538 close margins in some swing states. Pence reassures those who want actual r
@iyzie @asrivkin @DarkandWondrous @chrislhayes @NateSilver538 obviously but they are competing for those Rs wondering if they can vote Trump
@asrivkin @DarkandWondrous @chrislhayes I think @NateSilver538 just nailed it: Pence setting himself up to win debate &amp; lose post debate.
@asrivkin @DarkandWondrous @chrislhayes true. &amp; @JoyAnnReid just pointed out  Pence may be running for 2020
@DarkandWondrous @asrivkin @chrislhayes that may be it. Cause Kaine is not doing well if he's trying to seem more presidential.
@AstroCook @AscendingNode Kaine is obviously winning if you listen. But losing if you watch. Which is more important.
@DrMRFrancis It’s a fantastic quote from a true genius!
@DrMRFrancis Except for those who are consciously! (great quote from Monk)
@Mad_Science_Guy In this context it was “interesting”.
@Paladin1969 @brianwolven @seanmcarroll @asrivkin I feel bad for my original assumption. Yet I see that sentiment (non sarcastically) often!
@brianwolven @asrivkin @seanmcarroll All cat videos boil down to a few goofy yet furry moves. Amiright?
@brianwolven @asrivkin now I am defending @seanmcarroll against those complaining to me his sarcasm is misplaced!
@brianwolven @seanmcarroll @asrivkin seems a valuable signifier  as this conversation indicates!
@AdamFrank4 @JoelAchenbach Never say never but yes that could hide the biospheric richness of the cosmos for a long time!
@AdamFrank4 @JoelAchenbach should be some w "internal biospheres" but on those world's with air would they not betray themselves?
@AdamFrank4 @JoelAchenbach interesting idea. We are profoundly ignorant about relationship between planets &amp; life!
@dsfpspacefl1ght @tedstryk @JoelAchenbach yes and yes!
@dsfpspacefl1ght @JoelAchenbach Earth is deeply altered by life. More than 2/3 of minerals are biogenic. N  S  C cycles etc. Living world.
@nourtra00456201 me neither!!
@dsfpspacefl1ght @JoelAchenbach europa promising because of geophysical vigor: black smokers  tidal energy etc. Mars  geologically is dead.
@dsfpspacefl1ght @JoelAchenbach life on earth depends upon geological vigor. My hunch Mars is dead. But I support search to test hypothesis!
@dsfpspacefl1ght @JoelAchenbach most of earth history atmosphere participated in life &amp; life was a widely globalized phenomenon.
@Paleophile 👍🚀🌗👽
@Paleophile tempting!
@wormhole_raider @ThomsonJared @AdamFrank4 anen
@ThomsonJared @AdamFrank4 @NPR @Revkin yes. Good thing we aren't viruses!
@ThomsonJared @AdamFrank4 @NPR @Revkin viruses do not discuss their potential futures. Humans have learned &amp; reinvented themselves in past.
@ThomsonJared @AdamFrank4 @NPR @Revkin depends on the asteroid  and on our choices.
#Astrobiology of the #Anthropocene by @AdamFrank4 at NPR 13.7  with nice shout out for #EarthInHumanHands https://t.co/0iQcIKf1Qs
@ThomsonJared @AdamFrank4 @NPR @Revkin yes there's a long history of catastrophic changes - but nothing like us has happened here before.
@DrMRFrancis @GeoSciTweeps machines will be better at this than we are  once they take over.
@GeoSciTweeps @DrMRFrancis Ooops!  I am terrified that I am going to turn in a column and later realize I already wrote it 3 years ago.
@DrMRFrancis Ever find yourself wondering if you’ve already written a piece or just imagined it? That happens to me w my Sky &amp; Tel columns.
@TrueSciPhi curious how u decide who is a writer or scientist or both? (thx)
@thomassturm @Robotbeat @chrisadams2112 I am optimistic that his schedule is optimistic by at least a decade.
@thomassturm @Robotbeat @chrisadams2112 yes  this is a paradox. There is no way to be completely careful. Nobody knows what is enough...
@Robotbeat @chrisadams2112 @Slate you should see the piece I just wrote for @SkyandTelescope ...
@call_him_bob @NatureAstronomy Hard to say  but judging from craters there was always a wide range of sizes.
@SLaBouchardiere Well  it IS scary… but not by any means hopeless!
@GeoSciTweeps mine too! My 2 best pals from grad school  though we were growed up post-docs by Neptune...
Check out the great recent tweets from @GeoSciTweeps with insights &amp; ideas about planetary exploration past &amp; future https://t.co/JcgPktAxsg
@GeoSciTweeps those were the days...!
@AllPlanets ha ha whoops I meant GSA
@CraftLass @tim846 I live in DC but get to NYC a lot. May be there for week or 2 soon to record audiobook of EARTH IN HUMAN HANDS...
@CraftLass @tim846 ah unfortunately have to fly to DC in the AM tomorrow... :-/
@plutosavior that could work. The Naval Observatory looks like a cool place to live...
@ElevenPointTwo @TheEarthStory 100 is the new 50...
@Sr_Tresillo @alexwitze no! Planet name came first!
@CraftLass @tim846 👍👍🚀🚀🎶🎶
@tim846 @CraftLass sounds good to me!
@ClimateOfGavin @TheEarthStory yes &amp; we know the density very well &amp; therefore more or less the composition.
@TheEarthStory @ClimateOfGavin yes. &amp; Possible local residual impact heat around Tombaugh Regio?
@ClimateOfGavin @TheEarthStory mostly radioactive decay.
@carolynporco @JaneGoodallInst Yes indeed she is a shining example. And also very lovely in person.
@PlanetDr @chrisgeidner pfffff
@CruzTruckseries often appallingly bad. The most amazing stories &amp; discoveries but little ability to connect. Ever try watching NASA TV? Zzz
@hansolofsven it seems to be there...
@PlanetDr I'll miss it too cause I'll be on a flight  so I posted my reaction yesterday. 😬
@hansolofsven @Peter_Grinspoon long as there are no Klingons!
@numinouscosmos @JaneGoodallInst Yup! And she kissed me!
@carolynporco @numinouscosmos My mind is going.  I can feel it  Dave...
@carolynporco @numinouscosmos with CP playing the role of HAL9000
@kejames No. (Can't imagine) and Yes. (she is!)
@Summer_Ash @DrMRFrancis go see Queen of Katwe. It's great &amp; theaters will be uncrowded!
@VealSlab thanks we had a very talented sound engineer mixing &amp; recording.
@VealSlab ha - love the running commentary!
@VealSlab cool!
@VealSlab 👍🎶🚀🌍🌗🌛✨☄🎸🎲
@VealSlab thanks brother!
@VealSlab trip to the sun!!  https://t.co/M9JVgdz6AO
@cluckeryDuckery @aravosis Great question. I wish I knew and knew how to push back.
@carolynporco @FolkertWierda @GerardoBarbosa @neiltyson do Deep Impact mission along the way -throwing a slug into a comet to measure splash
@carolynporco @FolkertWierda @GerardoBarbosa @neiltyson CP you will have a blast re-reading. You know they go to Saturn not Jupiter &amp; they
@carolynporco @FolkertWierda @GerardoBarbosa @neiltyson Yes &amp; the book of 2001 also has some great stuff not in the film!
@scorrice Yes! Packing and unpacking  while basically a pain  has its joyful little surprises...
@TheEarthStory neither extreme is viable given the data. If all gradually there would be more partially embayed craters  palimpsests  etc.
@FolkertWierda @carolynporco @GerardoBarbosa @neiltyson the book is wonderful too. Lots of cool stuff that didn't make it into the film.
@sondy opponents of METI will be pleased...
@sondy meaning it can receive but not transmit?
@sondy Why that is Buckaroo Banzai - Nuclear Physicist  Brain Surgeon and Rock Star!!!
@PlanetDr Yes we cannot hide our inner natures!
@LarryNittler makes sense to me.
@PlanetDr Nice!
@numinouscosmos best to always be prepared…
@Paladin1969 uh oh...
@DavidBflower :-)
@JeffMakos1 that is certainly one possibility!
@AussiePhinatic Landsat multi spectral image of a delta infrared represented  as color I believe.
@MelissaJPeltier @robert3242 @GreenSkyDeb @rsoventile @LScullyArts @GottaLaff have a great one!
@TheEarthStory @geolizzy @alexwitze @asrivkin Tuesday is more promising for me!
@TheEarthStory Unfortunately I don’t get into town til Monday!
@JeffMakos1 @MoonZappa All hail Bill!
@MeghnaWBUR some strange resonance phenomenon that emerges from the planet-scale swirling!
@ChrisDudley85 @thefooleryoftom @AstroKatie stop
@soledadobrien are you on the Jefferson Airplane?
@coreyspowell @SarahEFecht @PeterDEdmonds yes!
@SarahEFecht @PeterDEdmonds that's a really good idea!
@pensgooner @PeterDEdmonds @SarahEFecht it is a fine line...
@pensgooner @PeterDEdmonds @SarahEFecht Well it *does* generate a lot of interest in their press conf. &amp; the speculation doesn’t really hurt
@PsychSailor @AstrobiologyTop Agreed!!
@Annaleen Clearly!
@Annaleen I cannot Parse that abstract.
@call_him_bob https://t.co/C1k9zPCtKt
@Ghroznak I think it's more the remnants of the stellar explosion that created this nebula.
@Wildlebendes I was actually thinking of writing something on it...
@atomcluborg happy to sign one - both hard copy &amp; ebook out on 12/6!!
@Robotbeat @SLaBouchardiere arguably that alone would make us something very different...
@ClimateOfGavin @jamesannan @RachelFeltman yes exactly.
@atomcluborg coming soon: pub date is Dec 6th on all platforms!!!
@docdailey what we’ve learned about life since Sagan arguably pushes probabilities upward - extremophiles...
@docdailey we have no basis to say that. We really don’t know.
@docdailey until natural explanation its fun to speculate. There is a peer reviewed literature of such predictions by very smart scientists.
@mustapipa @docdailey I mean how do you feel about possible biosignatures? could make exact same critique. Fairy tale. Must be natural exp.
@mustapipa @docdailey It fits a prediction in an interesting way. Not unjustified if carefully qualified  which it was in published paper.
@docdailey @mustapipa History goes to Freeman Dyson  Carl Sagan  Frank Drake  etc. All said was *possible* &amp; unlikely in any specific case.
@docdailey @mustapipa I was referring to @mustapipa who claims to know what is possible and impossible &amp; ridicules other scientists.
@mustapipa @docdailey “don’t consider it likely”. Neither do I. But there is a literature of such predictions and reasonable to examine.
@mustapipa @docdailey Unless you have special knowledge of what kind of evolution is permitted elsewhere. Did you get from a stone tablet?
@mustapipa @docdailey you could say same about a possible biosignature. Responsible to consider it but require more evidence.
@docdailey @mustapipa if assumption is it can't ever be life  then you will never find it.
@docdailey @mustapipa yes but reasonable to discuss possible bio signatures. &amp; possible techno signatures.
@Paleophile ha!
Oh yeah #mars is freaky beautiful. @hirise https://t.co/Qqk0OCNlaS

@Paleophile Yes. I have noticed. They should have invited @betulland @Sara_Imari among others...
@ChrisDudley85 yes
@Paleophile yup!
@Paleophile Nice!
@kejames @nccomfort more generally he was saying “out with the old” ideas...
@David_Dobbs @nccomfort @kejames Quote was from his talk right now - live tweeting..

Got RNA World? @nccomfort at #LifeEmerges https://t.co/ZMIEaaMY5D
@RedShirtOne as @nccomfort explained  in terms of old &amp; new ideas “the soup is out the window"
Now @nccomfort is elaborating on the defenestration of the primordial soup. #LifeEmerges
"The soup is out the window" @nccomfort on revolution in origin of life ideas. #Lifeemerges
@Paleophile yeah I'm stuck n traffic. Good thing my talk is in afternoon...
@johnhawks @vox @B_resnick also @Paleophile has written about this in @SAPIENS_org https://t.co/dvA0KU8yJY
@rappolee glad to hear it!
@michaelaranger @BmoreDavy BBC crew I worked w had running joke "something only a Discovery Channel producer would believe" yetis &amp; such
@michaelaranger @BmoreDavy and very formulaic. I can't really watch any recent American science TV. Some BBC stuff is good.
Great StarTalk AllStars with @Starkeystardust &amp; @chucknicecomic @mggtTaylor cool show guys!! https://t.co/HdXmiAe9w0
@StarTalkRadio @BeaconTheatre @neiltyson @EugeneMirman @carolynporco @seanonolennon @vanessabayer @michaelianblack great line-up!
@JosephVoros @DrMRFrancis peer pressure is strong on Twitter!
@DrMRFrancis @JosephVoros god damn them all to hell!! Oh wait - wrong film...
@michaelaranger @BmoreDavy tell me about it :-/
@DrMRFrancis @JosephVoros I think I know some apes who have...
@JosephVoros @DrMRFrancis true even on Earth  given tool use by some animals. Still its a pretty good substitution for many purposes...
@drspacejunk hey you engaged w that nasty pseudo - intellectual misogynist troll longer than I could.  Thanks...
@arielwaldman Lovely. Congrats!
@arielwaldman @gwmck @OpticalSociety @AstroKatie @SarcasticRover @DrShaena Yes - its going to be big!
@gwmck @OpticalSociety @AstroKatie @SarcasticRover @DrShaena Cool!
@sarahcottentail phew!!
@saveabee @MikeMongo oh well...
@IbnulHussaini on Mars co2 would start to condense even as atmos heated up. Venus would cool but prob not enough for H2O. Devil in details!
@IbnulHussaini good question. Answer is indeed more complex because both would immediately start to evolve &amp; adjust
@IbnulHussaini ??
@DavidBflower @KellieRoseWick @NewHorizons2015 yes. "We'll be back" !!
@cluckeryDuckery @StarTalkRadio yes! Welcome to the future!
@drspacejunk @Astroguyz https://t.co/bDPJMsUOHe
@AussiePhinatic @NewHorizons2015 it will visit another small recently discovered object on New Years Day 2019!
@sciencequiche @mirikramer yeah those shots are amazing.
@brianwolven @ziyatong yeah  that or nuke war.
@omcintyre @BigHistoryPro @BigHistoryInst @davidgchristian @EliseBohan @JosephVoros yes  so many great talks!
@hansolofsven Yeah  mine too!
@tomangell @KurtGegenhuber @pbump Yes. His definitive story has not been written. *Some* of it is in those papers...
@JulieKlam @likaluca Same. I know  but can’t say!
.@KurtGegenhuber @pbump I should also add *unsung*. Her role largely missing from published biographies to date. (3/n)
.@KurtGegenhuber @pbump Arden was Sagan's uber-competent  loyal  indefatigable assistant  protector &amp; secret weapon during his rise. (2/2)
.@KurtGegenhuber @pbump Hammarskjöld’s exec assistant at UN was the amazing Shirley Arden. She was hired by Carl Sagan at Cornell &amp; (1/2)
@KurtGegenhuber Yes  which I appreciate.
@PlanetDr Glad to hear it!
@KurtGegenhuber @pbump do you know the connection between him &amp; Carl Sagan?
@KurtGegenhuber @pbump yes.
.@alexwitze @HopeJahren @deborahblum @Emma_Marris Holy nonfiction Batman that is some great company to be in. Thanks!!
Wow  nice mention for EARTH IN HUMAN HANDS  from @alexwitze esp. given the other books in this list - great company! https://t.co/n6DOyG7Umf
@call_him_bob yes eventually but we've got some work to do!
@GerardoBarbosa @bdorminey to some degree  perhaps. But there is a substantial atmosphere above this level that would absorb a lot.
@Paleophile @SAPIENS_org good stuff!
@Paleophile wow this is great!

@Paleophile yes. I have a large framed print of voyager image of Jupiter. But not this one w Io.
@dan_anger thx - great to see you.
@POOetryman @JimJlr2 @KellieRoseWick both
@JimJlr2 @POOetryman @KellieRoseWick yes Dyson sphere wouldn't behave like that. some other structure? Ringworld or multiple constructions?
@POOetryman @KellieRoseWick yes a second one.
@JeffMakos1 @MoonZappa praise be!
@hansolofsven quite possibly!
@hansolofsven maybe.
@hansolofsven yes I think so  but until we have an explanation everything is on the table.
@awgonnerman @TomLevenson Yes!!
@PutoAstronauta yup
@awgonnerman @TomLevenson your experience here is more relevant than my degrees. I did read that  but I’m no expert...
@awgonnerman @TomLevenson apparently it is not uncommon to see an avian radar signal like this at the dawn.
@DaveBngDave @capitalweather @MrsWheelbarrow no it was extraordinary!
@dePlantagenet @PeterDEdmonds “I want to hear the scream of the butterfly!” - Jim Morrison
@PeterDEdmonds yes its worth pointing out that these are not the same as pressure waves. But beyond that analogy is pretty good.
@SJRogue @michaelaranger Yes.
@michaelaranger the bottom of the sea. But first: Are you experienced?
@michaelaranger yes. Exactly. “If you can just get your mind together then come along with me. We’ll hold hands and watch the sun rise from
@Richardhurst19 yes. It seems to be active. We need new missions to determine for sure &amp; how active.
@EricFielding @Eaterofsun @DKeithClimate @KenCaldeira @Revkin @GernotWagner @dotearth If they had a space program we could ask them.
@EricFielding @Eaterofsun @DKeithClimate @KenCaldeira @Revkin @GernotWagner @dotearth How do u know? they didn’t have cities or write books
@lyndalovon @KenCaldeira @ClimateBook @dotearth Ugh! Why’d you have to bring *him* into this?
@mggtTaylor @ESA_Rosetta Tricky  and exciting. You are doing great work. We are watching and appreciating!
@verbiscer @volcanopele @asrivkin John has the best memory of anyone I know. So he’s probably right.
@Science_Hooker Love it! Also this: https://t.co/yGS9azxOzw
@Annaleen wow! Now I too am “inspired” by your browsing history...
@verbiscer @asrivkin Legend!
@verbiscer @asrivkin is that gene Shoemaker behind Buck?
@asrivkin @verbiscer &amp; Kargel  Buck Janes  Basilevsky...
@verbiscer love it!!
@Summer_Ash @LDMay they are better? Good to know.
@LDMay @Summer_Ash sweet!
@LDMay @Summer_Ash I do miss the legroom when I fly. &amp; the upgrades. Oh  wait...
@Summer_Ash @LDMay I actually *lost* my Premier status this year. Which if you think about it  is a significant lifestyle upgrade.
@PlanetDr @LDMay yes  true. &amp; I complain w the best (or worst of em) But sometimes we forget how privileged we are (&amp; must seem 2 others)
@Planetguy_Bln @airfrance good point!
@AussiePhinatic ask away &amp; Ill respond if I can. Also my Venus book is pretty good  and mostly up to date. https://t.co/m8MdRS38u1
@IbnulHussaini yeah  really not smart.
@AussiePhinatic only in my head.. 
@Valgren6 @asrivkin @jtuttlekeane @UALPL @Mikey_Nolan @smallplanets I love that picture even though I'm a bit flat in it. What a crew!
@PutoAstronauta @StarTalkRadio yes we are going to do some more episodes!
@PutoAstronauta Phew!!
@PutoAstronauta Which 2???
@DrMRFrancis They are thrilling! Glad you’re going. Wish I was…
@DrMRFrancis No. Should be  but… work.
Um  so this is #Mars! &amp; there are LOTS of incredible new pics in this @HiRISE catalog update https://t.co/InMHqV8qmA https://t.co/JqVXsa2hAa
@DavidBflower yes!
@mousegle yes. Chilling.
@numinouscosmos @carolynporco @VealSlab All of the above?
@carolynporco @VealSlab yeah divine revelation would be great if it worked  but...
@VealSlab @carolynporco That would be living hell!
@carolynporco There’s even this - from 4.1 (!!) But  I dunno. Hadean  not a nice place  wouldn’t want to live there https://t.co/HQkqNFwHnK
@AdamFrank4 Yes @MGleiser is a wonderful writer!
@rappolee @carolynporco good question. T tolerance found  not sure if there are markers for P
@carolynporco Yes. Very cool if it holds up! Some already put earliest evidence at 3.8 from isotopes but fossils more concrete (or rocky!)
@Paleophile @mattrussell_PhD @TeagWall shows how much I know.
@carolynporco Life may have arisen at ocean vent.  LUCA = thermophile. Date of last ocean-evaporator unknown. So - a range of possibility.
@mattrussell_PhD @TeagWall maybe @paleophile ?
@EllenStofan your other home town?
@planetjuneberry @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson :-)
@codydschultz @HiRISE in part optical illusion - I believe little landslides going down the opposite slope. There’s a paper on it -must find
@codydschultz @HiRISE Yes!!! Weird freeze-thaw  landslide structures near the south pole...
@WeiPoints @hannahjwaters @SmithsonianMag Cool!
@Peter_Grinspoon @GerardoBarbosa I’m as free as a Spoonbird now...
@ECroydon :-) Thx!
@GerardoBarbosa @Peter_Grinspoon yeah  it is up there.
@alexwitze @roseveleth @ffwdpod @PlanetDr @AllPlanets @CarlyHowett OK  I don’t know if I’m the weirdest  but I have been called strange...
@MarsMaven @SkyandTelescope Good find!

@tim846 @BBCNewshour can’t wait to have you read it &amp; know what you think…!
@ozaed probably  but worth checking out if only to rule out.
@QuakeAlarmMex I hope you like it!
@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames we need a Ramones version!
@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames group hug?
@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames while we're being civil  I apologize for snarky "7 sins" comment. Based on headline only. Undeserved
@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames thank you.
@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames is indeed interesting info but headline &amp; intro slightly misleading or clickbaity is all.
@brianwolven thank you for sharing that.
@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames Not good metric: these are all conflated &amp; species loss is only one (important) measure of severity.
@mattrussell_PhD @kejames @canislatrans yes. Silly. "Let's rank the 7 deadly sins! Click here to see what's worse than murder!"
@roselique party planet!
@Robotbeat yes. A more honest world...
@sandygrains Yes! Terrible twos would be over in weeks  teenagers would only be annoying for a month  &amp; everybody would get wise fast!!
@evandawson @AdamFrank4 if I had to guess  it's easier to survive in the game. Though I confess I haven't visited either world yet...
@numinouscosmos Can’t wait to hear what you think!
@Paladin1969 can't wait till it's out &amp; you can!
@nccomfort @KlugeCtr @carlzimmer can't wait!
@prezcannady @Robotbeat that sucks - Sunday's the best day for Dim sum!
@prezcannady @Robotbeat and I want cookies!!!
@Paladin1969 Oh well yes there’s that but I don’t think they need to worry about puny humans and their pathetic weapons!
@Paladin1969 Absolutely good to realize and recognize our unity through contrast to *actual* aliens...
@nourtra00456201 Yes - some inspiring individuals!
@masequeira1 Yes indeed - nice to be reminded of the possibility. And  one of these days...
@AsteroidEnergy agreed. Needs to be confirmed by other observatories.
@tan123 Nobody thinks that 400 ppm on its own is causing mass extinction. Convergence of habitat loss  climate change   acidification etc.
@Paladin1969 @codydschultz Yes  that worries me a great deal.
@tan123 what the hell? Do you just enjoy attacking scientists and telling them their work is no good? Were you mistreated as a child? Sorry.
@tan123 Interesting question. Any humans anywhere on Earth? Don’t know. Could imagine poles just cool enough to hang on. Need food too.
@BenMakesTV Pub date is December 6.
@tan123 Silly. Willful misinterpretation or great ignorance?
@planetjuneberry @DocAmen for my last book I was interviewed by @nprscottsimon It was a wonderful experience! https://t.co/EHNN7LLUDa
@brianwolven @theothervoices @drfunkyspoon I think u could market such a thing if it wouldn’t mess up microwave or food...
@brianwolven @theothervoices @drfunkyspoon Om eye!!!
@soledadobrien all the way downward dog.
@chrschwaegerl If they’re watching  they know. We’re not exactly subtle...
@HopeJahren @PlanetDr I like “habited” !
@tanyaofmars Congrats!!!!
@milkysa Yay!!!!
@numinouscosmos lovely!
@SANEAlex_ quite possible  but depending on atmospheric properties a lot of heat can be redistributed by weather...
@rboyle31 @TheAtlantic @TrueSciPhi That’s likely true. Unless rogue planets are exoplanets? Even then would have to be lucky!
@GerardoBarbosa see my last tweet...
@agilecoach @PlanetDr maybe even probable in a billion years...
@AdamFrank4 what a cool thought!

@Wikisteff @erleellis @NatureComms yes  we will. The anthropocene concept will help us turn the corner.
@cosmos4u @astrokiwi @coreyspowell @ClimateOfGavin that's ok we'll all tweet details before then!
@astrokiwi @lacalaca85 @ClimateOfGavin I’m just glad I live on a planet in the *coffee* zone!!!
@astrokiwi @lacalaca85 yes  I saw one of those - got me out of bed!!
@sarahcottentail @StarkeyStardust @emilylurice right back atcha Sarah - thanks for making it happen!!
@Richardhurst19 he is a respected colleague. Have not collaborated but have known him for decades!
@Richardhurst19 cool!
@Richardhurst19 Thank YOU!!
@Richardhurst19 yes!! https://t.co/M9JVgdz6AO
@brianwolven good point!
@StarTalkRadio @sarahcottentail Warp factor 7 Captain Cotten!
@Paleophile @BeccaPeixotto @meanlouise @fishinnards yes!
@ChrisDudley85 @washingtonpost don’t ignore what Hansen actually says about this then. He presents this as a hypothetical not a prediction.
@brianwolven @markgurwell @TheEarthStory @LokiVolcano yes &amp; fractionation in Io as water was depleted  differential mineral bonding of H &amp; D
@Paleophile @edyong209 Ya - me too! Lets get a posse for Oct 3.
@markgurwell @brianwolven @TheEarthStory @LokiVolcano May well expect *extreme* fractionation  so consider possibility of lots of HDS...
@nadiamdrake @OSIRISREx Sounds like my flight from Houston to Tucson last night!
@markgurwell @brianwolven @TheEarthStory @LokiVolcano would you be able to get HDS?
@TheEarthStory @brianwolven @LokiVolcano That would be a cool measurement. What is the H containing substance/phase? Is there H2S?
@TheEarthStory @brianwolven @LokiVolcano Possible  but if there was a “least likely world to retain water” award I would nominate Io!
@mattrussell_PhD @mcnees @sgruenwald in astronomy it's often about education  outreach and training
@nourtra00456201 @the_wrangler @sciam @ESAcleanspace Yes!
@morphizm @the_wrangler @sciam Hah - yes!
@planetjuneberry @sciam wow - thanks!
@DrMRFrancis pssshhaawww!
@DrMRFrancis and vice versa
@ElevenPointTwo @batchelorshow Yes.
@Mad_Science_Guy @spacearcheology Run!!!
Heads up: Emergence of Life symposium at @librarycongress 9/15 w me  @nccomfort @carlzimmer @sophiaroosth &amp; others. https://t.co/O3z32Xl6qM
@brianwolven @PlanetDr @sondy @Alex_Parker @elakdawalla @asrivkin Supercritical Flying Acid Squirrels. Saw them open for the Ramones at CBGB
@AdamFrank4 @Revkin @neiltyson I agree. There is no "great silence".
@AdamFrank4 @Revkin @neiltyson Agree with your assessment. Chapter on this in my new book! Intelligent life = sustainable. Otherwise dumb.
@Paleophile True &amp; the list of people I know who've been brutally fired &amp; the smartest most creative &amp; lovely people I know overlap a lot!
@Paleophile yes  and very common in our supposedly enlightened institutions. Pisses me off! But here's to survival! https://t.co/sun7RQm9nh
@Paleophile oh man so sorry you went through that. Museum culture  I've found is so often twisted &amp; disrespectful. Painful to learn this.
@mattkenworthy @MJIBrown @PeterDEdmonds @AstroKatie @EricMamajek yes that's what this is.
@DrMRFrancis @PlanetDr At least there its a dry heat...
@PlanetDr We are stuck in our little terraformed base in DC.
@AstroKatie @PeterDEdmonds agree. Depends on circumstances though. Sometimes embargoes  done in obnoxious ways (esp when combined w hints)
@RichardFPenn @spacearcheology the creatures there think much the same about us with our treacherous seasons and caustic oxygenated air...
@AstroKatie @PeterDEdmonds yes. But apparently well founded.
@rappolee possible planet possibly in the possibly habitable zone.
@ElevenPointTwo no it's sloppy short hand.
@EthonRaptor @ChrisDudley85 @CColose @DrJillStein If you’re interested in being somewhat more up to date start with https://t.co/FbCzV5nE5x
@EthonRaptor @ChrisDudley85 @CColose @DrJillStein That’s 26 yrs out of date. More recent work by @AlanRobock  others confirms nuclear winter
@ChrisDudley85 @EthonRaptor @CColose @DrJillStein Yes some details debated but for most part has held up. Toon's recent review in Phys Today
@ChrisDudley85 @EthonRaptor @CColose @DrJillStein Ha! Mars Ball. Yup.
@ChrisDudley85 @EthonRaptor @CColose @DrJillStein Good example of a very influential paper. I cover that history in depth in my new book.
@ChrisDudley85 @EthonRaptor @DrJillStein @CColose But when we go beyond accepted science do we blunt the case for action? Consensus powerful
@ChrisDudley85 @CColose @DrJillStein Extreme southern ice sheet collapse seems like a real risk over next 1000 to 5000 years.
@AsteroidEnergy @AndyKauffman yeah unless you could react methane with something already there like acetylene
@ChrisDudley85 agree with most in principle  but needs a re-write. Strategic Defense Init was an awful Reagan-era project long abandoned.
@ChrisDudley85 @CColose @DrJillStein true. But 9 ft by 2050? Maybe she meant by 2500?
@AndyKauffman @AsteroidEnergy possible  if you could find a way to burn it without O  or make O cheaply  or react ch4 w acetylene?
@lukedones @marykarrlit @NewYorker man that was good writing. Thanks for putting it out there. Sorry you have to deal w shit like that.
@AndyKauffman @AsteroidEnergy just might not be worth the energy to mine it to bring it elsewhere  as there are other sources.
@tanyaofmars cool!
@dbindsch @MarsMaven @radjanirad @LokiVolcano this is a great story. Have you written it up?
@gregzink @CassiniSaturn @neiltyson @ProfBrianCox absolutely! We were just scheming about that...
@hauck @PlanetDr @DrMRFrancis I mean g. G is probably not low there...
@hauck @PlanetDr @DrMRFrancis I want to go rafting down one of these canyons. Is there turbulence? Imagine doing rapids in that low G.
@AndyKauffman @AsteroidEnergy maybe but that takes energy so depends where you want to use it. Don’t want more hydrocarbons on Earth!
@AndyKauffman @AsteroidEnergy not really because there is no oxygen to burn it…
@PlanetDr @DrMRFrancis yeah at least on a planet with all this damn oxygen. It’s a hazard!
@PlanetDr @DrMRFrancis Hey @jeffreyskargel are you on twitter?  Did you try something like this?
@DrMRFrancis @PlanetDr Somehow I think Jeff Kargel has tried this.
@DrMRFrancis There have been some experiments. Would be fun to try one…
@Mad_Science_Guy meant to include this link! https://t.co/cZweoWSvpC
@majormajor42 @Paladin1969 @CharlesCMann no
.@Paladin1969 @CharlesCMann Yes  it's a dumb idea but point here is someone desperate could try it - so let's avoid that by limiting CO2.
“Planetary Intelligence: Managing Earth’s Future” interesting session at fall meeting of @theAGU  https://t.co/s4yrNy3Uod #anthropocene
@Wildlebendes yes but no good hypothesis yet fits the data.
@Paleophile yes I think so!
@Paleophile Oh crap - probably can’t today - got something at 3 til ?  But yeah we need this!
@DrMRFrancis Yes. He also said “Life is a blur of Republicans and meat"
@DrMRFrancis Good idea!!
@DrMRFrancis OK!
@hauck @amytoast @astromarkmarley @EllenStofan @starstryder @StarzanPlanets honored to share such company!
@numinouscosmos yeah I remember this. Freaky.
@numinouscosmos yes we do :(
@lyndalovon impressive list of signatories.
@radjanirad great detail - thanks!
@lyndalovon whoops - correction. Just learned she was hired as first prof at Vassar https://t.co/bgEZn6TYRl
@lyndalovon Correct. :-(
@mcnees Cool!
@Pillownaut @AlanStern @NASAVoyager @NewHorizons2015 the Saga in Pasadena!
2 years ago with the House Band of the Universe in Chicago before we took @AdlerPlanet into Space!! https://t.co/odylbCKaej
@lukedones @PlanetDr he graduated when oil bust meant no geology jobs  but cheap real estate in LoDo -&gt;brew pub -&gt;fortune -&gt;mayor-&gt;governor
@mousegle @yarotrof @wikileaks who knows how “poll” was conducted and spread? May not mean much but speaks poorly of those who responded...
@mousegle @yarotrof @wikileaks Egos attract?
@AdamFrank4 no time to lose!
@brianwolven @drfunkyspoon Yes I was a fan of wikileaks for a long time. But now they are manipulating and abusing their power.
@numinouscosmos some published abstracts and an unpublished paper that I have in draft form.
@numinouscosmos yeah and probably some literally hiding in my files &amp; boxes. I’m not mr. organized...
@numinouscosmos yes there is something sort of superhuman about it.
@numinouscosmos No I just found em yesterday. Maybe donate them one of these days.
@numinouscosmos He wrote that way. Dictating  in complete flawless sentences. I remember him on the beach writing Cosmos into a tape recorde
@tylerjmetivier thanks! New book coming out in December… (If I don’t spend all my time on Twitter…)
@tylerjmetivier Excellent source of inspiration! When I was a teen remember him walking on beach talking into tape recorder  writing Cosmos!
@heathermg Aaaaahhhhh!!!!!!
@numinouscosmos just posted a bunch more
@girlinalabcoat @NASAAmes Yeah me too. Had good times there and its always great to go back.
@numinouscosmos There’s a bunch more - I’ll post some tomorrow.
@numinouscosmos fun for me reading them too. Could have easily been chucked out as I’m tossing lots of files - glad I found these!
@girlinalabcoat @NASAAmes I was post-docking at Ames w Jim Pollack as my advisor. Pollack had been Sagan’s first student at Harvard.
@numinouscosmos Yes. and yes.
@Paleophile Just found the motherlode! Will tweet some… Throwing out nearly everything but these I will keep!
@ElevenPointTwo None in mine really either - but when I tweeted some anti Trump comments they came out of the woodwork to object...
Congrats to @alexwitze for winning @theAGU David Perlman Award for Excellence in Science Journalism. Well deserved! https://t.co/TDIXHnymNK
@dsfpspacefl1ght @ProfAbelMendez @NewHorizons2015 a very different world. (&amp; we've had a decent look at a hemisphere &amp; glimpse at the rest)
@OmanReagan for me was external recognition- always wanted 2 b writer &amp; scientist but not til PhD &amp;  magazine pub thought of myself as those
@IanAdAstra @AlanStern This defnition values intrinsic properties over orbital location.Could be argued large asteroids &amp; moons ARE planets.
@IanAdAstra @AlanStern A reasonable criterion: if large enough to be round by self gravity (but too small to be a star) it is a planet.
@lyndalovon Thank you!
@numinouscosmos Thanks!
@foresthouse @AwesomeCon @DavaExplorer @BillNye @EugeneMirman @harikondabolu @kingfirestorm Nice. Thanks!
@omcintyre good words!!
@DrMRFrancis I’m game. Listening to it now. Great stuff!
Delightfully strange patterns on Mars from @HiRISE This is what dunes do inside some craters https://t.co/M6R2qM1DJG https://t.co/b6QmLVDPRr
@DrMRFrancis Thanks!
@Babydok123 This is brilliant.
@DrMRFrancis Oh cool - wish I had discovered him earlier. What a treat it was to see him recently.
@DrMRFrancis https://t.co/XG4VwGiKHU  a great album.
@DrMRFrancis Saw him play recently  opening for Johnny Clegg. Really beautiful music.
@Astro_Zach &amp; those amazing shots of MSL entry from MRO.
@Astro_Zach Good idea.
@TimandraHarknes @standupmaths One of these please! https://t.co/NOs1WIh2y3
@erikapal @jckcrll @_Echunia @standupmaths @long_daithi Much fun!
@erikapal @DVDGC13 @jckcrll @long_daithi @SunPyProject O am building up to taking the leap!
@Roy_Astro it could be! I'll know more on Friday as we have a session on that.
@honorharger @m000sh @ArtSciMuseum @BBC @NASA Likewise!
@markmccaughrean Oh dear…
@RogerHighfield Likewise! Great night. I need to come back and have a go on the slides though :)
@CordiScott @UniKentSPS Thanks and great to meet you!
@Cosmologychris @newscilive It was great to meet you and see your incredible images.
@MsNaughtyCheese Thanks for coming!
Sounds like @newscilive has been awesome today! Looking forward to speaking there on Sunday https://t.co/7t9I198J5B
@michelleareeve @standupmaths Likewise! Catch you at @ucl sometime hopefully.
@mozatoffee @popastro @jodrellbank @Tim_O_Brien Thanks for coming!
@hastroparr @jodrellbank Thanks for coming!
@jen_gupta @PSB_HQ Gives me chills every time I listen to it!
@asubsetofdaves @thelabandfield @qsl_deb @jckcrll @DrKimmyRocket @long_daithi @Bright_Point @slyardley I do :)
@sarim0t0 @sciencemuseum @tedxlondon Thanks!
@ArtOfAstronomy @sciencemuseum Very nice :)
@chriscwharris @sciencemuseum We focussed instead on building space instrumentation. My which we have been very successful :)
@thehighfrontier @sciencemuseum Thanks!
@MikeAlphaOne @sciencemuseum Expected orbit lifetime was 100 yrs I think. So  will be up there for a while yet :)
@Roy_Astro @sciencemuseum Info on passes and brightness can be found here: https://t.co/9MZKTWvHyo
@markmccaughrean @mggtTaylor @AstroEmz You guys have all the good stuff!
@asubsetofdaves @NagoyaUniv_info Where can we get one of those t-shirts?!
@mggtTaylor @AstroEmz Happy birthday Emily!
@FitzsimmonsAlan Hope you get a good view on your way in :)
@LiamTEdwards @standupmaths I am far more sensible :)
@jen_gupta Oh no! Hope you get another trip there!
@jen_gupta I caught it on my last day here!
@markmccaughrean Good luck deciding what to do!
@markmccaughrean I am a bit torn. There will probably be a solar physics meeting in Portland - I may drive in from there!
@helen_hm11 @UCL_Academy It has been great escapism - perfect for writing papers!
@suthers Glorious!
@AstroAndyN @standupmaths A perfectly good question :)
@TheRealMike @standupmaths All in the name of science :) P.S. Kangaskhan hasn't been caught yet!
@helen_hm11 @Solarsphere2016 @space2earth Enjoy! I went last year - it is a lovely festival.
@petertgallagher @Hodges_Figgis Always lovely to see it on the shelves!
@Susie__Chan @windsorAndy @michelle_lmc Any time! You have been exceedingly good to us!
@rougol @hackcircus @helenarney @standupmaths Nice to meet you!
@dallascampbell @jonculshaw Excellent! Might trigger some star formation.
@erikapal @alexjsolar @slyardley I couldn't possibly say :)
@drclairemurray @suziesheehy @standupmaths @DiamondLightSou So many great things to see and do!
@samurai1963 @Tim_O_Brien See you soon!
@markmccaughrean @MagnusWoods @IamComet67P Bit of crushed charcoal?
@markmccaughrean @MagnusWoods @IamComet67P It's a bit pale!
@chriscwharris You never know!
After an amazing morning it's time to get back to research using @NASASunEarth spacecraft to study the Sun's eruptions.
@markmccaughrean @honorharger Perhaps. But it encapsulates just how much it takes to make these missions happen.
@PenguinGalaxy @laurie_winkless @markmiodownik @JennyRohn @emilyadawson @apontzen Hello!
@helen_hm11 @asubsetofdaves @MihoJnvr @UKSolarPhysics It was great - very interesting!
@helen_hm11 @asubsetofdaves @MihoJnvr @UKSolarPhysics Sorry not to be there!
@susan_snowy It's very sad. It has gone horribly wrong.
@Rcotweet @spacelinklf @BroadwaterNews @astro_timpeake It was great to take part. Well done on organising another inspiring event!
@MihoJnvr Not sure… will let you know if I find out!
Photos from Friday's #TEDxlondon at the @sciencemuseum  https://t.co/lhXxt1DnrO
@chriscwharris @astro_timpeake What a beautiful cat!
@DawnSunrise1 @Leon_Helmink They are! I was late to realise this.
@Leon_Helmink @astrotweeps @EssBarraclough We always have am emergency supply :)
Now learning about superhydrophobic surfaces… good unless surface is contaminated with oil. @uclmaps research is developing a way to help!
Learning about organic semiconductor research &amp; solar cells at the @uclmaps PhD festival. Indigo dye used as it's a great absorber of light.
@MihoJnvr You got out just in time! Flooding delayed the next train 💧
Prepping for the Sky at Night session on Planet 9 at #cheltscifest. @FitzsimmonsAlan is on brand! https://t.co/cXrZJ1aNpl
@jckcrll @asubsetofdaves @MihoJnvr @JamieBGall @mattjaywhy I'll courier over the documentation :)
@asubsetofdaves Hello Dave! From your fan club :) @MihoJnvr @JamieBGall @mattjaywhy https://t.co/vfRn4euAFD
@susan_snowy Fair enough!!
@susan_snowy Sounds like a great way to spend the afternoon!
@einionyn @mggtTaylor Looks like some serious science is happening!
@MihoJnvr @cheltfestivals Thanks! And see you soon!
Great to meet astronaut Anna Fisher at the @worldscifest in New York. I think I look pretty pleased to see her! https://t.co/irKQ9Qb8c1
@markmccaughrean @RonBaalke I need to look up details  but when plasma density &amp; speed high at earth -&gt; high pressure on mag. &amp; high impact!
@farrant_john @RonBaalke There's an MPEG format video here: https://t.co/yIElimW8Ep
@farrant_john @RonBaalke Was around 200 000 km high at time of photo and in the process of leaving the Sun.
@markmccaughrean @SpaceAmbassador Probably :)
@markmccaughrean Last time I was hear it was being used to soak up all the rain 💧
@scottkeir @asubsetofdaves When it comes to finding a link between a random object and the Sun  I have many ideas :) Enjoy the run &amp; 🍦
@diversionary @standupmaths If I chip in three more  you'll have enough for a calendar.
@asubsetofdaves I'll go for right-handed. But hard to say without intertwined emitting and absorbing threads 😀
I think @einionyn will appreciate this photo… https://t.co/pLETejhzYx
@AstroEmz @LeidenMarathon Amazing time! Congrats!
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks!
@PeoplesAstro @mssl_solar Thanks!
@JWCChristiansen @helen_hm11 @mssl_solar Thanks!
@helen_hm11 @mssl_solar Thanks!
@RogerHighfield @mssl_solar Thanks! Another trip around the Sun completed :)
@ukhoosier @standupmaths There are still a few more bits around :)
@ruth_dale @standupmaths Thanks!
@seb_ly @standupmaths He does! Took me by surprise!
@PenguinGalaxy Thanks :) It was really fun to write!
@DavidBrockley One of today's speakers mentioned that the 1959 Soviet film the Sky Calls lands a rocket this way!
@Capoglou No website sadly  but there will be a report. Focus is how to set policy that allows breakthrough innovation in space.
@EmiliaKilpua check out our new telescope operator! @erikapal is chasing the clouds away for the Mercury transit. https://t.co/wZoGHMtbWJ
@sjb_astro @EpicCosmos @BBCStargazing @AstronomyNow You have clear skies! I am jealous :)
@whitenigel @Ri_Science Thanks for coming. And for winning the spot @standupmaths game :)
@e_astronomer Martin really should be on Twitter! It was a real treat to chat with him today.
@Roy_Astro @BBCRadio4 Thanks :) I don't delve much into aurora. But @m_windridge has a new book out on exactly that topic :)
@mrsdenyer That looks very familiar! It's a beautiful place :)
@MihoJnvr @MSSLSpaceLab :) see you tomorrow!
@jckcrll @asubsetofdaves @long_daithi @qsl_deb @slyardley I think that was me behind the lens. What a lovely evening it was!
@rjmlaird @idisruptspace you need to add two more for Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus :)
@mggtTaylor @ISSIBern I think we have opened a new comedy genre :)
@mggtTaylor @ISSIBern Stringy cheese to represent magnetic field lines... #EmmentalHD
@SamStreetr @standupmaths Thanks :) I hope you enjoy it!
@TomTomBigBum @sciencefocus Thanks for letting me know :)
@sciencefocus Thanks!
@helen_hm11 @space2earth Thanks Helen! It was a joy to put the stories together - old and new! But so many that I didn't have room to tell.
@stecks @sciencemuseum Thanks :) See you soon!
@TheRealMike @sciencemuseum Thanks and hope you enjoy the book!
@long_daithi @sciencemuseum Well  thank you for the awesome movies!
@dr_jpeastwood @sciencemuseum Thanks for coming! Hope to see you to catch up properly soon.
Thanks to everyone who came to the @sciencemuseum Lates to hear about the Sun and #15milliondegrees. It was lovely to chat with you!
@jen_gupta @AEOUD I'll be missing NAM again sadly. Have another meeting already booked in :(
It seems that no one does acronyms like astronomers do! Great stories by @jen_gupta at @AEOUD who recommends https://t.co/M2mP3KmkQs
@DawnSunrise1 @harryvcliff @sciencemuseum Thanks :)
@helen_hm11 @m_windridge @harryvcliff @sciencemuseum Thanks! Have a lovely week.
@m_windridge @harryvcliff @sciencemuseum Thanks!
@helen_hm11 @space2earth I'm not sure when the images were taken exactly. But there has been some southward directed magnetic field in SW.
@DawnSunrise1 @sciencemuseum Maybe see you there?
Come join us at @sciencemuseum Lates next wk. I'll be talking abt the Sun &amp; launching my new book #15MillionDegrees https://t.co/M5lgiDj4I9
@einionyn Good luck &amp; have fun!
@Peter_dk79 @standupmaths Not me this time! :)
@AstroAndyN @standupmaths thanks :)
@gailsci The archives are fabulous and fascinating! Hopefully see you soon.
@ntfc2 @standupmaths I will!
@ntfc2 @standupmaths Ah  thanks &amp; early happy birthday!
@diversionary @standupmaths Thanks!
For the record: @standupmaths is legally obliged to be hugely biased.  https://t.co/MN5401or6M
@StellarPlanet @CatherineQ I am in the UK. Each eclipse is so exciting - wish I was able to see this one. Roll on August 21 2017!
@chrisenorth ☀️😀
@chrisenorth @FitzsimmonsAlan Flares don't have any impact on creation of aurora - it's the solar wind and CMEs that are important :)
@chrisenorth Looks a fast solar wind steam did the trick!
@markmccaughrean Wow  have a great trip!
@markmccaughrean Tonight would be a good night to be on a flight!
@Katie_H_Joy @lewis_dartnell @Doctor_Astro I have never been so unexpectedly organised :)
@SkylarkBill @RogerHighfield There is a recent paper by Bernhard Kliem on it. Not sure if it is open access though.
If humans had the same composition as the Sun  what would we be made of? Great blog post by @asubsetofdaves https://t.co/5XoZeGBF7k
@Roy_Astro @DrJoVian @esa I'm not sure who runs that account. Will probably get more active as we approach launch (2018).
@asubsetofdaves @EssBarraclough @standupmaths Brilliant!
@khrizmo @standupmaths :)
@PeterMadelaine @mggtTaylor @GuildfordAS Hello!
Wait  who is that in the background? Did @standupmaths photobomb us?! :) https://t.co/qoMKCGPSt1
@markmccaughrean @mggtTaylor  :)
@DarrenBaskill @mggtTaylor I don't know how he does it!
@asubsetofdaves and thanks to you too. We support each other :)
@PaulPoakley @DrStuClark Thanks for letting us know. See you next year!
@daverothery @NASANewHorizons I am tempted :)
@AstroMelly @DrStuClark @DrBrianMay Thanks for coming! See you next year :)
@CtrlQ @AstronomyNow @stevenyoungsfn @DrStuClark nice to see you!
@8lakeyuk @DrStuClark Thanks and see you next year!
@markmccaughrean @AstronomyNow @esascience enjoy the rugby :)
@GrahamBowes @popastro @mandybailey2 She's very persuasive :)
@8lakeyuk @NorthEssexAstro @DrStuClark @davecosmos @mrhannaninspace Helloo!
ESA's Gaia spacecraft has made 326 billion astrometric measurements since its launch in 2012 - @markmccaughrean at Astrofest2016
@space_tom You are excused :) Have fun!
@jckcrll @mggtTaylor Helloo!
@mathewjowens @jckcrll @mggtTaylor Love it!
As is customary @mggtTaylor started his Astrofest talk with a selfie. So I took a selfie selfie. https://t.co/ls5egbhzkC
So pleased to have @mggtTaylor giving us a Rosetta update now!
@DawnSunrise1 See you later!
@FitzsimmonsAlan Ah  yes! A classic and a favourite of mine :)
@helen_hm11 Thanks! The views here are spectacular.
@mggtTaylor @ESA_Rosetta @markmccaughrean @standupmaths @DrStuClark Very much looking forward it!
@AlfrescoDB @BBCStargazing @jen_gupta Wonderful!
@MrLyford @BBCStargazing Ok :)
@MrLyford Thanks! Love the Chladni plate images.
Where would we be without smartphones? I'm on train after @BBCStargazing &amp; still able to follow @astro_timpeake as he preps for space walk.
@Smantha101 @BBCStargazing Not that we know of. Key thing would be if its mass significantly changed. But that doesn't look likely!
@geeves1987 @BBCStargazing Glad you like it!
@frankzrx @rjmlaird Somewhere that wasn't warm enough :) Actually  it was lovely when we did get a break in the clouds!
@themoonweaver @BBCStargazing Not sure why it says that… I'll have a look.
@helen_hm11 We had all the weather!
@sjb_astro @BBCStargazing Weather looks better tomorrow but sadly we won't be stargazing. It's all about Tim tomorrow!
Hope you enjoyed @BBCStargazing tonight! Follow this link if you'd like to find my Whispering Stars message: https://t.co/ohDQQqsFqr
@KmunityOfEquals @BBCStargazing We need radio eyes :)
@Hannahbellaaaa @BBCStargazing :)
@mggtTaylor @BBCStargazing @MetMattTaylor Mmm… best get the brolly out then!
@rjmlaird @UKSEDS Hopefully see you another time!
@moveitma @BBCStargazing Elly was great - so knowledgable and a role model for young women.
@SuperstarHelen @BBCStargazing Hope you got a good view!
@brianashton @BBCStargazing I know! Sorry! :)
Big thanks to Macclesfield Astro Society for braving the British weather for @BBCStargazing tonight!
@astrofairy @RoyalAstroSoc @apontzen Congrats Andrew!
@m_windridge I am looking forward to it!
@rjmlaird Hello!
Interesting meeting at the @RoyalAstroSoc today to discuss the tools of our trade: current and future ground &amp; space-based telescopes.
@Rcotweet @spacelinklf I'll be there tomorrow! Will you still be around?
@StellarPlanet :) hope all is well with you!
Preparation for next week's @BBCStargazing was fun today. Especially when they had me saying "perigee syzygy" in the voice overs.
@chrisenorth Congratulations!
@mattwmusic @standupmaths And to you too!
@helen_hm11 Let's do that! Happy New Year to you too!
@hesketx @DawnSunrise1 @Kevin_Fong Great to hear :)
@gailsci Thanks! It was an honour to take part and great to chat with you afterwards.
@moveitma @PeoplesAstro @willgater @Tim_O_Brien @Avertedvision Beautiful image!
@helen_hm11 Thanks :)
@helen_hm11 @Ri_Science @Kevin_Fong Sorry I missed you!
@KarenLMasters @BBCStargazing Thanks :) And great to see the Lottie Doll on the ISS! I plan to change the Twitter handle soon :)
@jen_gupta @ProfBeckyParker @astronomyblog @sciencemuseum Will try!
The countdown clock is ticking and the Union flags are flying in the @sciencemuseum https://t.co/AnN6gVCMic
2500 school children will be in the @sciencemuseum watching Tim Peake launch. The atmosphere is amazing!
En route to the @sciencemuseum for Tim Peake's launch at 11:03 GMT. Hope you get to see it  wherever you are!
@helen_hm11 At the Science Museum. See you there?
@dallascampbell @BBCPallab @BBCStargazing Wow! Enjoy the launch. Amazing to get such a close-up view beforehand.
@MihoJnvr Yes! Let's try and get @gregfoot &amp; @standupmaths too :) Meet you out the front.
@MihoJnvr I am! Are you here?
@Tim_O_Brien @BBCStargazing Just out the back of @AtBristol.  Great location!
Gorgeous! RT @susan_snowy: @Dr_Lucie @BBCStargazing I took this tonight  between clouds! https://t.co/Y8cMMxYW9Y
Lovely live views of the Orion Nebula tonight. Getting ready for @BBCStargazing https://t.co/9IfZuuTRqV
@JamieBGall @FOTSN @asubsetofdaves Very much so!
@GrahamBowes :)

Lovely way to end the week - recording a podcast with @Spaceboffins and chatting about our wonderful poet-in-residence @EssBarraclough
@walkerpjames @asubsetofdaves I agree!
But to get this information from sunlight we need to create a spectrum and study the spectral lines @asubsetofdaves
So much information can be obtained from sunlight - plasma density  flows  temperature and  my favourite  magnetic field. @asubsetofdaves
Second day at the STFC summer school for PhD students. @asubsetofdaves is giving us a great talk about spectroscopy.
@NWAstroFest @KnowledgeObsAst @chrisenorth I am away that weekend :(
@KnowledgeObsAst @chrisenorth @NWAstroFest Depends on the date… when is it?
@EssBarraclough @slyardley @asubsetofdaves Today was fab! I have been re-reading the poems this evening.
@helen_hm11 Congrats! :)
@RogerHighfield @UCL_Academy We found that students often came in early anyway! We are always open to using research to inform practice.
@RogerHighfield We did this at the @UCL_Academy - for the upper year groups :)

@Nickuae @sciencemuseum it was fab - thanks so much for setting all this up!
Wonderful to be met by this view in the @sciencemuseum stores today  but they are not the telescopes I am after… http://t.co/4aXsf7XDUM
Off to the @sciencemuseum this morning to find the early space telescopes built by my colleagues at #UCL - first rocket launch was in '57.
@GrahamBowes Nice shot!
@MCockerham A few - I started to publish in other journals as well as Solar Physics :)
@MCockerham I had my first publication in that journal in 2001 :)
@GrahamBowes I am :) Wonderful views of the aurora!
@Victrix75 Thanks!
Arrived at the @sciencemuseum for an all-female line-up to discuss life as a solar physicist - part of an ebook launch.
@dallascampbell @KarenLMasters @jodrellbank Solar eruptions I can do  aurora in the UK is harder :)
@dallascampbell @KarenLMasters @jodrellbank Unlikely that we will get aurora in the UK tonight. The solar eruption has passed over us now.
@lewis_dartnell @grb090423 I give facts for free :)
@grb090423 @lewis_dartnell That would be news to @standupmaths ! :)

@ProfMike_M @Paul_Crowther &amp; that is why we spend 2% of GDP on R&amp;D - it's useful - if less useful - less $£€ - even if motivated by interest

@Cosmic_Horizons @brendonbrewer states unequivocally presumes &gt;50s have nothing to offer. Doesn't fix Ph.D. Researcher balance (19:1 prob)
@Cosmic_Horizons @sarahkendrew @drarnakarick everyone would then be long term post docs -great if people will do it under current conditions
@Cosmic_Horizons @sarahkendrew @drarnakarick no - academia is only one way forward for PhDs - success does not equal academia!
@drarnakarick @Cosmic_Horizons this means clear 3yr+ post docs as a rule  and clear signal and support for EMCRs with long-term future
@drarnakarick @Cosmic_Horizons it's an international issue  my goal is to try to avoid worst bits by lobbying funding agencies &amp; own actions

@weezmgk otherwise  a reflection of the sun off something  near you might give a rainbow offset from normal positions.
@weezmgk I suspect that R2 is the brightest (and is 42deg)  R1 is much fainter and is 52 deg  and R3 is the 'glory' &amp; centreed around shadow
@weezmgk so 1 straight ahead (sounds like glory)  the 45 above and 45 below are the same rainbow ( just the top &amp; the bottom of the circle)
@weezmgk angles do not depend on proximity of clouds-you can draw a picture with pen  &amp; use your phone or computer to take a photo and post!
@weezmgk I don't understand the geometry based on description-rainbow is at 42deg opp sun   2nd ~52deg  where is your 3rd rainbow?
@weezmgk Other effect is known as a 'Glory' that you see directly opposite the rainbow - or from airplanes http://t.co/2ci4Knhswt
@weezmgk so top and bottom bow are probably same bow. Rainbows are circles if you - see image http://t.co/td7FVIyEkS
@weezmgk Perhaps draw me a diagram  and post it - Something unusual is required  because it cannot be formed like a normal rainbow
@weezmgk @DoctorKarl @PantheraUncia76 unsure - was 3rd bow concentric with other 2  was it inside our outside two bright ones?
@apfergus @AstroKatie @peterdedmonds You got my reference! I was born in 1967! so this is my birth year.

@GhostOfPJK @realscientists Agreed - concentration will depend on source of coal - general overview @sciam http://t.co/4QfPv1iUHg
@realscientists @GhostOfPJK The coal burning doesn't change radioactivity  so whatever is released is what was in coal to begin with

With an intro like Tron... @MeteoriteMinute is a whole ton of #STEM in a short space of time - https://t.co/p8dVyMzq5e from @geoffnotkin
@unknownsymmetry @Jane_MacArthur @msgmeteorites lovely
If you're a fan of @MeteoriteMen we have THREE only of the Imilac/VACA found ON THE SHOW... meteorite kits https://t.co/WruxaeQUJC DM 4 info
@WelshMagician @MeteoriteMinute @geoffnotkin Mars for me  Geoff?
@WelshMagician @MeteoriteMinute @geoffnotkin WOOOA!.... love love love.... Me would be Gene Cernan...@geoffnotkin ???
@markmccaughrean @RainerKresken @ScienceNelson @LFC If you had a Huygens or Giotto Mug I'd be up for that!
@RainerKresken @ScienceNelson @markmccaughrean @LFC Space geek mugs not footy ones at chez Howes https://t.co/f54BQhu0Bu
@Woodtoast @kreegan99 You will have such a blast!
@AuerSusan Well tested then! :-(
@NASAWatch @DailyMailUK Amazed they didn't say it was immigrants in charge of the laser...  the Faily Fail is the lowest of the low
@m_vandenbrouck very true.. downgraded my car to small as poss  recycle everything... you're so right
@m_vandenbrouck Ideally educating the far east to stop thinking that Ivory and powdered Rhino testicles (sic) are medicinal
@DavidGalvin9 @MeteoriteMinute another excellent question!
@DavidGalvin9 @MeteoriteMinute Cross matching to the Apollo lunar samples and the various isotope ratios/composition is how
@GabrielleNYC @WhitbyPhotos you're not kidding!
Proud to have become a member of the @BIS_spaceflight at the recent New Scientist Live show...
Awesome and frankly perfect line up of award nominees this year for the Clarke awards @BIS_spaceflight https://t.co/ntfw1r4tzH
@WelshMagician @MeteoriteMinute Hitting a Zombie with a 147g JuanCheng may not kill it  but they'd get a nasty bruise! @geoffnotkin ????
@WelshMagician @MeteoriteMinute Mine was Barwell UK  great day  but found zip... @geoffnotkin are we talking "return to Sweden...;-)"
@WelshMagician @MeteoriteMinute Great question... awesome in fact.. Mine was Oman in 2014  but @geoffnotkin ???
@markmccaughrean @Astro_Adept @Robotbeat One aspect differs though  Historically only Govt had technology/funding levels  but you're right
@rjmlaird @ESA_EDM If only such a comedic approach and attitude were pervasive after the Beagle 2 "failure"
@isapinza yes he can.. I will add you now as friend and Dm you
@comets77 I see some aphelion data there ;-)
Meteorite Men aired on a range of channels @Discovery @QuestTV etc for several seasons and was a huge hit... here's… https://t.co/oLTzTpuuBx
@Cosmic_Carol hoping he gets well soon
@Cosmic_Carol @Leaving_Orbit I guess the twitter handle convinced me
@Leaving_Orbit @Cosmic_Carol I apologise  I thought you were  and thank you for the correction (you're still outstanding in my eyes)
@Cosmic_Carol Jon Amos  Pallab  David (and Rebecca) are all at the top of their game. The appalling way dealt with  was not on
@Cosmic_Carol It was like "oh you're just a journalist  why are you asking me this?" Well I'm from the best news team on the planet and ...
@Leaving_Orbit @Cosmic_Carol Truly appalling "I don't understand the question" almost made me choke on my coffee.BBCsci are world class team
@Cosmic_Carol spot on... you took the words out of my mouth
@Cosmic_Carol Deal with the facts and be honest. No spin  no BS  no grey suit mentality... be clear  concise and go with your heart
@Cosmic_Carol JW's response to Pallab et al this morning  didn't go down well... it smacked of bad PR. Needed more of the FD's honesty
@Cosmic_Carol Yup  it needs a solid press release to come out from the FD...as soon as any analysis is in of course
@Cosmic_Carol The issue is also that the press conference was not great. I agree though  this headline is silly
@kennicosmith Be strong...and take great memories forward
@forthelaunch Fears for 2020 for sure
@forthelaunch @Victrix75 @esaoperations @ESA_EDM aye.. I know
@AwesomeAstroPod @AstroDSLR Biggest concern is for 2020 mission..
@AwesomeAstroPod @AstroDSLR I spoke to Colin not long after at a Mars event in Wroughton and he was broken by the sheer vitriol
@esaoperations @AwesomeAstroPod @NASAJPL next time  maybe they could send Adam Steltzner too?
@AwesomeAstroPod @AstroDSLR bingo!
@forthelaunch @Victrix75 @esaoperations always pays to wait ;-)
@AstroDSLR @BBCPallab @BBCAmos @SkyNews Sky News is run by Rupert Murdoch.. and have people like Kelvin on as commentators... enough said!
@Astro_Adept very true  been saying that all morning... it's just the superstition stats (Apollo 13  cosmosnauts urinating on sheels etc)
@Cosmic_Carol I hope someone asks this question at the PC though... it needs to be asked... as it's on everyone's minds
@Cosmic_Carol aye  I have one in brew too
@Cosmic_Carol It's non scientific so it bothers me  but ...yes  there is a lot of existing superstition in space industry
@Cosmic_Carol no  we can't   but superstition plays a part (cosmosnauts weeing  no 13's in any mission etc etc)
@Cosmic_Carol need ground truth mission now  and I'd be basically bricking it if I were launching my big rover on a Russian launcher..
@Cosmic_Carol I suspect the calm before the wake for lander :-(... TGO will be amazing though
@cosmos4u spent time with Colin at the science museum...so sad
@cosmos4u true..for the cost of a premiership football player ..only so much can be done
@mggtTaylor @timmermansr needs you in a Hawaiian
@timmermansr @cosmos4u isn't ..dang phone
@timmermansr @cosmos4u fat lady as it singing yet .. but .. yes
@cosmos4u @timmermansr too busy making fluffy toys ;)
@Samcornwell @mggtTaylor @janwoerner in orbit only at this time... fingers crossed!
@cosmos4u I know :-(
@pilliarscreatio @Cosmic_Carol ditto... this HAS to work for so many reasons
@Cosmic_Carol @pilliarscreation Exactly  we're all waiting in hope
@DawnSunrise1 you're obviously not watching the live stream... it's like watching a wake
@AstroExeter @hastroparr anysmal... like watching paint dry... thankfully the scientists are brilliant and the work brilliant
@hastroparr @AstroExeter expected LOS I hasten to add
@hastroparr @AstroExeter LOS still at the moment...
@hastroparr @AstroExeter I have a bunch of very bored looking people in a control room with "loss of signal from highgain" antenna latest
@hastroparr @AstroExeter https://t.co/SJ7O3uWJxu works... buzzing!... #irony
@hastroparr @AstroExeter nope... me either...
@AstroExeter @hastroparr please wait for broadcast to begin... erm?
@LauraForczyk no doubt physics is the same  just we have nothing on any scale that could even come close
@LauraForczyk Comet - 12 months.. nothing larger than a bus outside of LEO since 1972... we have 0% chance of saving anything right now
@ScienceChannel Moon would be a good start...
@Cosmic_Carol 40 minutes long  seriously one of the dullest things ever...
@Cosmic_Carol Having seen some of the other videos  it's par for the course. I remember in Ghenk everyone literally fell asleep to one !
@Cosmic_Carol @ESA_EDM gone for accuracy with no sound then! ;-)
@QuarkTees @spaceflashnews oh god no! not more of this crap
@LauraForczyk @TheMarsSociety Comets bigger problem...35km wide at 25 000mph...good luck redirecting anything with 12mth notice!
@AwesomeAstroPod Rosetta... just wow... FD team IMHO deserve some award akin to the Nobel Prize for pure brilliance
@AwesomeAstroPod @Philae2014 no  it was outstanding given it Tiggered its way across the comet
@markmccaughrean @BBCAmos Good luck on this one... very important!
@pilliarscreatio Cymru am byth my friend
@pilliarscreatio the news and a program about to air about the events of that tragic day..
@freestarcharts about 6.3
@Cosmic_Carol @thehighfrontier worked in the music industry don't forget... lots of visits to AES show
@Cosmic_Carol @thehighfrontier Not the only thing ridiculous in that neck of the woods... used to visit quite a lot
@Cosmic_Carol @thehighfrontier if you say it fast enough  the name of the airport sounds about right... #shithole
My article with @WordenAlfred in @spaceanswers magazine this month!.. it's HUGE!! https://t.co/JBP34rtMHq
@geoffnotkin John says hi come back soon https://t.co/X7Prv7coMD
@geoffnotkin will do
@TheSpaceGal @OneDublin nice!!!
@pilliarscreatio @hellospacething utterly brilliant
@hannahdev @jeff_foust they'd live  rough... but they'd live  that's what counts
@starlingLX Only O'Keefe should ever be blamed for anything bad on Hubble... no astronaut ever failed that scope.. he did!
@NASAWatch @blueorigin @virgingalactic simple ...follow both and hope both are a huge success/open up space travel for many more
@markmccaughrean That was in 2009  even my Irish friends warned me to "get dropped at the obsy doors...nowhere else"
@markmccaughrean Mine tried to drop me off on "that lane"... it was like a scene from "Escape from New York".. I refused to get out
@markmccaughrean https://t.co/gPAeEk04tQ  The observatory is lovely though... just don't mention the moon rock ;-)
@markmccaughrean https://t.co/w0075fIZFz even taxi drivers don't like to go near there!
@markmccaughrean take a flak jacket!
Looks like an outstanding event again for @WordenAlfred at Alton Towers with @Victrix75 for @WSW_UK
@thehighfrontier @Cosmic_Carol @pilliarscreatio @hastroparr That's small fry test...  reality is very different
@pilliarscreatio @Cosmic_Carol @hastroparr yup = 12-13 months ish
@hastroparr @Cosmic_Carol have a look at the online impact calculator... stick in 35km wide   made of rock/ice 45degree angle at 25 000mph
@pilliarscreatio @Cosmic_Carol @Spacefest They are sci fi... for larger bodies... okay with smaller at great distance  but ..
@Cosmic_Carol @hastroparr Done SOOO much on this topic. having found quite a few asteroids and helped confirm a LOT of comets
@Cosmic_Carol @hastroparr 35km wide moving at 80 000mph... hard as steel... nope   we're dead
@AstroExeter @Cosmic_Carol @hastroparr Very much. Hale Bopp was 1 month away from a potentially much closer brush! C2013A1 &amp; Mars !
@AstroExeter @hastroparr @Cosmic_Carol Comes from comets full stop.. new ones  you get 13 months notice.. Hale Bopp = 35km wide = screwed!
@Cosmic_Carol decades
@Cosmic_Carol only works at large distances and useless for comets
@Cosmic_Carol love to know how they plan to deflect em
@Markthemallet @hastroparr @ADavies915 no  it genuinely looks like someone is having a very poor taste laugh with that soft toy!
Annnd @BBCStargazing the most inappropriate gif images of a fluffy toy in history award goes to!
@Victrix75 you are  and my girls absolutely love you... thank you for everything...
The awesome @WordenAlfred is next appearing at Alton Towers to kick off UK's involvement in @WSW_UK . Event organised by #epic @Victrix75
Just on @LBC talking Rosetta with a huge H/T to FD team  science teams @mggtTaylor Rita Schulz and many more
@DrPioneer18 I know  I helped organise Spacefest in June and many said it was there last event
@ESA_History gracias amigo!
@BBCBreakfast @mggtTaylor Brilliant words... #STEM outreach motivation... nice one!
@MonicaGrady  Like a wake.... disturbingly so
@Ian_Benecken @twinklespinalot @esa @NASA yeah right!
@Astroguyz give it 6 months for the embargo to be lifted ... lol ;-)
@markmccaughrean @bbc5live as ever Mark  outstanding
@michealjroberts @vrooje @DrJoVian UG's have bigger issues with #Brexit et al right now and the opportunities for work/placements etc
@timmermansr @BillNye @IAC2016 @exploreplanets tell the Osiris team ;-)
@michealjroberts example with Al Worden this weekend  talking Apollo 15 to 300 kids for free in theatre in most deprived area of UK
@michealjroberts Ppl know my track record  and there are more like me who do this to engage as many ppl as poss in science
@michealjroberts Not at all  just wanting to know HOW people outside of the academic halls can help academics more with outreach
@michealjroberts @DrJoVian (2/2) is just one recent example. Working with academics on support material for the moon rocks
@michealjroberts @DrJoVian Money is one aspect  funding can be found for projects and self will drives a lot too. STFC Lunar project example
@DrJoVian @michealjroberts Interesting reading this and wanting to help academia do more/support more outreach
@NoniSturge @esa back up ... gracias  merci and danke
@Mistresspixel @CraftLass @Woodtoast @Reuters phew !! :-) happy days
@AstroExeter how many space agencies does it take to stream a conference ;-) #canorbitacomet #cantstreamapressconf
@Woodtoast @CraftLass @Mistresspixel @Reuters good to hear
@CraftLass @Woodtoast @Mistresspixel Tell me you're all okay? https://t.co/UsVHFu1cIF
@datachick @AstroKatie @guardian Sad but probably true Karen. I knew Rita  that's what made it touch home a lot more
@cldm_ish Much like a few others I know like @carolynporco #Bea Mueller and more.. great to know!
@DavidBflower sounds about right
@Blackprojects Jakub Cerny posted all the orbital data updates on multiple FB comet pages..
@RosettaMIDAS @markmccaughrean Great work!...
@DavidBflower @AstroExeter The wonderful thing about Tiggers.... ;-)
@pilliarscreatio know it well  great book  great story
Wasn't that just on display at @newscilive with smoke coming out of the top? ;-) https://t.co/x7pB1HlqsZ
@FakeAstropix I know  who knew that my home county is actually Hadley Rille
@pilliarscreatio https://t.co/PeHCBnUo2C
@pilliarscreatio It is a Federal offence to own or sell any Apollo moon rocks. The only exceptions are the Govt gifted ones (goodwill)
@FakeAstropix I'm on a mission on meteorites at the mo... ;-) https://t.co/Qjes5SIKZK
@FakeAstropix 10 mins in Photoshop and someone with the IQ of a sloth could knock that up.. sad isn't it?
@DrPioneer18 Yes  I know it well  it was taken the day I was born..
@martyschaer @markmcan @JeffBezos https://t.co/juueLJ2hRD good overview if you want the quick version
@martyschaer @markmcan @JeffBezos It blew up on all of them!
Funniest description ever of Comet 67P at @newscilive from the Pulsar stand... it's unprintable  but so amusing and accurate
@Astro_Adept @newscilive @MeteoritesAZ @BIS_spaceflight joy to meet you
@Victrix75 @BIS_spaceflight @Dr_Lucie @standupmaths @WordenAlfred @newscilive fab
Staggeringly successful @newscilive event for @MeteoritesAZ Europe ..and huge thanks to #spacecollective &amp; @BIS_spaceflight for everything
Only a very limited no.of Seymchan pallasite left on our stand at @newscilive .. and ONE moon rock #NSLive
Thank you all who made our first day @newscilive so amazing for @MeteoritesAZ ... Sunday will be fab too..
We have a limited number of the stunning #seymchan pallasite on our stand @newscilive https://t.co/mQBlPLOBg7
Delighted to say we now take all major card payments and contactless at @MeteoritesAZ  Europe .. see us at @newscilive this weekend
We have museum grade meteorites on our stand at @newscilive ..come and say hi this weekend
Drop by our stand next to S4 entrance for fantastic meteorites @newscilive https://t.co/bPK54O1OgI
Sat in the hotel with the El Tiro meteorite .. going to be the star piece tomorrow with piece of the moon @newscilive on our stand nr @esa
@SpaceMascotUK @contactlight69 @WordenAlfred @daraobriain @Victrix75 great pic
@goonhillyorg @spacegovuk @AmsatUK @Melcd @cornishengineer @invest_cornwall applied last year .. never again
@Blackprojects @Spacefest I spent time with Peter  his son at SF.. Never met Pete C himself though  he sadly passed a bit before my "time"
@Blackprojects @Spacefest A bit  apart from this one landed with Pete Conrad on the Moon in Nov 1969
@Blackprojects @Spacefest Had no monetary value to me  just wonderment at wearing something which w/on Moon  the day I was born!
@Astro_Adept yes and yes
@Victrix75 @WordenAlfred @BIS_spaceflight the free tickets we were offering... but it's all in hand..
@Astro_Adept @4tuneQkie @MeteoritesAZ we will have from new batch
@Victrix75 @WordenAlfred @BIS_spaceflight free tickets
@Victrix75 @WordenAlfred @BIS_spaceflight sadly too late to ship em now :-(
@PenguinGalaxy crying laughing at some of them... utter utter moron..
@markmccaughrean way too many syllables for most of his voters ...
@JayneMcCubbinTV @kielder_obs @BBCBreakfast Supplied by me to @kielder_obs
@sjb_astro @AwesomeAstroPod enjoy tonight ;-)
Heads up to all #meteorite fans. @MeteoritesAZ Europe will be at @newscilive with some amazing bargains on space rocks. See you there
@David_Scanlan @meteorbill @MeteoriteMen @SOTTnet wooiah
@AwesomeAstroPod Back up now  share the holy moly out of this link https://t.co/btJ8FZhQGF
@markmccaughrean @_Merlyn spot on!...
@DavidGalvin9 @AlDarkSkyWales cost of two large lattes and sandwiches at Starbucks
That's some endorsement  thank you @AwesomeAstroPod https://t.co/Upb5Hm0Ib9
@DavidGalvin9 sending out tickets Monday :)
@DavidGalvin9 looking after my friends makes me so happy
@DavidGalvin9 :)
@Cosmic_Carol @MeteoritesAZ well one of them will have more than one astronaut  but one will be at both
@Cosmic_Carol @pilliarscreatio and England... more then one in England too!
@pilliarscreatio yes mate  an Apollo astronaut in Wales... Cymru am Byth
@Cosmic_Carol Just waiting on the booking form to go live  site admins working like mad..
@cosmos4u @NASA close enough for Jazz..
@scienceogram @DavidBflower Gotta love a Tory Govt  they really know how to destroy science
@Cosmic_Carol @Spacefest June  second week  and yes
@WelshMagician @geoffnotkin @MeteoriteMen Told you it was a beauty!
@WelshMagician @geoffnotkin @MeteoriteMen absolutely chuffed for you bruv
@Astroguyz @Philae2014 @Nancy_A @universetoday They first spotted it over a year ago
@Space_Lectures @airandspace @LastManOnMoon Amazing isn't it? Had the honour of holding Apollo samples these past few months
@pilliarscreatio 15-17 were J (sorry I went to bed)
@hellospacething @DavidGalvin9 @MeteoritesAZ @geoffnotkin Wow... just ...wow
@markmccaughrean @WelshMagician @geoffnotkin Be interested to see what this pans out as
@Samcornwell @apod today's pic
So it seems like @apod is now about as credible as a Kim Jong Un space mission..
@lauriecantillo @NewHorizons2015 @NASA more then one in that field
@markmccaughrean @guardian there's many things the govt could stop but don't ..ivory just one sickening example
@markmccaughrean @guardian about as hard as it is to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia?
@AstroExeter The girls love it  they've been having pool parties with their friends this week..
@AstroExeter awesome fun!! solar heater is next thing for sure
@geoffnotkin right back at ya #FF #Feveryday
@spaceanswers outstanding book
This came from @hastroparr it's just pure genius https://t.co/qiPWqjx6xj
@NatureNews good tweet  unlike your other ones relating to this story which are shoddy clickbait for what is a good video
@markmccaughrean @AstroKatie @AllPlanets @exploreplanets First decent reporting I have seen on this whole story
@Exotides @cosmos4u @DavidBflower @Leaving_Orbit @ESO 30 000 miles a second  presents a bit of a challenge for that ;-)
@cosmos4u @DavidBflower @Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @ESO big leap from 45 000 mph to 30 000 miles a second ;-)
@RainerKresken @Leaving_Orbit at 30 000 miles per second.. that'll make Juno's recent endeavours look like a Trabant with a dodgy engine
@Leaving_Orbit @RainerKresken our lander about the size proposed by Hawking et al.. so ..very tricky
@Leaving_Orbit @RainerKresken oh no  working on a Mars methane lander with a team in Oz myself so we know the challenge just to orbit
@cosmos4u @ESO ha ha ha.... I'll get my Borg implant ready then
@cosmos4u @ESO I love the ironic wink Dan... speaks volumes ;-) And ... flyby at 30 000 miles/second.. yeah... good luck!
@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides "Holy Crap on a Cracker" has to be my favourite line so far...
@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit given we;ve ventured a grand total of 450 miles in the last 44 years from our planet  I'm not holding my breath
@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit But then you have supposed quality science press stating this! https://t.co/DfvSG0Diy3
@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @jaynebirkby This does seem to imply it's transiting hopeful angular res would allow more - https://t.co/XD4oNuhqDh
@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @jaynebirkby Also holding hope that SKA when fully online could be a powerful tool in this area of research
@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @jaynebirkby If I am wrong  then thanks for pointing that out
@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @jaynebirkby surely angular resolution good enough.. and spectra could be obtained on JWST?
@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit Some examples   from the good old British gutter press https://t.co/C6f6iA8AOs
@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @jaynebirkby JWST would be the other option.  I have a vested interest in that
@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit Seriously  outstanding work on your part (and any of your team). Shoddy journalism is major issue again here
@Leaving_Orbit @RainerKresken @Exotides Nice... one maybe for the 2m scopes at Siding to follow up on
@RainerKresken @Leaving_Orbit @Exotides That's one thread I have read. I'd like to know if that's the true case
@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides "Earth like  possibly with life..." and that's just reputable media... I dread to think what FOX/CNN are spouting
@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides I am in no way dismissing the outstanding work done here  I am dismissing the flagrant BS in the media though
@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides and it's non transiting  so a tad tricky to get much more right now it seems
@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides My FB post two hours ago was... ;-) Twitter has limits
@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides bigger problem is "Then what"... 11600 years to get there.. w fastest flyby ever (100 w Hawking plan)
@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides I read her work  it's very good..but we don't even know if it has an atmosphere yet
@WelshMagician @geoffnotkin @MeteoriteMen @MeteoritesAZ @MHUnlimited Thank you  it's been an awesome first year... many more to come
@Astro_Nicole I can't wait to promote this at @blueshiftirl with you... see you soon! https://t.co/LSTz55WSUI
This one for the @DailyMailUK @BBCRadio2 Jeremy Vine and that chap in Leeds - https://t.co/wHpNGDicmw #meteorites
At @BlueshiftIRL in October we'll have @NASA_Hubble #Apollo @NASAGoddard @ESA @LunarMissionOne @MeteoriteMen and #APOLLO astronaut/FC's
@geoffnotkin That is a stunner!
@genejm29 about 70 years time perhaps given our current rate of "exploration"
@BBCRadio2 I did t hear one expert on that show
@LogarthSheppy @DownHereOnEarth Indeed  superb 50 year + history in robotics  and absolutely sucked for 45 years at HSF
Next time @BBCRadio2 wants to have an expert on to talk about meteorites  try calling one! #BIMS #IMCA pick your people there
@DownHereOnEarth We've not been out of LEO since 1972... methinks I'm just fed up of hearing about plans...
And that whoever thought it was a meteorite is talking utter #buncum #leedsmeteorite @BBCRadio2
Discussion on the meteorite forums generally reaching consensus that the @BBCRadio2 item on the #leedsmeteorite was utter garbage
@StarkeyStardust @BBCRadio2 And slowly...but surely...they drew their plans against us... #dundunduurrr #wwaroftheworlds
@StarkeyStardust @BBCRadio2 seriously  was HC p**sed? Only explanation I can think of to explain the utter bilge coming from her
@StarkeyStardust @BBCRadio2 Send Heather Couper... ;-)
@StarkeyStardust @BBCRadio2 As a director of a meteorite company  how do you think I felt? !!!
Good to see @BBCRadio2 Jeremy Vine show broadcasting complete https://t.co/AXvZei2LUX about the Leeds #meteorite
@toomanypenguin @BBCRadio2 erm... on meteorites... https://t.co/AXvZei2LUX
@BBCRadio2 Erm.... complete and utter https://t.co/AXvZei2LUX
@KSCartist @Space_Lectures @astro_timpeake proud to have one of these Tim  thank you yet again for your outstanding work
Delighted that some of my #apollo collection is now on display at the @spacecentre https://t.co/P11hMWo81z
@cbellh47 @comets77 We took quite a few images early on in 67P campaign  then it all went a bit ... well..
@cbellh47 @comets77 Nor did ESA I suspect!
@cbellh47 @comets77 I did  very ...erm.... yes!
@timmermansr Tiles and flags flown on it  very emotional...
@hastroparr 41 years of making sunny delight in LEO since ASTP/Skylab era... yay... we rock! (sic)
@Endo_Chank @TakeThatDarwin @mbsevans seriously  you're a moron
Many thanks @DLR_en for your support during the Rosetta campaign. https://t.co/7HXnbCQ9hj
@mggtTaylor @markmccaughrean @redplanet00 Strangely also asked to upload all my data to JPL servers today  doing that now
@mggtTaylor @markmccaughrean @redplanet00 we did indeed  happy days!
@mggtTaylor @markmccaughrean @redplanet00 I don't consider myself to be part of the Rosetta sci team. Did attend early meetings though
@markmccaughrean @mggtTaylor @redplanet00 I think this was something done by the PACA people. I know I had a rqst for image/data
@markmccaughrean @mggtTaylor @redplanet00 Our team did a lot of early observations on 67P at Aphelion through to about 3 months b4 encounter
@markmccaughrean @mggtTaylor @redplanet00 I did work on some early Rosetta comms when contracted by EJR for you  but formal member ..no
@markmccaughrean @mggtTaylor @redplanet00 Just seeing this thread. What is the issue exactly? The DLR wall I was asked to submit to ages ago
Indeed @DavidBflower Methinks at this rate @apod could almost become a spin off of @FakeAstropix
So yet another faked up image on @apod today . That Mars rotation is not possible and is using HST data at best to "augment" #credibility0
@pilliarscreatio @hastroparr I like Glynn
@Blackprojects @unknownsymmetry @BestGalaxyPics We had several  and the J2 will get us out of LEO... it did in 1968-72
@unknownsymmetry @BestGalaxyPics It is when you've only been 450 miles in 45 years
@hastroparr Seen the other posts?
@BestGalaxyPics @unknownsymmetry only 238 000 miles more to go hey!
@therealdjflux Olympic sized swimming pool on steroids ;-)
@RonBaalke the large hole in the skull kind of worrying though
@markmccaughrean @DawnSunrise1 Only from 1974 to 1986 allegedly! ;-)
@DavidBrockley @markmccaughrean My two girls being that generation... ergo furious!
@markmccaughrean @DawnSunrise1 Wonkspeak is also spoken by people otherwise known as wonkspanners.. change vowels as you deem necessary
@markmccaughrean I think every scientist I know feels #Brexit was a catastrophe for UK science (H2020 etc). And students/Erasmus ..it's bad!
@ScienceNelson Let's hope come November the American people are able to see this too
@markmccaughrean Shambolic... :-(
@Rainmaker1973 doesn't show it bouncing back off and getting lost
@cosmos4u @NibleyFestival @BBCWiltshire They have a kids section which does do that  we were not doing anything "silly" at our stand!
@cosmos4u @NibleyFestival @BBCWiltshire lesson from that  don't believe what you read hey!
@cosmos4u @NibleyFestival @BBCWiltshire really...wow... silly science... H-Alpha observations  explaining the Sun.. spectroscopy... wow
@IgnazioMagnani @Space_Station @sukhpabial @helenczerski be still my dancing feet
@ruthie147 ha... you'd love to know!
@destin_space @tele_education Well they can reach for low Earth orbit as that's all we've done since 1972
@smashtie @AustinOnSocial @DJSnM kind of ... but none are a real threatat this time
@geoffnotkin @Lachtoday This means nothing to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :-)
@astroengine @Pillownaut brilliant... love Heather's comment!
@FakeAstropix @BlueshiftIRL Many thanks for your solid (as always) support.. Yes  Blueshift I think from info   didn't do it for bad reasons
@NorfolkStarwatc @Astroguyz Chichester is nice and not too far
@SpaceflightIns Apollo 15 all over again!
@Louiestowell Just have a look at some of the comments made by senior NASA figures about Eileen Collins' speech
@NASA_go4launch @NASA Can we just call it what it is... the greatest technical achievement in human history full stop  all of #Apollo
@ScienceNelson outstanding
Nice work @ScienceNelson with #mercury13 article. Have you read "Promised the Moon?" awesome book
@pilliarscreatio @BlueshiftIRL Hubble bubble... ;-)
@pilliarscreatio @BlueshiftIRL Got a new guest just checking with NASA today that it's okay for him to come over... someone you met at SF7
@AusAndgie7 It's taken 3 at least to get us back oto ability to leave LEO  so yup  I'd agree with that
@pilliarscreatio @BlueshiftIRL Did you get the Earlybird discount?
@pilliarscreatio @BlueshiftIRL aye...  ;-)
@pilliarscreatio @BlueshiftIRL The line up.... oh boy!!
@markmccaughrean just so sad that people react in this way
@DavidGalvin9 @badas_tweets @NWAstroFest @BigUpSpaceJane @larlar1971 @ADavies915 Jane = epic!
Early October will see one of the greatest STEM outreach events in Europe  with astronauts from Apollo/ISS and more + me and @geoffnotkin
@Jane_MacArthur @Cindydelight @LaunchFever2 @Cygnusx112 just up the road from me!
@Astro_Adept yup
@Louiestowell me too!
@Louiestowell PMSL brilliant!
@Louiestowell The People's front of Judea.... or the People's Judean front?
@Louiestowell and Voyager grand tour  New Horizons arrival at Jupiter  Viking landing on Mars in 1976 using 1960s tech... apart from that
@Louiestowell Oribital insertion of the "bus sized" Cassini spacecraft through the ring plane  then deploying the deepest lander ever..
@Louiestowell "juno was the hardest thing NASA has ever done"... yeah  right  ranks right up there with Apollo..
@crocodilekatie @NASA Skycrane/MSL  Viking  Voyager  Whole Apollo program... shall we continue?
@crocodilekatie @NASA Exactly! Methinketh Mr Bolton will be regretting that excited statement for some time
Not long to go now until @CampMeteorite in the UK... if you have not booked yet  get in fast!! - https://t.co/ghQkR6SFlQ with @geoffnotkin
@MatanJeda @3DCreative3D @stillgray @NWAstroFest That was the retrofire console connector to the Univac
@hastroparr like nothing I have ever seen  in ONE HOUR!!... just wow! Thank you so much for all your help on the stand!
Huge thank you to @NWAstroFest @spacecentre @Jane_MacArthur @hastroparr and all great friends. This weekend a huge @MeteoritesAZ success!
@ScienceChannel tracking yes... defending  only in theory
@skyatnightmag @AsteroidDay Fund research   don't cancel the Southern Hem sky survey (McNaught etc).. and build something that can help!
@spaceanswers How will we "avoid" one... please tell me ;-)
This is always great fun to roll out on @AsteroidDay https://t.co/KvQKZNTeg1 See just how "wiped out" your location will be!
From next week  a major part of the Saturn V launch control system will be on loan to the @spacecentre . So happy to have made this possible
@hastroparr @elarastar @Johnimus_Prime Seeing him in a few weeks  then on tour with him in a few months (Al..not Simon)
Delivering my #apollo hardware to the @spacecentre this week for a year long loan/exhibition feature
One for the awesome @Jane_MacArthur https://t.co/bwcV7307tO
@Jane_MacArthur @nicolablackwood With huge cuts to funding streams for so many (FP7  H2020 etc)  that's one huge threat to science
@RogerHighfield @HouseofCommons Understatement of the century. Science "Minister" living proof of that
@DrJoVian @Jane_MacArthur Awesome!
@Patrickm55P No  reality of what's going to happen to science funding  it's that simple
@SpaceKate @rocketman528 @DrLucyRogers @genejm29 correct .. But FP7 .. Horizon2020 etc are doomed
@WelshMagician @geoffnotkin @MeteoritesAZ @MeteoriteMen @NickAstronomer hopefully sorted soon
@unknownsymmetry @NickAstronomer @AstroExeter BBC news this afternoon
Airbus quote reported by BBC TV News earlier today. Thank you @AstroExeter for bringing it to my attn
@scorrice @jimalkhalili With an IQ about 130 points higher than any of the people making comments  one would hope so
That Airbus quote came from my great friend @AstroExeter
@Astro_Adept I think they want to support the UK  but it's sound economic logic from their point to look elsewhere now
@Astro_Adept https://t.co/Ugd2bhhmig
@Astro_Adept https://t.co/1dZZjDV6Nx
@R_Trotta @claranellist I'd like to know who the 1% are too..
@R_Trotta @claranellist Not one academic so far has with the FP7/H2020 funding decimation that's going to happen
@R_Trotta @claranellist He said "not a shot was fired..." the man is a moron of quite staggering proportions
@David_Scanlan @RoyalAstroSoc yeah  good luck on that one
@davidshukmanbbc @SPACEdotcom FP7/Horizon 2020 all shot to pieces  many academics in real fear now over lost funding
@claranellist FP7  Horizon 2020  Erasmus+... All EU... and yeah  good luck :-(
@SkyandTelescope good luck on that one!
@rjmlaird @RoyalAlbertHall @UKSEDS and about 170 academics so far have agreed with me
@rjmlaird @RoyalAlbertHall @UKSEDS Look at the reports  read what all the academics are saying
@WelshMagician @MeteoriteMen @MeteoritesAZ @geoffnotkin Exchange rate just collapsed.. but existing stock is okay
@cosmos4u yes  it is strange... people just denying the facts on science funding
@cosmos4u It's very sad my friend. I don't see people as fanatical. Just trying to make sure they realise the seriousness of the problem
@FitzsimmonsAlan precious little else
@taniaj78 @markmccaughrean Just think  by the time you hit the ground  you may even get a hi-res image release of it too ;-)
Want to share and experinece something like this? with @geoffnotkin  WELL YOU CAN #meteoritecampuk Aug 19-21 https://t.co/26wKw945UT
@DawnSunrise1 Site being updated by @MeteoritesAZ as we speak... email sales@aerolite.org for info at this time
Reminder that not only will you be hunting meteorites with @geoffnotkin during the day  but hunting asteroids at night #meteoritecampuk
Got o give a HUGE thank you also to @Jane_MacArthur for her amazing support on #meteoritecampuk PhD soon Dr MacArthur in meteoritics #epic
@Cosmic_Carol @MeteoritesAZ fantabulous!!!
#meteoritecampuk is being hosted by Emmy award winning TV host and world famous meteorite hunter @geoffnotkin from @MeteoriteMen
@BadAstronomer @FakeAstropix like APOD you mean? ;-)
@davemomo @BIS_spaceflight that's the beastie... mine doesn't look quite as neat though ;-)
@DawnSunrise1 @CampMeteorite news coming soon!
@iamscicomm Just go to or look at @spacefest and you'll see the impact art has on sci comm.. Al Bean  Mike Collins  Ron Wood  Nicole Stott..
@geoffnotkin @Spacefest I'll send some mobile shots but mark has the good ones
@elarastar @geoffnotkin my only hope is that the TSA do
@hellospacething @MeteoritesAZ @Jane_MacArthur it will be yours!
@Cosmic_Carol My pleasure!!
@markmccaughrean @RadioKate @FrankMillerInk A very real prospect though..
@Astro_Adept @DailyMailUK :-) true... maybe DM and the National Enquirer should team up?
@Astro_Adept The @DailyMailUK would not know a science story if it dropped like an asteroid on their heads... toilet roll of the worst form
@markmccaughrean @RadioKate That gallery may put Trump in power come November... nothing scares me more
@unknownsymmetry A great book!
@hastroparr @markstewartprod told ya! ;-)
@ShaneMcC @claranellist Trump can barely string a sentence together that contains fact.. I have no hope if he gets in
@ShaneMcC @claranellist I agree  support is not 100%  never will be... but would you rather spent 700 billion USD on killing people?
@Buzzs_xtina See you Friday... be nice to catch up (Spacefest you kindly put me in touch with Chris Lewicki)
@SullivansProjs @Spacefest @LastManOnMoon moh yes  well known for Apollo 10 fans
@Markthemallet @hastroparr I get there v late Saturday
The BIG REVEAL.... coming to @Spacefest a special preview of this amzing new film from the @LastManOnMoon team https://t.co/s5N1OoQGAQ
@crocodilekatie @elarastar you take care ...
@Cosmic_Carol can send before so you avoid import duty if that helps
@Cosmic_Carol @Spacefest by far one of the best of the biogs
@RocketmanJRS yo yo yo
@astro_carl @LibbyJackson__ @mars_stu I guess that 70% of press are just idiots then
@SP_JohnSullivan @NASAhistory @xandaolp @Spacefest huh? John it's only your politics I disagree with  I wish you'd stop saying stuff
@AstroScholarFdn @astro_DonThomas @ISS_CASIS and you and Kathy absolutely do that!
@AndrewRixLtd @DavidBflower £48 billion on HS2.... £75 million on Tim Peake...
@AndrewRixLtd @DavidBflower Helen Sharman was the first British astronaut  it all comes down to how you spin it...
@simcourtie @LibbyJackson__ @mars_stu @BBCWiltshire Mail  Express  Sun  Mirror and main BBC news channel maybe missed that memo ;-)
@simcourtie @LibbyJackson__ @mars_stu @BBCWiltshire awesome... and you guys have done a great job on that front
@LibbyJackson__ @mars_stu Journalists get their info from somwehere. If it was clarified from day one  maybe it would not have happened
@mars_stu @LibbyJackson__ It all comes from the source material...
@mars_stu very true Tim has been nothing but exemplary
@jen_gupta @govender @_EliGrant @coffee_samurai outreach should never compete  and absolutely not when it's for benefit for disabled kids
@jen_gupta @govender @_EliGrant @coffee_samurai very complimentary from what I can see as TS project is different focus
@jen_gupta @govender @_EliGrant @coffee_samurai very interesting in light of the  funded project for https://t.co/L2eklb0sts
@JPMajor and will be 70 years since we last did anything significant in human spaceflight... very depressing how we have regressed so badly
@genejm29 ah  sorry that's not what you mentioned  you said first succesful landing on Mars... sorry!
@genejm29 no  the Mars lander did transmit  ergo successful landing and sent data..
@genejm29 Russia was the first to successfully land on Mars for all of 30 seconds...  #facts
@RhEvans41 @NASAhistory Gordo didn't help himself with his "reluctance" to train in sims etc... but still...
@RhEvans41 @NASAhistory Deke and Al Shepard' close friendship
@RhEvans41 @NASAhistory a manual landing at that... the guy knew how to fly  but got "canned" (spammed) from Apollo because of bias
@RhEvans41 @NASAhistory Closest carrier landing pretty much ever... that's not a lightweight
@NASAhistory @RhEvans41 and then gets canned from Apollo for "not pulling his weight enough in training".. after a perfect Mercury mission
@RonBaalke @geoffnotkin @LibbyLegs Sadly clouded out on the scopes or I'd have had a blast at imaging it
@einionyn @Braun23Austin @apod good as that other gif is clearly fake
@PeoplesAstro @DrBrianMay @alifeofriley @DrAliceRoberts @daraobriain agreed
@pilliarscreatio am donating one of them to the @NAF_Ataxia auction at @Spacefest Hoping that all the astros will sign that one too
@pilliarscreatio @Spacefest @Cosmic_Carol I own the original 1968 schematics from whence that came https://t.co/jWaCOQg0DW
@AstroCourses @AfricaAstronomy Terrific  I'll spread the word (Don't know if you knew  I worked for the SKA project in UK for two years)
@AstroCourses @AfricaAstronomy URL?
@DavidBrockley Agreed  petition starter needs to fix that
@geoffnotkin @Spacefest epic
@hellospacething @MeteoriteMen The audio was not great  but it was a life changing event for me!
@unknownsymmetry was great
@hastroparr yup  money grabbing as ever
Want a WORLD FIRST look at the film shoot for the new movie previewing at @Spacefest from the @LastManOnMoon team? https://t.co/WOcQKkJGFB
@cosmos4u Kind of agree... given we've sucked so badly at HSF for 44 years  but it's a fine achievement
@Cosmic_Carol nice... can recommend Kitt Peak  Mt Lemmon  Barringer Crater  Mirror Lab at UOA  Biosphere 2..
@radjanirad a wookie cookie.... epic!!
@Cosmic_Carol The hotel aircon is amazing Carol  you'll be fine  and we only ever go outside in the evening for drinks  it is mentally hot
@hastroparr Indeed I have one!
@deicherstar @hastroparr @AstronomyMag @AlanStern But Alan is cool  so I'll let this one pass ;-)
@ibookery Much like the ones on the AGC and DSKY... ya know  the ones that got us to the Moon and back 9 times ;-)
@ibookery Sandy had the ICC-0081 and Sharp had the EL-8 at the same time as Cernan/Duke et al were driving lunar rovers though ;-)
@ibookery true  I was kind of working on clock cycles/cpu/memory ... ;-) and trying not to confuse the public too much
@ibookery sorry  I missed a few digits... 800 000 000 times ;-)
@ibookery That thing 800 000 times less powerful than the computers we're using the languish in Low Earth Orbit for 44 years with ;-)
@TonyToners @imascientist @claranellist @Jo_Do I agree with that sentiment 100%
@TonyToners @claranellist @Jo_Do Yes  they're called idiots I do believe...
To all friends in the U.S.A @LastManOnMoon is now out and available on DVD and Blu Ray to order....
@imascientist @claranellist @Jo_Do That's not what it says. or how it's being pitched with that strap line. that's my point
@markmccaughrean @sarahkendrew That's what we want to hear Mark... get that big scope to orbit!!
Huge thank you to the @LastManOnMoon team for their amazing donations to the @NAF_Ataxia auction at @Spacefest
@markmccaughrean @sarahkendrew Just make sure that the Ariane works.... that's pretty much what the world wants first!
@claranellist @Jo_Do @imascientist Perfect  happy to help. It's a topic I am very passionate about (that and comet hunting)
@claranellist @imascientist Point me at it..  I work with a slew of Apollo astronauts on a day by day basis
@claranellist @imascientist the process of sending is a better way of pitching it.. not "should we"... as that's nonsenical
@imascientist @claranellist It's akin to asking "should we just languish in LEO for 44 years  growing seeds &amp; converting pee in to Sunny D"
@imascientist @claranellist There is no debate here... literally no debate whatsoever
@pilliarscreatio @Spacefest @NAF_Ataxia if you want to give all the money to a great cause  then I am sure someone would
Wow @apod scammed again... M31 backdrop... yeah right!
@SpaceportNQY @david_hurn we can't even get out of LEO right now
@markmccaughrean @hastroparr @geoffnotkin @MeteoritesAZ @Jane_MacArthur @beccagladden if it's any consolation ..you're one of mine
@geoffnotkin @MeteoritesAZ @Jane_MacArthur @hastroparr @beccagladden thank you G
@Tsenzee Suspect a bit of both... would need to see research paper though
@TheAntmagic @Jane_MacArthur @hastroparr thank you so much
And in the days before sat nav  some useful directions for how to get there..  @LastManOnMoon https://t.co/1t70rO78od
I even have the laminated @LastManOnMoon pass to go with it... lol https://t.co/zuRO7dAKEN
So my party invite for @LastManOnMoon arrived a little late... need to find a suitable tie and jacket ;-) https://t.co/zRwPj7gM7j
The awesome @LastManOnMoon is now available IN THE UK on @iTunes !!!! awesome!!!
@geoffnotkin @Spacefest I'll DM you
@AstroExeter That's easy... rocket blower tastic time
@AstroExeter That's a fantastic first light John!
@Blackprojects I have a few things Gunter touched and signed mate
@hastroparr @gazsc @giffgaff @WhichUK looking at alternative providers  sick of the sneaky way Goff Gaff are behaving
@hastroparr @gazsc @giffgaff @WhichUK 3GB was okay  2GB is just to get people to "upgrade" and pay more... well guess what... it won't fly
Agreed @DavidBflower @giffgaff @WhichUK am now considering moving provider... it's not on to do this... not with the profits being made!
My way of celebrating the awesome @LastManOnMoon ... and yes that last one IS Gene's personal cue card for Apollo 17 https://t.co/FaWULRrLKY
@GNU_Ninja I have  and to a man  they are all incredible... My 10yo has met 4 of them  and Al Worden is her fave
@GNU_Ninja Jack is and was a legend for sure... Gene has always been a hero to me though
All of us at @Spacefest would like to thank one of our amazing sponsors. One of the team behind @LastManOnMoon The awesome #HavilandDigital
@GabrielleNYC @thedrive I'd imaging a bit slower than doing it at 25 000mph ;-) #apollo15
@geoffnotkin @MeteoritesAZ minor rock star .. Lol
@WiredUK Your reviwer is clearly incompetent - https://t.co/Ldk7LgGK88   but then you always get one I guess
91% so far on @RottenTomatoes for @LastManOnMoon proves that it is pretty much universally loved by everyone...
Wow. Matt Reynolds at @WiredUK I'd love to know what film you saw  as that review is beyond a joke!
@sparklefingered @LastManOnMoon U.S side I think they have some agreements in place. UK I hope "watch this space"... BUT see it in Cinema!
If you're booked to see @LastManOnMoon this week and are even thinking of pulling out... trust me DON'T... the film is utterly outstanding
@pilliarscreatio Mike is not no...
@pilliarscreatio When/after it's signed at Spacefest I will ;-)
@Cosmic_Carol Also DBS is useful
@WilMcQueen @NASAJPL @NolaTRedd Did find a load of asteroids ... ;-) (and assist on a few comets - https://t.co/GdmGdjxX5K
@WilMcQueen @NASAJPL @NolaTRedd no... but tricky to type on mobile :-)
@bbc5live Want to talk meteorites w/Director of World's largest meteorite company? DM...
@WillGompertzBBC @bbc5live @NaughtyBoyMusic @ben_watt @claraamfo @GrainneMaguire @Rosiemillard meteorite talk..!!!
@bbc5live just saw @WillGompertzBBC is talking meteorites ..check my profile ..happy to chat on air
Ha ..#TheHuntsman may be trending  but the greatest UK film release coming in April is @LastManOnMoon by a country mile!!
Film critics and their reviews usually suck... not when the @LastManOnMoon reviews #TheMartian https://t.co/UvzSPHVo5X #differentballgame
Ramp up the awesome... @LastManOnMoon UK release info - https://t.co/qjiBtuOAJ4
@TheAntmagic @geoffnotkin @MeteoriteMen @MHUnlimited @RAWAstro looks real and interesting
@markmccaughrean outstanding player... will be sorely missed and way too young to die
@pilliarscreatio @Spacefest Al and Dave are there!
@pilliarscreatio Oh yes! ... I have the mission reports signed  that's nice!
@markmccaughrean #tumbleweed #wagner
@GNU_Ninja @markmccaughrean @geoffnotkin We have a sale on too!
@GNU_Ninja @markmccaughrean @geoffnotkin happy to help
@iamscicomm Mafia style backstabbing by some members of the community would get my vote
One for @FakeAstropix of the Mercury Transit (in May) featuring @DrBrianMay (H/T Pete Ainsworth for image) https://t.co/tgEUMOErrC
@pilliarscreatio Yup  and one of the few locations you can show your kids with clarity and say "look that's where a spacecraft landed"
@pilliarscreatio Hadley and the Feather drop  plus Al is a good buddy
@DavidBrockley Next week Charlie Bolden says that "Richard Feynman was an asshat who really didn't get physics" ;-)
@Blackprojects I may well be :-)
@pilliarscreatio Always  I have about 18 talks lined up so far this year
@faulkestel @Blackprojects Packaging them all up now (was at home yesterday so limitede network access). Remote scheduled scope not ideal
@Blackprojects no definite yet
@markmccaughrean @ESA_ExoMars @bbcworldservice @KCBSNews may have imaged your little spacecraft in orbit Mark..twice https://t.co/9pDjrmkhJo
@ruthie147 Hear hear!...
@hastroparr "boom boom boom" by the Black Eyed Peas? ;-)
Median was a nanolander developed by myself and @Jane_MacArthur set to detect methane concentrations on Mars. Worked on some years ago
@TheAntmagic @geoffnotkin @MeteoriteMen love love love
@milind_kawli @JPMajor @AstroAnarchy Oh he will be the Republican nominee  how scary is that!?
@JPMajor @AstroAnarchy His brown skin shining in the sun... his hair quiffed back... radio on ....
@TomWatts28 I'll Dm you Tom
@grb090423 @FGW every day .. But today is staggeringly bad
@DownHereOnEarth Dm'd you info
@sciencefocus I think the word you're looking for isn't "haunting" it's "Depressing"
@daverothery All set for transit coverage from Geneva!
@thehighfrontier @Cosmic_Carol They should  they're about as reliable as a Trabant
@grb090423 @Cosmic_Carol @esa indeed... would be a nice first
@Cosmic_Carol If I were ESA... I'd be bricking it on that fact...
@Cosmic_Carol bear this in mind... not one Russian launched vehicle has EVER successfully made it to the surface of Mars and worked
@Blackprojects @MeteoritesAZ I am indeed! and meteorites!
@markmccaughrean @ESA_ExoMars Very best of luck with that one
@martiansoil @ESA_ExoMars Best of luck with that one
@hastroparr @geoffnotkin Doesn't look meteoritic :-(
@CNET How most people outside of the USA feel.. h/t to my good buddy Kyle Sullivan for the artwork https://t.co/Ed2WTIBOTH
If you're in London ... DO NOT MISS THIS! - https://t.co/NBzaL9y26S @BIS_spaceflight Don is an awesome speaker!! @astro_DonThomas
@BIS_spaceflight @sgcsalmon @NASA @astro_DonThomas Don is so great. We loved him at @cosmicon and will see him at @Spacefest
@AstroAnarchy @FoxNews @CNN @DailyMailUK I'd also like to see science reporters who have legit twitter followers  not fake ones!
@AstroAnarchy Well  between @foxnews @cnn and @DailyMailUK I think any notion of science reporting went out the window a long time ago
Shout out for all friends of both me and @MeteoriteMen to support this remarkable lady and her bid to do #epicstuff https://t.co/oR0HbVk4Cr
My awesome friend @Jane_MacArthur needs support to help her win one of only 8 places to visit ESO plz RT her pinned post! #astronomy #space
@Jane_MacArthur @astro_timpeake @cns_school @NorwichSchool @ReephamHigh oooh you're doing one of them too!...cool
@Jon_Berkemeyer I was only focussing on the technical aspects ;-)
@hastroparr To show what incompetent coding looks like?
@Blackprojects Thank you Mark
@unknownsymmetry Mission reports..... unbeatable
@sciencemuseum @Damien_Wev @norfolkbookworm Note... test your servers ;-)
@SerendipitySays from the deflection sensitivity I saw/read/reported on  they may need to
@JeffreyRSnively @starstryder I don't know  I've seen those !
@JeffreyRSnively @starstryder Nothing was official unless you had the embargoed PR ;-)
For all of you who use iTunes... the incredible @LastManOnMoon movie is one to own - https://t.co/XRzBPDZUwc #apollo #space
@AstroExeter She's on the literal top of my top 10 list of people in life I want to meet and just say "Thank you" to
Congrats to the immense @LastManOnMoon team for their superb award https://t.co/ZChDxH4YYV #apollo #legend #Cernan #space #astronomy
@DavidGalvin9 Picking up easily on an FSQ106 in 30s
@DavidGalvin9 14.2 from a stack of 5 images ref UCAC
@DavidGalvin9 Abouty 14.5 according to astrometrica from one image  but I'd rather get more data on it
@romn8tr @SpaceX I have not heard
@fattcslim78 @carolynporco seconded
@timmermansr Research done over 50 years ago... all great! Give someone a kick will you  the delay line is making it almost impossible
@timmermansr  ablation ;-)
@DawnSunrise1 yeah "chasing squid" (aka low frequency submarine sonar completely screwing them over)
@PeoplesAstro @cosmos4u @BBCNews @BBCWorld its on sky news now
@janeway47 @SkyNews Sky featured him just now ... @BBCNews should be ashamed
@pete20cwt @PeoplesAstro @cosmos4u @BBCNews @BBCWorld sky news showed him .. Excellent
@PeoplesAstro @cosmos4u @BBCNews @BBCWorld and how wrong is that .!!
@pilliarscreatio @elliottucker @BBCNews well said
@Blackprojects @BBCNews just up.. Wupdeedoo
@cosmos4u @BBCNews @BBCWorld I saw ...
@cottonscience @MeteoriteMen or a StrewnField of Scientists
@MeteoriteMen A Matrix of meteoritehunters
@GabrielleNYC very!!.... #ripoffbritain #ukgovt #tax
Interesting from @airandspace mag - https://t.co/z2zMkmywKs
@timmermansr @sciencemuseum It's a stunning exhibition... you'll love it
@Blackprojects @Astro_yyz It is ... but we're still looking
@astrotomato How... just how...
@HAL9000and1 Get @geoffnotkin 's superb book on the subject   and get thee to a known strewn field (desert locations = good)
@markmccaughrean @AstroExeter having had science data stolen by "professionals" on more than one occasion  I see very little difference ;-)
@AquilaRift @markmccaughrean @cosmos4u I put in inordinate amounts of work to imaging (and the science aspects) so it baffles me too
@markmccaughrean owch... well  he's been had and admitted it @cosmos4u I think knows more about the whole saga
@markmccaughrean Signed copy :-)
@markmccaughrean All over Facebook  astronomy forums it seems
@markmccaughrean and the guy who took it has now admitted he faked it and has removed his image from website
@markmccaughrean The image composite is impossible  given the frame rates and definition on Saturn
@AstrogatorJohn @apod no  some good photoshoppping
One for @FakeAstropix https://t.co/meb3f2IakU The "APOD" that isn't @apod
@hastroparr @apod anyone with a basic knowledge of astro imaging would have
So the @apod is a fraud (The Saturn ISS transit) and NOBODY spotted it at APOD... wow...
@Cosmic_Carol @Spacefest awesomeness!!!
@Cosmic_Carol @Spacefest Are you coming Carol!.... eeep!!
@TakeThatNASA No  I have enjoyed the laugh at the morons who post on your feed.. ;-)
Oh I just found my new fave Twitter account @TakeThatNASA ... Follow  and just relish in the joy of the idiocy of people
@merciajew @TakeThatNASA @MikeSainty @almurray No  I feel the same as I have for the past 46 years

The @LastManOnMoon will be one of THREE films shown at @Spacefest in June
@RussianSpaceWeb There's a reason you're on my space history panel at @spacefest Great work as ever
@SpaceKate yay!!!... go Kate go !!!
@HAL9000and1 now THAT was a Shuttle flight!!... That up to about STS6 and then the HST repair missions... all amazing
@HAL9000and1 Wait until you see the film... it's incredible @LastManOnMoon
@StellarPlanet I love giving talks stateside  for that very reason
@HAL9000and1 I do indeed... but Gene is my astro ... an icon of STEM and outreach
@HAL9000and1 His heart rate monitor readings at launch and descent to lunar surface are legendary #coolasacucumber
@HAL9000and1 Young is the "astronauts' astronaut" Gemini  Apollo and STS  still to be beaten..Sadly quite poorly these days  but amazing man
@HAL9000and1 McCandless was capcom on Apollo... in those days  they took risks  and they paid off   big styke
@StellarPlanet aye  nice for the 8th time  this is very true
@HAL9000and1 Still in LEO   but yes  great point an epic and iconic thing that also got canned for being too risky
If you want to see part of this  recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic you can tonight @BBCStargazing at #lacock https://t.co/QQPrnY4t9r
NASA check stamps on this also indicate used for launch of @LastManOnMoon See it TONIGHT at #lacock @BBCStargazing https://t.co/hYi0eV9PPG

Just a thought... start @BBCStargazing tomorrow with "Space Oddity"
@BIS_spaceflight @BIS_spaceflight I would be delighted to support you guys
@DavidGalvin9 @BBC_ARoadshow That's showbiz!... They were great though  and I was there for over an hour being filmed
@rincon_p @markmccaughrean @BBCAmos @jjaron Indeed...
@rincon_p @markmccaughrean @BBCAmos @jjaron I agree. Shame also is that he's a genuinely great guy all round
@rincon_p @markmccaughrean @BBCAmos @jjaron "First official British astronaut to conduct historic spacewalk"..
@rincon_p @markmccaughrean @BBCAmos @jjaron ha ha ha!
@rincon_p @markmccaughrean @BBCAmos @jjaron "official British" is only two
@rincon_p @markmccaughrean @BBCAmos @jjaron Paul  thank you.. It was that the headline was misleading in opinion of many
@markmccaughrean @RainerKresken See the film first Mark  the book is vastly superior  and less "artistic" lic used
@markmccaughrean @AstroExeter I just worry that if we ever do find Snoopy  what will lurk within https://t.co/75iKzZTNUG
@AstroExeter @markmccaughrean "poopy in Snoopy" :-)
@markmccaughrean Well know... the "poopy in Snoopy" incident ;-)
@markmccaughrean @geoffnotkin we will sort you out some delicious Seymchan or Fukang no doubt
@markmccaughrean @BBCAmos @jjaron @rincon_p Ptolemy and Cosac ;)
@BBCAmos @markmccaughrean @jjaron @rincon_p now now Jon ;)
@markmccaughrean @jjaron @rincon_p @BBCAmos Jon is always spot on... superb journalist  IMHO one of the very best
@ESA_History @IFLScience I know :) it's not their fault
@ESA_History @IFLScience but I guess it makes  for better reading ;)
@ESA_History @IFLScience only because it was the only way to get a flight .. :(
@ESA_History @IFLScience he and Piers are British ..
@ESA_History @IFLScience which is correct !!
@astrotomato Monopoly is one of the world's leading games... seems ...just stupid really
@astrotomato not "rubbish"   I think it just highlighted a stupid marketing mistake by a group of toy vendors in excluding main character
@astrotomato There are  but surely all of them should include her  given she's the main character!

@Pahnl @GCAstroOutreach @hastroparr @The_Herbert But you carry on with your "art" and I'll keep trying to dispel crud and enjoy Turner et al
@Pahnl @GCAstroOutreach @hastroparr @The_Herbert and your disclaimer  "kids saying they loved it" will take home tosh as fact.. v upsetting
@Pahnl @GCAstroOutreach @hastroparr @The_Herbert It's difficult enough dealing with 27% of people thinking we didn't land on the Moon!
@DavidGalvin9 green
@DavidGalvin9 That and some good triangulation on this and the Argentina strike
@DavidGalvin9 confirmed
@JP_Astronomy @AstroExeter @TimBurgess @Cosmic_Carol @hastroparr @DaveEagle45 @Johnimus_Prime @RonBaalke TY!

@russss @vruba Color balance is a tricky topic  but key thing is that DSCOVR shows true global geometry; the Suomi NPP image does not.
@dcastelvecchi Earlier publication implies 2 part strategy: local soil only first  then added nitrogen for harvest. https://t.co/CKnOvfe3z0
@LonelyProbe Uh oh--the moon is escaping anyway  just very slowly (about 3.8 cm/year). We're going to need a stronger lasso.
@DavidHesperos Implication is that it's been slowly freezing pretty much that whole time. We just caught it before the final stage.
@DavidHesperos @gmusser Presence of expansion faults indicates partial freezing; absence of large subsidence implies not fully frozen.
@dcastelvecchi Maybe a gateway to an international moon base  which would be genuinely exciting...

@Rand_Simberg @carolynporco @SciGuySpace The rocket is happening regardless. At least going to Europa yields a big scientific payoff.

@Rainmaker1973 You could try to fake it with the Great Comet of 1882  its alleged cousin... ;)
@Rainmaker1973 No  I mean the image from the Bayeux Tapestry. Isn't that definitively linked to Halley's Comet?
@Rainmaker1973 But that is Halley's Comet from 1066  no?
@AsteroidEnergy Hmmm...Jeff Foust also heard 1.5  Julie Rathbun heard 2.5. @AlanStern will know the true answer!
@RichardFPenn @Rand_Simberg It's unknown (unknowable?) whether Columbus made an intentional error  assuming he'd make landfall anyway.
@brianwolven Boom.

@sandygrains Not nitpicky. Ejected ice giant is the most plausible origin (if real)--very different than a super-Earth.
@sandygrains Agreed. Authors get best fit with "a few" 10s of Me  which would definitely not be a super-Earth.
@toktokalweer1ei @tedstryk Agree--the current planet definition feels very provisional  and does not cover exoplanets at all.

@StartsWithABang @MarianneScheid If anything big were heading toward Earth  it would be headline news everywhere. No way it would be secret.
@StartsWithABang (and I will stop trying to dispute Dave Jewitt  since he knows about 10**100 times as much about these things as I do)
@StartsWithABang [clears throat] So  um  as I was saying  it is a dead asteroid  or "rock comet."
@StartsWithABang That's my question: Volatile loss means you can never get a stable crust on a comet?
@boundangle @StartsWithABang Water is very abundant  cosmically speaking. Making it is easy; keeping it is the bigger issue.
@StartsWithABang Wouldn't a baked KBO with a dehydrated silicate mantle look a lot like an asteroid? Or are there just too much volatiles?
@StartsWithABang OK  prob an asteroidal "rock comet"! But couldn't the same mechanism affect a dehydrated comet? https://t.co/83SMJw3I9v
@Rainmaker1973 Where did you find those ALMA visualizations? Very helpful.
@thomassturm @LeeBillings Could be 1/4 the size of Ceres (if btwn Saturn &amp; Uranus) or as big as Neptune (if distant). Or might not be real.

@Rainmaker1973 (I was actually agreeing with you!)
@Rainmaker1973 @cosmos4u Doesn't 1st observation of pulses count as 1st observation that recognized it as a pulsar?
@albiondumsday About 600 million light years away--not that far in the cosmic sense  but way beyond our local galaxy cluster.
@skdh @AstroKatie @RobertGaristo How is it wrong to say the LHC is recreating the QGP conditions of the (post)BB? Asking seriously.
@skdh @AstroKatie @RobertGaristo I meant BB as shorthand to include the QGP era of 10**-5 seconds--reasonable in 140 characters  I think.

@sneakin @brokeymcpoverty Is that a bad thing?! (I personally feel weird doing it because I'm from NY  but a few years in VA counts  right?)
@gstalnaker Aww!!
@gstalnaker Aww! We love our weirdo doggers.
@gstalnaker Right?! They are complex creatures with a whole lot of feelings and instincts! Not just inert teddy bears.
@gstalnaker It's hard because other dogs are THE MOST INTERESTING THING IN THE WORLD to her.
@gstalnaker We've been through training and tried a lot of techniques. Her name and a high value treat seem to be the best distractors
@gstalnaker A bit! She's now about 6 years old. Adopted her two years ago.
@MichaelJewell78 She's wonderful at off-leash play  though  with dogs who are similarly social. Daycare is the best thing ever.
@MichaelJewell78 Yeah  she sees another dog and WANTS TO SNIFF THEM AND GREET THEM AND OMG WHY CANT I GET TO YOU FREAK OUT
@gstalnaker Also the top clip harness made her pull harder. Size makes a big difference in what works for your dog
@gstalnaker Wow  really??? I tried a retractable lead once and hated it! But my dog is 45 lbs so it was useless with her.
@MichaelJewell78 Yeah it gets her turned away like it should  be she's still agitated and barking like a nutter.
@MichaelJewell78 It's so funny... I literally have a closet full of leashes  harnesses  etc that we've tried :-P
@MichaelJewell78 distract with treat and move quickly are my best options. We use a martingale chain collar that has worked best
@MichaelJewell78 Thanks! Tried that! Didn't quite work for her.
@DrMRFrancis @seelix you know I realized that a Hillary presidency means more KMK as pres on SNL. I'm so for that.

@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy Ah  that's certainly good in theory  but respectability politics is tired  e.g. https://t.co/aChHMMUVot
@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy I see a LOT more of people telling #BlackLivesMatter and others to be quiet  like that's going to make racism better
@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy i'm no constitutional scholar  but pretty sure ppl are legally allowed to be racist asshats. I'm not happy about it
@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy depends what they are doing. Even vile speech is constitutionally protected. Crosses line at inciting violence
@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy Sure. They have a right to speak and to protest. ppl asking these protestors to stop are sayin take racism quietly

@tanyaofmars No one collects samples here. And I've offered to do it for them and they are like  "no  it's a process." WUT
@DavidBflower Thanks!!!
@PlanetDr Hmmm... I need to work on that. We DO have a pub on our campus!
@DrMRFrancis I'm so glad they got a statement from Aaron Parsons in there. But the beginning and other parts are so troublesome.
@albertoconti @Discovery @blakebullock Nice!
@albertoconti @Discovery Catching the rebroadcast. Did I just see you in a bunny suit?
@astrogrant @PeterDEdmonds I've been accused of being part of the "black hole conspiracy."
@sondy @xeni @michael_w_busch I get it. Aliens are amazeballs. I'm teaching a course about the topic this semester :-)
@ChipotleTweets Thanks!
Never got my #raincheck offer code from texting @ChipotleTweets last week. Maybe it went to that guy in DC I'm hearing about on @waitwait?
@Nerdista @DrMRFrancis If ONLY the great hair came standard
@wdonohue @prenerk OMG crooked earred dogs just look CUTER
@prenerk Ew. That's ridiculous. Humans are ew.
@MarsRoverUH Oof
@fizzixrat @MarsRoverUH hard as I try... it never comes out
@MarsRoverUH Um  maybe knees and back  too
@MarsRoverUH Young at heart is all that matters!
@DNLee5 @shaka_lulu @IBJIYONGI @aomawa @Summer_Ash @ThePurplePage *hugs* you are all amazing ladies!
@mikamckinnon Hahaha I hadn't seen this yet! If I have time between class prep? Are there instructions somewhere or just go for it?
@NGC3314 But then I'd have to pay attention to pop culture! :-P
@CatherineQ @starstryder dammit I missed that one walking the dog
@RyanWVoll @AstroAnarchy @ThreeIfBySpace :-(
@RyanWVoll @AstroAnarchy *grump* what about https://t.co/cZUkjThcde ?
@kejames both parties are faculty/staff/commuter parking stealers  really. #BigIssues
@kejames YUP. But so did the December Dem debate.
@starstryder https://t.co/mozt2Wzqk9
@reneehlozek That's what actually caused the screaming... Just hoping that wasn't any of my students/colleagues....
@DrMRFrancis All I'm saying is that they better disinfect that fitness center before they reopen it.
@DrMRFrancis They were treating the pre-debate like a pre-game show
@DrMRFrancis DON'T KNOW WHAT I"M TALKING ABOUT? HERE IS A GOOGLE! :-P
@DrMRFrancis Thank you for taking me off that thread as it got started. You have far more patience than I do.
@fcain Pretty pretty VLBI blobs
@VealSlab That's just too early for kids. Sheesh
@VealSlab oof!
@VealSlab Honestly  my dog has been waking me at 5am for potty anyway  I think thats the only reason it's plausible that I'll be up
@DrMRFrancis Kind of hard to make mandatory unless I want to hold a lot of them. Which I don't :-P
@DrMRFrancis I'm not sure I want to get out of bed that early. Plus I have to schedule last minute b/c weather.
@merrdiff Only one pic means you were having too much fun to take pictures! :-)
@merrdiff @annafrebel Cool! I like the better accuracy  but might be a bit jargon-y for my purpose in class. But that I can work with...
Cool! h/t @merrdiff  https://t.co/Rtdca0mFzR
@The_NobleWoman We're about to have our second on-campus debate. Screws up everything for a solid week.
@LMFinney @SurlyAmy Yup  it was custom. There is an itty bitty Martian meteorite inside the glass vial
@sondy @Summer_Ash Which season? I used to prefer 5 but lately I've been feeling 7
@kelleytastic I'm breaking that rule just for Mulder and Scully
@kelleytastic D'oh! At least you didn't miss it
@DrRubidium Are you kidding?! I wouldn't even call a dog a half-breed. WTF
@Gee_Kate @paganforge @OmanReagan Indeed!! :-)
@MasaCritit OMG right?! The Solar System fits in my pocket except the Oort Cloud  yeah that's down the street.
@shubclimate Some people might be panicking that their bad behavior will be made public  but the harassment has been going on for long time
@DrMRFrancis did they have pitchforks?
Since the quantitative analysis intro lab made everyone just about cry last semester... cc @starstryder @PatrickDurrell
@danwest it'll be required viewing for the class!
@poniosun @baserunner0723 @ulalaunch likewise
@Blkwooly platinum  gold  refractory metals...
@CJDaniels77 Yes. But you have to come to ULA to fond out
@Blkwooly Only at first.  CisLunar space has abundant supplies of fuel and other resources rare on earth
@CJDaniels77 Ask me after the 8th
@SpaceBrendan @codydschultz Vocation  not a degree. Endless possibilities.  32 yrs  &gt;26 rockets  9 hyprsncs  4 lasers...and I'm still going
@Kalti @ArtOfAstronomy  The notches are there to support alignment fixtures. Once motors are aligned  we back-fill with cork and thermal RTV
@ArtOfAstronomy The notches are there to support alignment fixtures. Once motors are aligned  we back-fill with cork and thermal RTV
@CJDaniels77 Unlikely to see a complete abandonment of SRBs
@CJDaniels77 I like to think of it as a metaphor for the challenge of transformation...
.@GreenJimll @elonmusk We kept ABL at Edwards AFB when the secret base under the volcano wasn't available  ;)
@Zerstaubung @ulalaunch @PointyEndUp @SpaceflightNow Sounds good to me.  I like to add a dash of RP1 for a little extra spiceyness
@mlelak3 @ulalaunch Thank you
@Fingersoup @ExoSpaceHQ @FortuneMagazine Working it
@davidrherron @usairforce Sadly  yes
@stromspace definitely hydrogen. I'm all about green ;)
@PhilipJLinden @ExoSpaceHQ @FortuneMagazine Kind of a self answering question. Competition is healthy. As long as it is a fair &amp; level field
@Zerstaubung @ulalaunch @SpaceflightNow Heaviest  and those with complex orbit insertions involving long coasts and re-ignitions
@SullivansProjs @Cosmic_Carol @chriscwharris @NOAA  Mighty Atlas is powerful and uniquely able to operate for many hours in space
.@NatReconOfc @airandspace Cool aircraft.  My fluid mechanics Prof worked it and often regaled us with stories
@dslsynth Yes  but... Rocky McRocketface will not be allowed ;)
@dslsynth Yup
@dslsynth Not that I recall  but it was multi-national
@KayDesigner @ulalaunch Thank you
@AustinOnSocial He hung out. Snuck in  stole food.Waited under porch every morning to grab Greatgranma's ankle &amp; hear her holler.Mischevious
@roach Me too ;)
@AustinOnSocial Poor guy. Had a "pet" raccoon when I was a kid. Hit by a car. Nursed him back to health. Wouldn't leave...
@JRascagneres @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Busy time.  Give it a week
@roach Shhhhh.....;)
@wikkit @rocketrepreneur @lars_0 So I've heard...
@JRascagneres @ulalaunch Yes
@CJDaniels77 you are the first
@KayDesigner yup
@JRascagneres @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx send your address to corp comms on our website and I'll send a care pkg
@JRascagneres @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Space inspires everyone
@stromspace you know it
@dslsynth interesting idea
@dslsynth easier to make it on earth. Can store LOX LH2 on orbit for several years
@themarkashley @johnmknight @LEGOIdeas i figured it out
@OrbitalATK @NASA_Wallops Congrats
@SRodgerBock @elonmusk Yes  it is
@dslsynth Classified;)
@dslsynth Already done it ;)
@OrbitalATK @NASA Good luck
@baserunner0723 @ulalaunch Cool
@stevenkwatts @wardniner @OSIRISREx @DSLauretta send his coordinates to corp comms at https://t.co/3i19OWVoKh  we'll send a pkg @ulalaunch
@sarahcruddas my favorite city up north. Have fun
@Astro_Zach Not the one you're thinking of
@OrbitalATK @VCSFA_MARS @NASA_Wallops @NASASocial Fine looking group.  Good hunting
@DougonTech Caught it as a UK bird
@dougperry2006 I like the way you think
@blytheverse @SciGuySpace good eye ;)
@BryanKeIIy @MerlinTheEngine @stromspace interesting
@the_ss_caleb @ulalaunch Demand fell off
@the_ss_caleb @ulalaunch Yes  but near the end. Last launch in a year  year and a half.
@AndrewNCassidy @ulalaunch right
@baserunner0723 @ulalaunch 422
@baserunner0723 @ulalaunch We routinely exceed classical terminal velocity.  So the speed necessary to destroy would be "Ludicrous Speed" ;)
@Hywel95 @ulalaunch @BoeingDefense @NASA not really
@dslsynth @george_sowers The lighter gray skirt is new
@John_Gardi @BigelowSpace @ulalaunch Bob and I have spent a lot of time together....
@dslsynth @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing Getting better. Expect a date to return to ops from USAF soon
@NASASpaceflight @CwG_NSF Looking forward to sending this technological wonder on its way
@HolsMichael @ulalaunch Timing and also the availability of Mariner
@doug_ellison @NASASpaceflight @waynehale Thanks  but I'm just to busy changing the future of space ;)
@dslsynth Very unusual situation
@thatspacegeek @ulalaunch Yes.  Many evacuated from their homes. Checking on everyone now
@captainkirkxc @HolsMichael @ulalaunch thanks
@dslsynth We'll assess that over the next few days.  Today was a quick survey. Teams of personnel  quickly fanned out over our facilities
@KayDesigner @Astro_Zach @NobbeChristine @NSS_StL @ulalaunch Congrats
@dslsynth thanks
@WinterBynes The next one (always).
@DanPX2 Positioned horizontal (one stand alone vertical Centaur).  Secured.  Building battened down.  Mariner sent to safe waters
@dslsynth @ulalaunch @george_sowers @aiaa Thanks
@NzoVito Drop us a line.  Also lots of of Aerospace here in Colorado
@LameLefty @Robotbeat Stages at the Cape.  Down and buttoned up tight inside the buildings.  Stages on the Mariner  sent her to safe waters
@sparklefingered  Advice on this one might be a bit above my pay grade.  Really tough situation.  My sympathies
@Robotbeat @SurfaceWinds yup
@Rocket_AtlasV @ulalaunch Thanks.  Most of our hardware is in the horizontal with facilities buttoned up tight.  Our people evacuated
@dslsynth Ooooo  nice
@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch of course
@SurfaceWinds @Robotbeat Yes  but I'll have no people there to launch it
@Robotbeat Atlas/Delta provide very unique capabilities.  Battening down the hatches.  Personnel safety is the first priority
@KayDesigner One of my many talents ;)
@blueorigin @SpaceflightIns Cool pic
@Destructor111 Outdoors
@stratohornet USAF assessing when the base to resume flight ops. Hope to have an answer soon
@Astro_Zach Jeff is very cool. But also a very humble and serious person
@dslsynth yes. Very loud
@malderi @Robotbeat working my third cup now
@NanoRacks yup. Pretty early. ;)
@JohnMcGauley Don't know yet  but we can turn a launch very quickly if weather permits and the base can support
@John_Gardi @NatReconOfc I could tell you  but... ;)
@johnkrausphotos yes. Very cool. Thank you!
@julia_bergeron @ulalaunch kneel down transporter. I don't recognize the piece of tooling @ulalaunch
@theWeatherboy we have a set of standard procedures. Not our first rodeo
@KSpaceAcademy controlled explosion  creating a Meg of thrust  fed by 10s of 1000s of hp  in a pkg the size of a fridge... timeless style
@KSpaceAcademy Soooo KSP says engines are the mullet of the rocket. Hmmm.  ;)
@HolsMichael @ulalaunch I have no spcl insight into failure investigation. Been trying not acknowledge preposterous third party speculation
@ChrisDMarshall @ulalaunch Not yet.  The Western Range is still assessing when they can resume Flight Ops
@RealAntonioM @ulalaunch @30thSpaceWing Not yet.  USAF is still assessing when they can return to flight ops
@RealAntonioM @ulalaunch @30thSpaceWing USAF still assessing when they can return to flight operations
@DanPX2  Better question for SX. I have No special insight into the failure investigation. Safety transcends competition in this industry
@Astro_Zach @NASAWatch  @ulalaunch Private companies lease facilities at CCAFS. SMARF is &gt;1 mile from SLC39. We store equipment there
@rappolee @ulalaunch @julia_bergeron resend
@davidrherron @NASASpaceflight We are the truck.  Others do capsules.  But... Vulcan/ACES is a really big truck...
@rappolee @julia_bergeron @ulalaunch expect 11 or 12 in 2017. Starting off with an NSS
@Rocket_AtlasV @BoeingDefense 2 solids
@NASASpaceflight I'd say the first several hundred
@GalileoMoon @ulalaunch Don't know yet
@dlandinglegs @prezcannady @DougonTech @elonmusk The great discovery of our time:  Water is everywhere
@dlandinglegs I have worked with many competimates over the years when that was needed to make the customer's mission succeed
@BrewCityChaser @GalileoMoon @GrahamBowes @ulalaunch @Cosmic_Carol drop a line to corp communications
@sparklefingered Garnet.
@dslsynth @freek_dekker So long  and thanks for all the fish  ;)
@DougonTech @elonmusk Doing my part. I believe a self-sustaining #CisLunar1000 economy is essential to all other perm off Earth endeavors
@NASA_Nerd @ulalaunch congrats. likewise
@Cosmic_Carol @ulalaunch cool
@GalileoMoon @ulalaunch awesome
@Cosmic_Carol @ulalaunch likewise
@richsnod will be retired by ACES. Probably need a better name for that revolutionary capability
@davidrherron @Znapel No. Atlas will continue on RD180. Vulcan will fly in 2019 with a BE4 or about a year later if we downselect to AR1
@chip_snyder @NASASpaceflight (This is why I have a dog....)
@AuerSusan A thing of beauty ;)
@romn8tr Exactly
@ULAEngineer @ulalaunch We'll see what we can do
@Astro_Adept @ASLaunchers @ulalaunch send corp email you address. Tell them I sent you
@Astro_Adept @rocketrepreneur Shhhh....
@Rocket_AtlasV @ulalaunch me too
@LPLobinske We do.  @ulalaunch  How can we make that happen?
@RuthFieldBeck1 Likewise
@dslsynth Yes.  31 years this November
@omcintyre @ulalaunch @Crow_T_Robot Very sad news
@wardniner @ulalaunch @EPN473 @VCFD Very sad news indeed
@AustinOnSocial https://t.co/RnOUTXORpX
@stratohornet Also appears safe at present
@lexcalibur100 @legoclone09 yes
@legoclone09 @KSpaceAcademy Too busy launching rockets and changing the future of space
@aWildLupiDragon IDK. @ulalaunch
@joaosg @legoclone09 sure. Email us on the website
@dslsynth Detanked after prior attempt.  Interesting idea  but not really practical starting from this point.
@dslsynth Mostly.  The ISS Cargo InfoG touched on RAAN Steering
@JohnMcGauley Dedicated teams with common engineering support in Centennial
@SLC4_LZ2 @DragonWindow @ulalaunch Over 600 firefighters are working this fire as hard as they can
@DragonWindow @ulalaunch Thanks. Done everything we can. Buttoned her up tight. Back in the MSP. Clean atmo with positive pressure  etc
@DragonWindow @ulalaunch depends on how much time we'd have
@kycutter2914 @ulalaunch @Crow_T_Robot @ChrisDMarshall @SecAF23 Don't know yet
@legoclone09 go to our website.  email corp comms.  Tell them I sent you
@A_M_Swallow @TrampolinRocket @ChrisDMarshall @ulalaunch Alas  no
@TFDeaconTAZ @SpaceHedge @ulalaunch @elonmusk you might want to visit our Youtube channel and check out some of the Vulcan rocket vids
@ChrisDMarshall @Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch  thanks
@Crow_T_Robot @ChrisDMarshall @SecAF23 @ulalaunch I feel well protected by the outstanding USAF Operations and Firefighting teams
@ChrisDMarshall @ulalaunch closer than I would like. Birds secure. Firefighters ready if needed. Launch date still good
@ACosmicObserver @ulalaunch Bird and S/C are secured.  USAF firefighters have resources nearby should they be needed.
@John_Gardi yes. We have a USG launch from VAFB before the end of the year
@dslsynth @ulalaunch Always
@baserunner0723 tower designs provide lots of access and commodities  while giving lift off clearance
@John_Gardi not like an interplanetary. Windows governed by pad and base operations
@RocketmanJRS @ulalaunch @30thSpaceWing thanks
@johnkrausphotos @ulalaunch nice
@astro_navis @ulalaunch Unfortunately  there is a wildfire interfering with operations.  Keep an eye on the news reports
@mymultipass Dilithium crystal misalignment ;)
@dslsynth The very definition of irony.  But... WV will be able to see you ;)
@tehWKD 1 hr  24 minutes from now
@taliaeliana @GoZeroG Good luck
@AustinOnSocial Almost as exciting as launching #WorldView4
@wardniner It will get much more exciting in about an hour and 37 minutes
@DavidBflower thanks
@AustinOnSocial Yes
@Screpheep @ulalaunch Because #OSIRISREx is on an interplanetary trajectory  so is Centaur.  This makes escape the most efficient disposal
@chrisadams2112 bit heavy for us
@chrisadams2112 not really our mission
@katrobison @ulalaunch interesting question. Reach iut to jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch with that one
@adolfgatonegro @OSIRISREx Thanks
@John_Gardi @BlairBigelow @JeffBezos Well said
@Astro_Zach @elonmusk I did...
@AnnaDotBlue @wardniner @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch @UofA @SpaceflightIns That too ;)
@RealAntonioM @NASASocial @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch @NASAKennedy @ExploreSpaceKSC Send us a note in the website.  I'll send you some swag
@legoclone09 Always ;)
@sparklefingered you are very welcome. Cool art
@WinterBynes @Astro_Zach @blueorigin absolutely
@HolsMichael @ulalaunch Its coming
@Tschnn @IAC2016 @ulalaunch Not this time
@wardniner @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch @UofA @SpaceflightIns We could not do our job without the amazing support of the USAF and KSC
@DougonTech @On2Space @ulalaunch I kind of like the idea of one-click space launch ordering ;)
@HolsMichael @ulalaunch yup
@HolsMichael @ulalaunch mail it to our offices in Centennial
@spaceloss @LocutusF @elonmusk No truer words...
@BostonSpaceOrg @ulalaunch @NOAA Keep an eye our our feed.  We'll keep the Pgo current (it's usually about the weather)
@johnkrausphotos @ulalaunch Just hit the "contact ULA" on the website.  Tell them I sent you
@Astro_Zach @blueorigin Good luck!
@NASASpaceflight Darn.  Missed it. No longer up.  If Kayne really wants to go to space  we've got his ride ;)
@Astro_Zach @GalileoMoon @JPMajor likewise
@johnkrausphotos Must be pretty old.  Send @ulalaunch your address  and we'll send you some better posters
@dslsynth practice.
@JPMajor @AstroAnarchy likewise
@wardniner @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch @NASA quite the artist
@marsbeyond @rocketrepreneur @LarsTheWanderer @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch among other things...
@rappolee Drop my PAO a line.  Jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com
@legoclone09 @OSIRISREx cool
@rappolee Idk yet
@ARJules @LarsTheWanderer @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch sounds just about right to me
@HipeRFin @DJSnM @ulalaunch cool idea  @ulalaunch
@FuturamaKing @DJSnM @planet4589 @OSIRISREx yup. Only needed one. Booster Control authority can handle it
@dslsynth @OSIRISREx Typically spend every last usable drop to optimize orbit  then vent the little that won't feed into the engine
@aWildLupiDragon @ulalaunch thanks
@dslsynth Will do
@FuturamaKing @DJSnM @planet4589 @OSIRISREx Only needed one. It is asymmetric. Booster has enough control authority to cope
@HolsMichael @ulalaunch All things are possible in space
@dslsynth Coll idea.  @ulalaunch   please see what we can do
@wardniner @ulalaunch thanks
@DSLauretta thanks.  You and @OSIRISREx are official part of the family #ToBennuAndBack
@Crow_T_Robot @DJSnM @ulalaunch we are very active
@DJSnM @ulalaunch cool
@prezcannady Lrg constlns will sometimes build a spare S/C. Sometimes placed in orbit. Most are 1 of a kind  so spare parts during mfg only
@SenShelby @ulalaunch Thanks
@Crow_T_Robot good
@ScottishRobot Ask @ulalaunch
@KasperVld Approaching 400 flights.  Butterflies every time
@dslsynth @OSIRISREx Orbits the sun
@tylerjackoliver @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Real time flight profile updates to account for the rotation of the earth relative to the target
@PCDPhotography @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx thanks
@baserunner0723 Tower is designed and positioned to be safe during launch
@LEOMarohl @ulalaunch thanks
@Luke_Macchione @ulalaunch That was more about automatic inflight retargeting that allowed Centaur to compensate
@Luke_Macchione @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Standard capability which is especially useful for rendezvous missions (ISS Cargo  Asteroids  etc)
@Astro_Zach will do
@Astro_Zach yup
@HolsMichael @ulalaunch thanks
@cartee21 @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx thanks
@jeffreypmyers @ulalaunch thanks
@Cosmic_Carol @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx thanks
@dslsynth yup
@Cardoso yes
@KayDesigner thanks
@murphypak @baserunner0723 likewise
@ds_zimmerman @JPMajor @ulalaunch see me on the weekend ;)
@JRascagneres @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx @ej_sa the perfect attire for a trip #ToBennuAndBack
@JRascagneres Right
@JRascagneres yes
@LocutusF @John_Gardi That's why I now save on barber expenses ;)
@John_Gardi @LocutusF For this mission  it will stay in the stowed position.  Don't recall OTTOMH for a crewed mission @ulalaunch
@LocutusF @John_Gardi yes
@RITSPEX @OSIRISREx thanks
@JRascagneres The boosters are interchangeable. One of the ways we seamlessly accommodate late satellites or changing customer priorities
@thePancakeBot @CalPoly Cool
@JPMajor @Mike_Seeley @ulalaunch @NASAKennedy @WeAreGoFL @45thSpaceWing nice
@ponder68 @KayDesigner @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Luck has nothing to do with it.... But I'll take all I can get
Mr. @DSLauretta   Your Uber Driver to Space will be waiting for you at SLC41 ;) https://t.co/oPNxS1ntOp
@KayDesigner @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Yup  this will be 111
@dslsynth Cape
@jasonrdavis @tanyaofmars You know it!
@NzoVito @elonmusk I always do
@kmccoy my ears are burning. On my way now
Alas no. As far as we know  Spike is still performing his duty @NatReconOfc  https://t.co/pthnuOlf3Y
@Kalti @ulalaunch no. Yes. Yes
@Itzalpean @SpaceHedge more or less with a new RAAN solution every 5 min for 2 hours
@chitownchica @ulalaunch @RadarDude We've never hosted a wedding in the VIF before.... ;)
@joebarnard @OSIRISREx Thanks
@ulalaunch Send us an address and we'll send you some engagement swag https://t.co/d7nLnjfcyo
@KayDesigner Mighty Atlas playing Cupid.  This could be a first  :)
@NatReconOfc @DeptofDefense @CIA Happy birthday
@AustinOnSocial @LauraKeeney @ulalaunch Thanks
@Stian_Nuland @ulalaunch Atlas Five.
@RocketmanJRS I've followed you.  Feel free to DM me
@dolostone @OSIRISREx Me too.  Send your address to our corp email and @ulalaunch will send you some goodies for your students
@cebri1 @spacecom @SpaceflightNow thanks
@Astronaut_Ben @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch Pgo = 70% for weather
@SamueleZannoni @DSLauretta Thanks
@dslsynth related to the recent event
@docdailey congrats
@Jack_Frodo @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch definitely
@sparklefingered @621Lynn @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Insanely cool ;)
@docdailey @SpaceflightIns @OSIRISREx Me too
@RuthFieldBeck1 @SpaceflightIns @OSIRISREx Have fun
@DSLauretta @OSIRISREx We are here for you
@snowwrestler @ulalaunch just relieved. If we lost our window  it would be another year before we could go to Bennu
@ChrisDMarshall @rocketrepreneur @pbdes @ulalaunch yup. Worldview and Echostar this year
@realKyleOlbert good question for @Boeing and @NASA_SLS
@Astro_Zach Root cause investigation  robust corrective action  return to flight
.@dslsynth @OSIRISREx So far  so good. Unique ability to optimize and reprogram trajectory up to launch and adjust in flight: Lots of margin
@WinterBynes Thanks.  My heart goes out to the SpaceX team.
@Xavalliger I never joke about this.  Too much heart and soul goes into building a rocket
.@ScottishRobot @OSIRISREx  Our personnel were evacuated from SLC41. All are accounted for and unharmed.  Hope to return later today.
@KayDesigner No
@SPACEdotcom @StarTrek Kirk
@genejm29 thanks
@DougonTech yup
@KasperVld Sorry no.  You've got to work the mission to get one
@NASASpaceflight Thinking about doing a 360 deg virtual factory tour...
@taliaeliana looks like you had quite a summer!
@AllStuffSpace @ulalaunch NASA requires this extra surety for interplanetary missions
@DatKraken @ulalaunch ACES will capture the boil off propellants and recycle them through an IC engine to depressurize the tanks
@DatKraken @dslsynth @ulalaunch The engine downselect for ACES has not yet been made
@sparklefingered me too
@julia_bergeron @ulalaunch Thanks
@collinkrum @TimFernholz @ulalaunch I've been called worse ;)
@polyman71 @John_Gardi @wingod No
@DutraWeather @ulalaunch Drop jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com a line
@SpaceBrendan Shhh...
@AndrewNCassidy I'm pretty sure we would set some kind of record ;)
@Crow_T_Robot Drop my PA a line.  Jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com
@KasperVld Artistic license
@jsalsman @NASASpaceflight Details of how we handle weather are significantly more sophisticated than other providers and proprietary
@cesarparent @johnkrausphotos just part of the flight profile
@AstroAllie5 thanks
@Pandersonpllc @ulalaunch cool
@Sass_tronaut @ulalaunch cool
@stoutde I like the way you think
@RocketmanJRS @Astro_Zach @OSIRISREx Thanks
@alexsturgill @ulalaunch @NASA_go4launch @NASAKennedy Thanks
@stromspace Whatever it takes ;)
@MikeKarnes54 @ulalaunch Send me a pic
@dlandinglegs @ulalaunch @Boeing Thanks
@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch You are here in spirit
@DragonWindow @ExploreSpaceKSC @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @AFSpace Probably because its a DeltaIV
@John_Gardi Time will tell
@KayDesigner My son
@SpaceKSCBlog @ulalaunch @BoeingDefense ULA owns it
@DragonWindow Its a DeltaIV M+4 2
@arattari @Military_Flight @45thSpaceWing @ulalaunch has to do with type and location
@dslsynth On-going event before this.  No  not presently planned
@Astro_Adept @FuturamaKing Going as fast as possible...
.@FuturamaKing Opened with rapid Atlas Launch  then my son hit me with Gov Shutdown Card. Froze me out until he caught up and won. #Xtronaut
@dslsynth You know it. ;)
@dslsynth not yet
@Astro_Adept Live dangerously ;)
@AstronautAbby @Wellesley Looks like a really cool experience
@murphypak @OSIRISREx @NASAKennedy @ulalaunch The Delta Mariner
@Cardoso I like the way you think
@pilliarscreatio LOX transfer line on the right.  Avionics pod on the left
@Astro_Adept @DSLauretta @KayDesigner @OSIRISREx @NASAKennedy @ulalaunch @CapeCanaveralFL Barges are towed...
@Cardoso Right.  Mariner has a crew
@murphypak  @OSIRISREx @NASAKennedy @ulalaunch IDKOTOMH  But I'd guess Mariner is on her way back for the next bird.  Flying 8x before XMAS
@ULALunch @OSIRISREx You know it ;)
@John_Gardi Yes
@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch Always
@John_Gardi @Stian_Nuland @ulalaunch Looks like a Vulcan/Centaur with a single RL10
@SpaceVR @SpaceflightIns @SpaceX Looking good there Gwynne
@Macc21st @Stratocumulus Of course ;)
.@DSLauretta @kickstarter My pleasure
@sparklefingered @KerbalSpaceP I've found that a dash of RP1 in your tea gives it an extra zing ;)
@legoclone09 @KerbalSpaceP cool
@legoclone09 @KerbalSpaceP Not yet
@dslsynth No.  He sniffed around and moved on.
@TheHypaaa @KerbalSpaceP @ulalaunch No spoilers.  Watch this space...
@dslsynth Black bear in my yard 2 weeks ago...
@AiDeeAi Amazon
@crocodilekatie IDK. Got mine as a thank you for contributing to their kickstarter
@CalinWay @matthiascarter @OSIRISREx yes. Compensates for SRB moment
@CalinWay @AndrewNCassidy yup. LOX feed line and avionics pod take up a position
@AndrewNCassidy Just what the mission demands
@Crow_T_Robot Easy Command
@KayDesigner @DSLauretta @OSIRISREx @NASAKennedy @ulalaunch Ship
@shanemuk @NASASpaceflight I do
@NASASpaceflight I like the way you think
@tanyaofmars @westernuCPSX Very  very cool
@teamvelociposse @DSLauretta @NASAKennedy @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch IDK.  What do you have in mind?
@astro_amanda @tanyaofmars Beautiful
@murphypak @NASASpaceflight No
@Astro_Zach Likewise
@stromspace good one
@sparklefingered @NASA the music of launch :)
@lorengrush nothing happened ;)
@Stratocumulus @Pandersonpllc @ulalaunch @SpaceflightIns @SpaceflightNow Nice shot
@dslsynth @VeroMortensen @carlmorner thanks. That hit the spot
@julia_bergeron @The_Jay_Bo Please make it happen @ulalaunch
@dslsynth great idea
@Mausonaut @NASA_SLS @MoonDotStation Nice
@Sherlock_NZ @OSIRISREx Awesome. Welcome
@WinterBynes not yet. Sounds cool
@chip_snyder @NASAWatch 109
@Stratocumulus @SpaceKSCBlog @ulalaunch nice
@WinterBynes looks ok to me
@chip_snyder @NASAWatch We don't talk about NRO Club
@sparklefingered @usa_satcom intersting hobby from a technical aspect but I imagine the sat's conversation skills might be lacking  ;)
@malderi @Astro_Zach @blueorigin I know those guys...
@omcintyre @ulalaunch @NatReconOfc thanks
@OSIRISREx @ulalaunch @NatReconOfc @45thSpaceWing @AFSpace @AF_SMC @usairforce Can't wait
@BP_Hutch @ulalaunch thanks
@KSpaceAcademy @twuelfing @DefenseOne @ToddHarrisonDC Yeeha
@John_Gardi 109
@John_Gardi We wait for NRO to speak first
@NASAWatch We don't talk about NRO Club ;)
@dslsynth @VGChiefTrainer @ulalaunch No
@WeHaveMECO I meant it NEVER gets old
@VGChiefTrainer Soon  but no.  We are approaching the part where we don't talk about NRO Club
@dslsynth Ludicrous Speed
@Cosmic_Carol @ulalaunch Thanks
@SpaceBrendan @ulalaunch Our pleasure.  Be back in a couple weeks...
@julia_bergeron @John_Gardi Good spot
@Astro_Zach yup
.@taliaeliana @VirginAmerica Cool.  Send me a pic if you do
@pilliarscreatio @WeAreGoFL Don't get your laptop wet ;)
@pixelastronaut @ulalaunch Convention is to call the in line boosters stages and the external SRBs Strap on Solids
@dslsynth Pumps
@rappolee Me too
@rappolee Cool
@rappolee Youtube
@dslsynth Starting soon
@Astro_Zach Thanks
@taliaeliana @VirginAmerica Bummer
@crocodilekatie Thanks
@Cosmic_Carol @PaulDalyROI 0830 eastern
@poniosun thanks
@KayDesigner 109
@AndrewMunsell97 @ulalaunch @NatReconOfc Thanks
@Gomerick_Enghor @ulalaunch solids  (The Really big Estes...)
@John_Gardi We don't talk about NRO Club  ;)
@dtarsgeorge @John_Gardi @spacecom @b0yle @SciGuySpace @SpaceKSCBlog @jeff_foust @fcain Ok.  Speed records  EXCLUDING the Flash  ;)
@spodgemonkey @DrPhiltill Yup :)   (but... we also flew Genesis the same day  an Atlas/CST100 model a week earlier at the Cape  and others)
@AllStuffSpace @ulalaunch thanks
@jabe8 yes
@dlandinglegs @FalconGridFin @SpaceX @NASA @ulalaunch @elonmusk Also good  but the acronym is taken  Lockheed Launch Vehicle.  Solids based
@FalconGridFin @SpaceX @NASA @ulalaunch @elonmusk Sounds right to me ;)
@baserunner0723 @SpaceX @elonmusk @ulalaunch @ExploreSpaceKSC That one on the left looks pretty cool  ;)
@dslsynth Advice to love by
@johnkrausphotos @NatGeo Nice pics
@John_Gardi @JeffBezos @trailingjohnson I'm not bald. I'm just aerodynamic ;)
@dslsynth @ulalaunch Fun.  Great bunch of space enthusiasts
Heading over to the Denver Economic Council this morning to talk about @ulalaunch and Spaaaace
@We_Martians Not a lot of research on that.... ;)
@ChrisDMarshall Sure ;)
@KayDesigner Looks like almost too much fun
@ulalaunch Volunteers had a great day with kids at OpenWorld Learning's summer camp.Future rocket scientists  #STEM https://t.co/qBTleT788K
@dslsynth if you mean the hydrocarbon first stage  probably not
@romn8tr Thanks
@MissAerospace @dkeister_ Cheering them on ;)
@DatKraken @ulalaunch If you assume 10% length increases  close enough for now. Centaur remains the same.Have not chosen engine for ACES yet
@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch Thanks
@DatKraken What can we provide @ulalaunch ?
@jabe8 prior to my time at ULA. Mostly small talk. One of the nicest people I've ever met
@Astro_Zach @DalaiLama I've never had my picture taken with Zach
@dslsynth few years ago. He was traveling from meeting with POTUS to San Francisco
@jabe8 longish. DC to SFO
@Pat_DefDaily @DougonTech 2017
@Pat_DefDaily @DougonTech Not yet. Have not finalized pricing
@DougonTech We plan to offer Vulcan/Centaur in 2017 for a first flight in late 2019. Getting inquiries now
@ulalaunch @Qubits_Toy Can I guess?
@Astro_Zach @ChipotleTweets @ulalaunch Happy Birthday  Zach
@Simberg_Space @AaronMehta I am aware.  140 does not allow for detailed explanations...
@DragonWindow @ulalaunch @astrosociety You might be just a little short ;)
@dslsynth @ulalaunch @CopSub PLEASE DO NOT STAND BENEATH DURING LAUNCH.  ;)
@John_Gardi 0830
@dslsynth Thanks
@amzeratul @johnkrausphotos @ulalaunch @USNavy cool
@JoleneGiroux1 @ulalaunch @OrbitalATK thanks
@John_Gardi I'm on this morning at 0830
@Astro_Zach watch the videos on our internal knowledge transfer site. You'll feel like an expert in no time
@Simberg_Space sorry no
@John_Gardi just flew in
@johnjmin Whats the answer @ulalaunch ?
@Astro_Zach @dslsynth imperial
@AntonioParis @Astro_Zach nice pic
@dslsynth @Astro_Zach a lot
@dslsynth @ulalaunch @CopSub perfect flight  but a rough night's sleep
@Astro_Zach @dslsynth that Atlas super heavy would have been a thing to behold...
@dslsynth @ulalaunch @CopSub Cool. I've launch a few from sea. First time  I had to sleep on a torpedo
@dslsynth 5 core...  Sounds cool ;)
@NASA_go4launch cool pic
@Fingersoup IDK.  What's the answer @ulalaunch ?
@collinkrum @thedrive @ulalaunch Thanks.  Been called worse ;)
@JRascagneres @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch ok
@dslsynth @ben_nuttall @github Different compiler or OS issue?
@NinjaEconomics @Robotbeat Intern positions at @ulalaunch are paid
@JRascagneres @ulalaunch Because Blue Origin was already 3 years in.
@fcain @storybywill Because Juliet is the sun (Or astrophysics...;)
@KayDesigner @LastManOnMoon Working on it
@aiaa @PopSci Likely
@murphypak @rappolee @GetSiQSteve @emilylmullin The feeling is mutual ;)
@MatthewPinegar Several Space companies.  Especially the bigger companies use all sorts of skills. And/or think about adding another degree
@nextspaceflight @WinterBynes @ulalaunch I agree.  @ulalaunch please have the swag master send a care package with my compliments
@SP_JohnSullivan @ulalaunch @evankirstel @batchelorshow @SPACEdotcom I like the sound of that ;)
@omcintyre @NASAJuno Beautiful
@fs10inator @ulalaunch Alas  still earth bound  ;)
@HurwitzSam @zlsadesign @ulalaunch Yes
@rappolee @planet4589 It is a moving experience
@MorwicSound @AstronautAbby soon ()
@dslsynth not nearly enough ;)
@marcosantana Give my PA a call. Jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com
Thanks @AstronautAbby #marsgeneration https://t.co/beKRATyhA3
@thomassturm @Astro_Zach @ZeroGravityKyle yup
@KayDesigner they call it a seeder
@KSpaceAcademy @farmingsim @mikeroweworks great idea
@dslsynth super cool  but kind of creepy...
@John_Gardi not yet
@John_Gardi Now you're talking...
@AusAndgie7 @rocketrepreneur @Terubou_Cos bottom row. Second from the left
@tanyaofmars You win ;)
@thefrownyface @ulalaunch likely
@thefrownyface @ulalaunch one of my favorite missions
@thefrownyface what's the answer @ulalaunch ?
@aleroi 2/2 along with certifying that the rocket will be compatible and work in concert with those systems
@aleroi a human rated system adds a crew escape system and different criteria for mission abort. All that gets its own certification
@tanyaofmars I know what you mean... https://t.co/wi7icAXHq9
@FalconGridFin @ulalaunch yes
@stromspace ;)
@FalconGridFin @ulalaunch yes
@FalconGridFin @ulalaunch yes
@dslsynth @nextspaceflight @ulalaunch cuts out quickly so we can devote our bandwidth to the active stage
@AidanShaffer @NASASpaceflight @george_sowers for parts
@AidanShaffer @NASASpaceflight @george_sowers Yes  but for this type of mission its generally placed in the designated disposal orbit
@WeAreGoFL @Astro_Zach @ulalaunch thanks
@romn8tr @cmcichon yup
@chemistrybiker cool
@tehWKD @ulalaunch Good question for @LockheedMartin
@JRascagneres custom GTO to extend sat life
Solution number 2. #howfastula. @ulalaunch  https://t.co/nDjNZk0IGL
@JRascagneres Enhanced GTO. We like going direct inject GSO  but MUOS is a big boy at 7.5 tons
@atubbs @Astro_Zach @ulalaunch thanks
First solution in. Mark with #howfastula. @ulalaunch  https://t.co/L72OT4NZ8f
@spacepat_o How big is space
@DanSpace77 @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @AerojetRdyne @LockheedMartin @USNavy Any time
@littlebird321 @DanSpace77 nice pic
@LauraForczyk @ulalaunch thanks.
@eleventeen @SpaceKSCBlog @ulalaunch how can you not be watching the live feed?  ;)
@nite97m we'll take a look @ulalaunch
@VAXHeadroom @ulalaunch Oh yea!
@romn8tr great physics problem. Rd180 at 860klbf + 5 srbs at 380klbf ea.  Rest to 206 ft. Swag to the best answer
.@baserunner0723 knowledge  passion and poise
@HolsMichael @ulalaunch I won't tell. ;)
@DutraWeather @ulalaunch All good. 80% go for weather
@FrancescoNicoli good guess  but no. It was space enthusiast Prince Edward
@Astro_Zach Canada
@SP_JohnSullivan @SpaceflightNow @robertbrand @ulalaunch My sentiment exactly
@Astro_Zach yes  Earl of Wessex
@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch We could name it something other than ACES.  What do you think?
@Astro_Zach Next time
@Astro_Zach Wow
@FrancescoNicoli Great guess  but no
@jaredhead absolutely
@richardadenot @NASASpaceflight Thrust vectoring
@romn8tr @rocketrepreneur @NASASpaceflight @HolsMichael Very funny. Thanks for the chuckle
@NASASpaceflight @HolsMichael hilarious
@WHEbe60165 @Koln @DrPhiltill @NewHorizons2015 of course!
@FrancescoNicoli Cool tech. Still aways off
.@dslsynth Beta run for us. Feedback will be helpful
@Robotbeat me too
@AstroAllie5 Alas  no. Maybe next time
@romn8tr "Rocket Carbs":  kerosene and LOX
@romn8tr @AstroAnarchy You got it. What's on the stereo?
@thind_navdeep @OrbitalATK @NASA the Majestic 3 core DeltaIV-Heavy is about 20% more performance than AtlasV-551.
@romn8tr @SpcPlcyOnline Cool rocket: Mighty Atlas. Cool sat: #MUOS. Puts smart phone capabilities in the hands of our service men and women
@romn8tr @SpcPlcyOnline Always
@Lisaiz2 @ExploreSpaceKSC @ulalaunch @Astronaut_Joey Clearly a future Rocket scientist
@tanyaofmars Had it...
@ExploreSpaceKSC @ulalaunch @Lisaiz2 @Astronaut_Joey me too
@dslsynth @ulalaunch beta version coming
@Astro_Zach We are a very friendly community of rocket scientists
@SpaceflightIns ICPS is a ULA product
@dslsynth nit off the top of my head. What's the answer @ulalaunch ?
@Lisaiz2 @Astronaut_Joey What's the answer @ulalaunch ?
@tlaustin @jeff_foust that shiny done is a thing to behold ;)
@zerosixbravo @Astro_Zach  working it
@lexcalibur100 @BP_Hutch Very Cool
@Crow_T_Robot unfortunately  I will likely be on travel
@John_Gardi LOX/LH2.  Need that high performance Cryo for ACES unique capabilities
@John_Gardi @blueorigin BE3U  an upper stage variant of BE3  is one of the three engines we are evaluating for ACES
.@Astro_Zach @blueorigin There's a long line ;)
@dslsynth yup
@colindoughan @romn8tr @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos Wish I knew
@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch working on stars and stripes  but without any weight....
Me too. The team is working on it @ulalaunch  https://t.co/OWHUtgAbCY
@sms822 ok. I'll bare that in mind @ulalaunch
We'll be pointing them to it on youtube. Great idea @ulalaunch  https://t.co/XADotleI19
@jabe8 @JRascagneres @SpaceX it is  so far
@HolsMichael @ulalaunch Working on a clever way do do that (ice issues)
@dslsynth Cool.  This might call for a Vacuum Bell Channel ;)
.@Astro_Zach @romn8tr @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos kind of unique. A Challenge coin with a hole burned through it by the event  it commemorates
@Astro_Zach @romn8tr @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos first light on a 15kw laser I developed in my old job
.@Astro_Zach you know me so well
@romn8tr @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos I like it. I have a glass conference table that rests on a segment of tank isogrid...
@omcintyre @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos Only one way to find out ;)
@romn8tr @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos Great idea
@Astro_Zach @DiscoverMag We use a couple handy ones NASA has
@zlsadesign @ulalaunch yes
@nujoud @NASA_Orion Where's the Doctor when we need him?  ;)
@TrampolinRocket @The_Jay_Bo @rocketrepreneur vulcan ACES will be about 25% of a D-HVY and do more
@Astro_Zach Never. (On my way back from DC)
@KayDesigner @NASA_Orion i like the image
@dtarsgeorge @Simberg_Space @LameLefty @Robotbeat @rocketrepreneur lagavulin on the rocks. ;)
.@dtarsgeorge @Simberg_Space @LameLefty @Robotbeat @rocketrepreneur Looking at 11 missions in the next 7 months (incl last Saturday's)
@Danovate @ulalaunch aok
@LameLefty @Robotbeat @rocketrepreneur Root cause isolated. Corrective actions underway
@rocketrepreneur @Robotbeat That is correct
@KayDesigner @NASA_Orion cool
@jasonrdavis @exploreplanets excellent judgement
@SP_JohnSullivan @astro_tim @Space_Station @ulalaunch @OrbitalATK @NASA_Wallops yes i do
@rappolee Love Joan Baez :)
@SpaceHolgar @NASA_SLS Congratulations!
@Mausonaut @SpaceHolgar @TheMarsGen @NASA_SLS good luck
@marzipandancer @ulalaunch thanks.
@KerbalFax @ulalaunch cool
@johnkrausphotos thanks. I'll pass that to the team
@zlsadesign @bencredible @orbitalpodcast @ulalaunch cool
@ShuttleAlmanac @ZeroGravityKyle @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @NatReconOfc very cool
@ShuttleAlmanac @ZeroGravityKyle @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @NatReconOfc
@ArTaqs @ulalaunch @AerojetRdyne @KSpaceAcademy @ej_sa aero and trajectory
@ArTaqs @ulalaunch @AerojetRdyne @KSpaceAcademy yes
@HolsMichael @ulalaunch yes
@ponder68 @TONDTGR @jkelly3rd @ulalaunch 107
@FrancescoNicoli yes
@Mike_Seeley @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @WeReportSpace @yourtake nice pic
@DeniseSaiki @ulalaunch @NatReconOfc Thanks  D
@TobiasVdb @Koln @ulalaunch We dont talk about NRO Club
@arsenal3185 @ulalaunch thanks
@beeberunner @ulalaunch yes. We actually stagger the start to make it a little less dramatic
@ZeroGravityKyle @John_Gardi Forgiven
@baserunner0723 @ulalaunch weight. Ie: light payload going to a high orbit will have lots of SRMs and leap off the pad
@John_Gardi you are now my favorite weatherman
@evanbd @wikkit dont know off the top of my head. Maybe @ulalaunch can find out
.@BP_Hutch @AstroAnarchy It is the ultimate "reality show"
@johnkrausphotos Easy there  Cowboy.  Gotta get this payload to orbit...
@baserunner0723 yes.  And the fence is blown over
@aaronraimist Live feed on https://t.co/mZR0Tag7t6
@spacepat_o Improving towards green
@Cardoso Copy that
@KasperVld Roger
@AstroAnarchy @lexcalibur100 @omcintyre @SpaceflightIns @ulalaunch How did you guess?  ;)
@omcintyre @lexcalibur100 @AstroAnarchy @SpaceflightIns @ulalaunch Can't say without violating copyright ;)
@lexcalibur100 @omcintyre @AstroAnarchy @SpaceflightIns @ulalaunch I'm humming to myself right now
@lexcalibur100 @omcintyre @AstroAnarchy @SpaceflightIns @ulalaunch Yes  we do
@dslsynth Cryogenic and caffeinated propellants topped off
@Astro_Zach I'd come on down  if I were you
@John_R_Maun @NASASpaceflight I'm afraid that rocketry is both the most scientifically intensive AND superstitious activity I've encountered
@astronaut_luke @ulalaunch will do
@DanCMos Think positive thoughts
@Astro_Zach Have your running shoes ready
@BackwardsRewind @ulalaunch Less than an hour
@JoleneGiroux1 A little
@astronaut_luke @ulalaunch I prefer out Mission Success rate
@jwarner127 @ulalaunch Less than an hour
@KSpaceAcademy @ulalaunch Absolutely
@TheBlacktom @SpaceflightIns Yes  Greater than zero
@JoleneGiroux1 Better
@marcosantana That's how it came over the net...  Not hopeful  but acknowledging the fickle possibilities presented by the weather gods...
.@Astro_Zach Yes.  But always better to be sitting on the ground wishing you were in the air than the other way around...
@marcosantana Yup.  Small  but not zero
@MrArron4 @ulalaunch No
@KasperVld @spacepat_o @KSpaceAcademy If you could guarantee it...;)
@spacepat_o @KSpaceAcademy @KasperVld Make me an offer ;)
@KasperVld How'd you guess ;)
@KasperVld If only
@dslsynth Always true
@usmc4o66 @ulalaunch @KSpaceAcademy Don't recall off the top of my head  but not insignificant.  That's why we top off until the last moment
@thind_navdeep @Mike_Seeley @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @yourtake The weather is not being very supportive of our schedule...
@ArTaqs @ulalaunch @AerojetRdyne @KSpaceAcademy Less than you might think
@John_Gardi Luck has nothing to do with it ... But I'll take all I can get
@Mike_Seeley @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @yourtake Me too
@MrArron4 We'll take a look @ulalaunch
@John_Gardi Yup
@_spacehorizons @ulalaunch every cloud
@John_Gardi Weather team is forecasting a potential hole in the storms near the window.  Fingers crossed
@CompositesReid @ulalaunch We typically hang in until the end.  Have literally launched before on the last second of a window
@dslsynth I like the way you think
@Fingersoup @ulalaunch Not so good
@johnkrausphotos @ulalaunch Everybody think Clear  sunny skies...
@dslsynth @renpytom We monitor strikes  strike type and cloud type
@dslsynth @Astro_Zach yes
@dslsynth Yes.  Root cause understood.  Corrective actions underway. I expect all missions completing within the year
@DougonTech That was a repost from me.  And  yes  launches always make me tense...
@Astro_Zach Two rules that most often cause a hold are winds and lightning.  So  far lightning is the watch item due to cloud formations
@romn8tr Thanks.  @ulalaunch please alert the Swag Master
@Blkwooly we agree. #zeus @george_sowers
@jabe8 @ULALunch i hope not ;)
@Astro_Zach idk yet
@Astro_Zach about a week
@ULALunch @Astro_Zach welcome back
@Bubbinski @tanyaofmars nice
@w_mccan @Astro_Zach @rocketrepreneur @OSIRISREx every day ;)
@romn8tr what's is called?
@WinterBynes thanks
@VladimirVjel @Astro_Zach @OSIRISREx 40% discount ;)
.@sparklefingered I am continually amazed at the enthusiasm  interest and sophistication of the space enthusiast community
Please see what we can di @ulalaunch  https://t.co/2Gufuo7mIR
@jabe8 pick up anywhere you like... So long as it's Cape Canaveral or Vandenberg
@MarkMic35809922 @jabe8 yup. That's an average... And ignoring planetary escape  which is technically infinite milage ;)
@romn8tr @BigelowSpace Good question for Bob. The full scale versions are Very impressive. Bigger than my first apartment
@ZeroGravityKyle @NASAWatch I'm working in that. My vision is the democratization of space.
@KayDesigner @ULALunch cool idea
@Astro_Zach See you when I get back
@Robotbeat gets looked at periodically. Theoretically possible. G-levels limit what you can launch
@Astro_Zach Mrs Bruno and I also road tripped out to ULA when I came on board  but from the opposite direction.
@ZeroGravityKyle @MythBusters @ebuhulk Think so. I remember the episode
@sparklefingered @RobertTBigelow Deal
@_spacehorizons @ulalaunch @RooseveltHSLA Just made a personal donation on your website.  Keep up the good work
@ChrisDMarshall Theoretically  but I don't anticipate that being an issue
@holliemaea @John_Gardi It takes more than money to do things right...
@John_Gardi Yes it is
@tehWKD We can now confirm the Customer's request
@tehWKD We don't talk about NRO Club...
@beatgr @ulalaunch Good eye
@BonhommeJerome @ben_pri @dslsynth Always
.@Raumfahrer_net @JWidlar @ShuttleAlmanac The heritage is embodied in the people who designed successive birds &amp; handed down their knowledge
@Astro_Zach @NASA_Johnson Very cool
@dslsynth @spacechelle @TheOnion ok with me
@dslsynth component testing. Engine firings in Tx or Stennis
@siberia_fans @ulalaunch nice
@Space_Damien @tanyaofmars @FailedProtostar nice
@claranellist @tanyaofmars @CERN @ATLASexperiment @CERN @ATLASexperiment @ulalaunch Anything named Atlas must be very promising ;)
.@John_Gardi Careful is good
.@LisaStoj Yup.  Just saw that.  Darn.  I'll be watching tomorrow
.@smenor @DanSpace77 Yes.  It defined the American Ethos and captured the essence of our human destiny.
.@ulalaunch @dslsynth 42
@dslsynth No.  We'll downselect to 1 engine.  It will power Vulcan booster. RD180-Atlas retires.  Atlas' Centaur  Avionics  etc. continue on
@NASAWatch @ulalaunch Attracted by your thought provoking journalism?
@DougonTech @spacecom @rocketrepreneur I am embracing reusability
@Robotbeat @spacecom @rocketrepreneur break even at 10 reuses is based on 10 to 30 flights per year  indicative of today's market.
@Robotbeat On an exp  it wouldn't exist at all.  Everything added for reuse  is additional cost that must be paid off via successive reuses.
@rappolee @spacecom @rocketrepreneur Likely*
@rappolee @spacecom @rocketrepreneur lkely
@Robotbeat @spacecom @rocketrepreneur Nope. Fly back adds significant hardware and logistics. Even SMART has a 2 reuse breakeven
@Robotbeat @spacecom @rocketrepreneur factored in
@spacecom @rocketrepreneur Most studies say around 10 reuses for each booster to break even  then savings increasing with each add'l reuse
@Agrutter87Alex @rocketrepreneur @Robotbeat @jabe8 thanks
@Astro_Zach Shhhhh
@Blkwooly @andyweirauthor @BlairBigelow @BigelowSpace That could be done  but then limitted to tiny habitat volumes. BA330 will be luxurious
.@Blkwooly @andyweirauthor @BlairBigelow @BigelowSpace   Their materials are proprietary  but pretty sturdy stuff. Think "kevlar vest++"
@Avron_p @ulalaunch A very interesting idea.  Will take a little while to become practical
@Robotbeat T/W comparisons can be a little tricky.  Ie; which components counted in W.  Which conditions used for T...
@Blkwooly @evankirstel @mariella_moon @engadget Good question for @BigelowSpace @BlairBigelow
@Blkwooly @evankirstel @mariella_moon @engadget Center core structure rigid mounts equipment
@nicosuave9 @ulalaunch Nice.  Been there.  Good luck
.@VGChiefTrainer @george_sowers @NASA_SLS Yes I do.  Water is everywhere.  Its the great discovery of our time
@Blkwooly @evankirstel @mariella_moon @engadget BA330 will be more of an "expandable". Better impact resist  usable walls  gigantic volume
@Astro_Zach great. He is a very interesting guy
@Shankovich @ulalaunch @Agrutter87Alex great idea
Ok. @ulalaunch please ask the Swag Master to make it so https://t.co/sLD5XuakgM
@romn8tr @ulalaunch @thefrownyface Amateur built
@Crow_T_Robot noble work
@enn_ess_eff @ulalaunch I'm blushing
.@Astro_Zach The feeling is mutual
@Astro_Zach Cool guy. Say Hi
@Astro_Zach @ISDC @eonasa She's awesome.  You'll like her.  Say Hi
@twuelfing @DefenseOne @ToddHarrisonDC https://t.co/a9gBgbjrzm
@twuelfing @DefenseOne @ToddHarrisonDC ULA came into existence 10 years ago. This and all prior administrations wanted RD180s
@DrPhiltill And great vibration transmissibility properties
@stromspace I am both
@DougonTech since we fly so often to so many orbits  this will become a low cost frequent ride. Think airline vs charter flight
@Astrofotografen @ZeroGravityKyle Cool. I have a Coronado on a basic german mount. Love it
@DougonTech got one. Adding 24 U carrier to Centaur. My vision is to have that on every flight  doubling world cubesat access by ourselves
@Astrofotografen @ZeroGravityKyle Nice.  What do you have?
@dslsynth  Great NASA papers on this. Short answer: managing beam intensity to safe and manageable levels.  Like terrestrial pwr plants...
@nicosuave9  Cleaning out the "attic" in Pueblo.  @ulalaunch please ask Propulsion if they have anything useful that we could spare
@Astro_Zach Sounds fun
@travlinmo  @RobertTBigelow @ulalaunch Math works once we are able to build these structure in space from materials originating there
@Astro_Zach Welcome
.@NanoRacks @dovesinspace @Space_Station Congratulations
@aleroi the first via the second
@nicosuave9 @ulalaunch Cool
@mlmarshall13 @ZeroGravityKyle Very pretty.  Had these back home on the ranch growing up.  Thanks for the nostalgic moment.
@thatspacegeek @ulalaunch I'm afraid not.  Colorado  California  Alabama  Florida  and Texas
@astrodave2 Will do
@CO_Space_News Good luck
@sparklefingered I'd say about a 1998-WT24. ;)
@AstronautAbby luck
@Mtshaw113 @ulalaunch @_spacehorizons You were a very bright and perceptive 11th grader
@StrathUniMoot @ZeroGravityKyle @SpaceLawMoot @UniLeiden Good luck to all
@compulog @ulalaunch @jeff_foust My long term vision is the #CisLunar1000. Our contribution will be a revolution in space transportation
@dslsynth @SpaceX It will take some number of flights and experience to understand how much refurbishment will be required
@ThierryLegault @NASAWatch Nice
@Astro_Zach Good luck
@sparklefingered @NASA they say we have 300 days of sunshine. Just not lately...
@sparklefingered So he's a handsome devil then?  ;)
@Astro_Zach Me too
@sparklefingered @NASA Snow's all gone. But now we have rain
@ChrisDMarshall @ulalaunch yes
@sparklefingered @WinterBynes @aiaa @LockheedMartin @garynapier not many
@SpaceKSCBlog @CalPoly SLO. Me too  at Lockheed
@DrPhiltill @mirikramer @Gap Tell me about it...;)
@Astro_Zach as lomg as its job related. ;)
@Astro_Zach Heaven awaits...
@joshWAAY31 @KDVR Thanks
@dslsynth @ulalaunch Cool idea.  @ulalaunch What can we do?
@nicosuave9 We'll check @ulalaunch
@KayDesigner @bertrandpiccard @DrPhiltill @TamithaSkov I am honored
@KayDesigner great idea;)
@dslsynth @ulalaunch thanks
@AstronautAbby Great talk.  You inspire me. https://t.co/q6oiYRrwBP
@ajebbatson @ulalaunch Super chilling adds a lot of operational complexity for small benefit.  Atlas is so powerful  we have not needed it
@dslsynth I think that's me
@rebranded @ZeroGravityKyle (The non-explosive version...).  ;)
@dslsynth Ratio. It modifies the flow of RP1 so that fuel and oxidizer stay balanced and finish at the same time
@dslsynth https://t.co/FINR5RZkEc
@dslsynth thanks. Horses are in the barn
@ChristinaFavre @ulalaunch @NASASocial @OSIRISREx @LockheedMartin cool

@Braun23Austin @OSIRISREx Have fun. We are getting OsirisRex's bus ready at the rocket factory...
@Sweetmankind @ZeroGravityKyle  Me too
@rocketrepreneur @TrampolinRocket Next time.  We fly every month
@John_Gardi @TrampolinRocket Next best thing to standing outside at the Cape is sitting in the CO Ops Center with our Rocket Scientists.
@TrampolinRocket Let us know the next time you are in Florida or Colorado
@Astro_Zach And it touches our lives every day...
@Mausonaut @ulalaunch @esa Great question
Well done @AstronautAbby  https://t.co/FhzW7qoskv
@AstronautAbby I'm back
@tcortellesi @TheMarsGen No.  (But we do have an on-line store at https://t.co/mZR0T9YwBy) ;)
@TheMarsGen Warming up for Vulcan-ACES first flight. #TrainLikeAMartian https://t.co/JzyeqbiJhh
@thefrownyface @EmmaJoycen @realscientists No  I'm afraid not
@SpaceKSCBlog I like the way you think
@KristiB67 @SusieMUC @TheMarsGen Its a mystery
@SusieMUC @TheMarsGen She's kind of a chicken
@AidanShaffer @Waypoint2Space @ulalaunch Great idea!
@TheMarsGen Ok. I've got the obstacle course set up. #TrainLikeAMartian https://t.co/ATp4kThxgN
@jabe8 Sorry.  Only US Persons at present.
@mikamckinnon Drop my PA a line jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com
@jabe8 I did at Lockheed Martin...
@621Lynn @TheMarsGen Yes. Small but nice. Outdoor pools don't get much use in Colorado. Bit cold in the winter...
@621Lynn @TheMarsGen . I prefer the treadmill  but I've had a banged up ankle ever since my horse fell on me
@MatthewPinegar thanks
@NASAWatch @ulalaunch @TheMarsGen Only a lap pool. And my lap dog's afraid of the water...
@dslsynth idk. What's the answer @ulalaunch ?
@dslsynth @TheMarsGen @Raspberry_Pi very cool
@LoriMoreno @CordairGallery @jeffcbeer Does it come with the plane and underground hanger? ;)
@AlanStern @DanSpace77 @TIME Well deserved

@albiondumsday A trim 64 lbm.
@hanlonesq @CalPolyCubeSat @NavalAcademy ok
@tehWKD wirking with Tyvac on that right now
@zperrin99 @ulalaunch It was our pleasure
@lexcalibur100 @ulalaunch Central coast
@stromspace That would be an odd thing to discover in my hotel room ;)
@DougonTech @BigelowSpace @ulalaunch @RobertTBigelow We don't discuss private investments
@wikkit @rocketrepreneur yikes!
.@KayDesigner @HofSwitzerland Wow. I wonder how long a snowman would last on the pad next to a Delta Heavy?
@KayDesigner @HofSwitzerland I'm willing to try anything at this point
@dslsynth micro meteorite impact
@dslsynth It has an advanced semi-rigid insulation that also provides MMI protection
@sparklefingered cool
@Robotbeat @prezcannady I see a time when Earthly rockets never go beyond LEO because reused ACES' will be waiting there to finish the lift
@Robotbeat @prezcannady The Cislunar economy will need a lot of Space Trucks...
@Robotbeat @JRascagneres @ulalaunch Don't know yet.  8m  transitions to SLS class.  So  I don't plan to go that big.
.@prezcannady Reusable engines on first stage.  Entirely reusable upper stage.  Once we learn more about reuse  I see this expanding
.@JRascagneres @ulalaunch For any given mission  ACES removes 1 or 2 SRMs. Will also enable  new missions &amp; change the way we go to space.
.@tlaustin @UpportunityU @ulalaunch I'm afraid you've got me there.  But I am more aerodynamic ;)
.@JRascagneres @ulalaunch Much bigger impact with a reusable upper stage  so we'll do ACES first  then FS engine recovery
.@JRascagneres @ulalaunch Actually  going as fast as we can already.  Doing this in about half the historical time.
@ZeroGravityKyle Just under 7000 ft.  Its closer to space...
@tanyaofmars have some sour dough for me
@BP_Hutch @AstroAnarchy @Crow_T_Robot @genejm29 @HighElfArchmage @g_cgarza167 @romn8tr I'm blushing
@romn8tr @ulalaunch cool
@BallAerospace @ulalaunch  it was my pleasure. You guys rock (et)
@Mad_Maelstrom @GregAveryDenBiz @JeffBezos @ulalaunch yup
@rocketrepreneur @ulalaunch next time
@AstroAnarchy @romn8tr @Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch   Me too. Next time
@NASAWatch @BigelowSpace @BlairBigelow we deliver like a capsule. B330 is a spacecraft. Take itself in. Docking/birthing has options
@rappolee @NASAWatch Mighty Atlas Centaur can lift almost anything
@rocketrepreneur @wikkit on track. Doing well
@AstroAnarchy @Crow_T_Robot @PointyEndUp @BP_Hutch thanks
@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch @AstroAnarchy @PointyEndUp @BP_Hutch thanks
@dtarsgeorge @John_Gardi @RobertTBigelow @SpaceflightNow thanks
@AstroAnarchy @BP_Hutch I understand
@KayDesigner thanks
@AscendingNode @NASASpaceflight @CwG_NSF muah  ha  ha...
@NASASpaceflight @AscendingNode What can I say... I'm an expressive guy ;)
.@ErinLowenberg @ulalaunch They love you too
.@AndrewMunsell97 @ulalaunch @Boeing Yes
@DanCMos next time
@AstronautAbby done
@sparklefingered @OrbitalATK thank you
.@TheMarsGen Sounds pretty cool. Hard to say no to @AstronautAbby. Let me see what we can do @ulalaunch
@zen_and_rockets @rocketrepreneur @ulalaunch @BigelowSpace  Monday
@Pat_DefDaily jessica.rye@ulalaunch has my media calendar. Drop her a line
@dslsynth @LaunchComplex i like the way you think
.@LaunchComplex Right.  Good tip
.@dslsynth but just think how fast I could get between venues ;)
@LauraForczyk @mastenspace @blueorigin @SpaceX @ulalaunch @virgingalactic ariane
@AsteroidEnergy Yes it is. @ulalaunch  what's the answer?
@rocketrepreneur @george_sowers @ulalaunch see you there. Asked staff to set aside time and a room on Wed for me to be avail to Social
@Berger_SN @ulalaunch ULA generates its own resources via ongoing contracts
@AidanShaffer @namdog27 not this time
@AstroAnarchy @romn8tr @george_sowers thanks
.@namdog27 Talking to a great set of engineering students about Spaaace. #wyo
@stephmbrown Right.
@rappolee @jeff_foust IDK
@dslsynth don't know yet
@TrampolinRocket congratulations. Cool name
@TrevorMahlmann @yourtake @PurdueAlumni @CanonUSAimaging @CanonUSApro @PurdueEngineers @PurdueKrannert Congratulations
.@KerbalFax @ulalaunch @KerbalSpaceP Cool. Comfort to know you're there ;)
@Sen_Sherwood @andresdavid Me too
@rappolee I have no info beyond my earlier reply
@rappolee @BoeingDefense @JeffBezos ULA does not own SeaLaunch.
@rappolee @BoeingDefense @JeffBezos No
.@jabe8 @blueorigin @JeffBezos Been many times. Yes  Spent time with Jeff. He is a remarkable guy. Earned my respect as a rocket scientist
@sparklefingered @rc55 Send your contact info to jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com  @ulalaunch
@rappolee That is correct
@rappolee @John_Gardi @jeff_foust Not over yet
@John_Gardi @OrbitalATK Not that I am aware
@Astro_Zach @JeffBezos Hmmmmm
.@John_Gardi @jeff_foust Thanks OA4 was less than a year from first conversation to on orbit.
@AstroAnarchy @TONDTGR @romn8tr @CalPoly Likewise
@NASAWatch That is correct.  We worked this out between us as the right thing to do  and brought it to NASA
@chadshores @ulalaunch Drop my PA a line jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch and she will connect you to our Delta team
@dslsynth That is how it works
@Astro_Zach Knowledge and talent @ulalaunch
.@TrampolinRocket Colorado:  Last Easter  This easter ;) https://t.co/igXWjvMMDk
@Crow_T_Robot Give my PA a call jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com
@AidanShaffer @Robotbeat Yes it is.  Just 1000 times harder
.@chitownchica @ulalaunch yes  spacecraft have a time limit once fueled  so they decided to delay a few days just in case
@rappolee @Astro_Zach @george_sowers Had my own patio furniture issues...  ;) https://t.co/kDQhwN2AXM
@Crow_T_Robot @rappolee @lexcalibur100 @ulalaunch When the customer can accommodate  we de-orbit.  Otherwise  it goes to the disposal orbit
@rappolee @Crow_T_Robot @lexcalibur100 @ulalaunch Yes  there are various options for disposal.  De-orbit was chosen for this mission
@SullivansProjs @BraxtonJulie @DeptofDefense @SenShelby We have RD180 because USG asked us to.  Developing replacement as fast as possible
.@Astro_Zach Gotta love CO.  70F on Tues.  blizzard on Wed.  All done and melting Thrs.
.@rappolee @lexcalibur100 @ulalaunch It was planned to de-orbit after the Cygnus was placed  for orbital debris mitigation rqmnts.
@lexcalibur100 @ChrisDMarshall @jeff_foust @ulalaunch Yes.  Shared the facts  but won't speculate on root cause until we are sure.
@lexcalibur100 @TrampolinRocket @SpaceNews_Inc We are fully transparent with USG &amp; will support the IG.
@rappolee @lexcalibur100 @ulalaunch Cygnus de-orbited.  Just a little further down range
@Cardoso Thanks
@skyfire747 Yup
@Simberg_Space @ulalaunch Sometimes we are volume constrained (not mass)
.@geedropsthemic @OrbitalATK Oh yes.  In rocketry  "nominal" is the best word you can hear
@Cardoso For an ISS rendezvous  yes
@Simberg_Space @ulalaunch yes
@Simberg_Space @ulalaunch Yes
@Robotbeat She's a beauty  but I'm afraid I still get butterflies  even as I approach my 400th launch
@ProjectLRNJ @Ascii211 I just put it on
.@Simberg_Space @ulalaunch Right!  Mighty Atlas has the brains and the brawn
.@ulalaunch Gotta love that Right Ascension of the Ascending Node steering algorithm...
@AstroAnarchy @BP_Hutch Back at ya'
@KerbalFax @KSpaceAcademy Yup.  Isp of pancake batter is good  but LOX/RP1 is a bit higher ;)
@KSpaceAcademy might need a little remodeling...
@dslsynth yes
@rappolee @NASAWatch @ulalaunch Not that I'm aware of. FAR focus is making sure the USG gets a fair/good deal
@Astro_Zach you probably wont be. But you can be in the room with us or in the gallery behind us  watching the same screens
@Astro_Zach 2 Cntrs.  1 at pad  controlling Ops.  1 in Denver  supporting with 100 engrs on console  solving issues  &amp; the weather team
@Astro_Zach Pic doesn't show all of it.  About the same
@Astro_Zach "DOSC"
@Astro_Zach Second photo down  on the right
@joshWAAY31 @ulalaunch Will do our best
@joshWAAY31 Yes  you may use this and any other InfoG I have posted @ulalaunch
Mighty Atlas will sit the pad tonight at nearly a million pounds.  Within minutes  90% of that weight will be shed @Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch
@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch   Centaur's high energy cryogenic propellants allow it to operate for 7 hours &amp; 3 burns  far longer than any other
@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch  Centaur's fuel tanks are thinner than a dime  only holding their shape when pressurized
@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch Mighty Atlas carries a double load. This and last year's missions catch the ISS up from the prior lost missions
@John_Gardi there should be
@dslsynth Shhhhhh... ;)
@JRascagneres a handful at first. Eventually dozens or more. 1000 people will need a lot of space trucks
@romn8tr Thanks
@JRascagneres @SpaceX Competition is healthy for customers and the industry
@JohnMcGauley Its mostly about the ConOps at the launch site.  Parallel Ops  short integration spans (&amp; a great Rocket and pad)
@astro_navis @ulalaunch Good luck!
@Astro_Zach That can be arranged
@Astro_Zach Sometimes leadership is about delegation
@Astro_Zach Great question for your interviewer when you get here
@KayDesigner @ulalaunch Yes.  106th launch
@Stian_Nuland @ulalaunch Not a mass issue.  The challenge with tank art is the LOX frosting it over.  We're looking at some clever ideas
@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch Zach  you accomplished this on your own
@ZeroGravityKyle A wise man
@dslsynth @ulalaunch thanks
Yes.  I've asked my PA folks to schedule time for me to be available to meet our friends on Social @ulalaunch  https://t.co/fu2I3rTPdu
@Astro_Zach sorry
@KayDesigner low inclination orbits (near the equator like GEO) take less energy when launched from near the equator
@dslsynth Not yet  feel free to tweet
@ponder68 @HomerHickam @Rand_Simberg Likewise
@KayDesigner The most common trajectory strategy is to rise vertically to spend less time in the dense atmo  then pitch over &amp; gain velocity
@RichardFPenn @thomassturm Absolutely.  Artist anchored it at JFK's speech.  Good have started earlier
Now that's an interesting idea @ulalaunch  https://t.co/UpQ579oemU
.@EllenStofan @AlanStern @NASANewHorizons Congratulations!
@Znapel @ulalaunch Opportunity for synergy with lots of folks. Our role is the Space Transportation that makes these new missions possible
@dslsynth @Astro_Zach Yup *Cygnus
@dslsynth That has a ring to it
@EPerezTrevino @ulalaunch @KSpaceAcademy Gracias
@dslsynth @Astro_Zach Will do
@KSpaceAcademy @KerbalFax Eh  What could go wrong  ;)
.@Astro_Zach I don't see why not :)
@KerbalFax @beatgr @KSpaceAcademy I can take it...
@MV_Paul @LunarLionPSU @SpaceX @virgingalactic @JeffBezos Good old Polaris A1.  A3 was still flying for the UK in the 90s
@MV_Paul @LunarLionPSU @SpaceX @virgingalactic @JeffBezos Goddard would be proud
@marsbeyond Don't recall off the top of my head  but I believe @PlanetaryRsrcs might have interesting info on their website
@prezcannady I am rich in other ways.  Great family  best job in the world  making a difference for humanities' future
@rocketrepreneur @doyleja71 @TrampolinRocket @upperlevelwinds More to do with the autopilot.  We actually "lean in" to shear  then readjust
.@doyleja71 @TrampolinRocket @upperlevelwinds Within Atlas and Delta allowable.  Dynamic trajectory compensates
@SEGPDK @Astro_Zach That's for the RL10 line.  You'll see the RD180 come in below on the Atlas III line
@Crow_T_Robot We'll put one on the ULA website @ulalaunch
@wikkit Artis took the moon program as the reference point.  So  pre-existing missiles used in Mercury and Gemini appear without progenitors
@doyleja71 @TrampolinRocket @upperlevelwinds  Every rocket has unique criteria. That specific condition likely within our allowable.
@dsfpspacefl1ght check our website's archives. If memory serves  Bernard Kutter published a very good paper. @ulalaunch
@dempsas @ulalaunch @tehWKD No worries.  Hit the ULA website and go under "media"
.@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch Congratulations
.@ulalaunch @tehWKD (We rarely say no...)
@Blkwooly ACES will have an ACS system utilizing "waste" propellants
@kycutter2914 @ulalaunch Early 2020s
@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch @CynthiaNafus Your safe. I'm in NY at RPI. Good luck
@Robotbeat @Marslauncher @marsbeyond @spacecom Correct.  Once in LEO  you're half way to anywhere... This will shatter the current paradigm
@AlexDillo1 @ulalaunch @_r_ULA BE4 privately funded.  AR1 receiving an RPS award.  ULA receiving co-investment to incorp US engine into LV
.@ChrisDMarshall No  but that's a great idea.  @ulalaunch
@marsbeyond @Marslauncher @Robotbeat @spacecom  we will develop the fully reusable ACES upperstage and SMART ...after we replace RD180
@JPMajor @NAICobservatory @JohnBSheldon @gmanewsonline Ha  looks like we are expanding 😀
@Bens_Lab thanks 😀
@NuclearAnthro thanks  cheers!
@Ailish96 oh yes 😀
@Ailish96 nope  everything is fine 🙂
@DaveMosher @caleb_scharf Our version 😀 https://t.co/jXLuKGZbv2
@cosmos4u and we want to find more from the Arecibo Observatory. They are now re-observing the first discovered with much higher precision.
@LarryNittler @DrFunkySpoon @StarzanPlanets
@paulsanderson oh  I was wondering who was the source. Thanks for the detail.
@paulsanderson Ha  thanks. 😀
@b0yle @NewHorizons2015 @NASANewHorizons Will update soon https://t.co/OpVrZgNqsR
@SCStreet yes  and they will cite that paper in their proposal to observe or construct such instruments.
@SCStreet yes  especially if that experimental setup might produce significant results.

@RichardFPenn @GabrielBFonseca initial water inventory plus delivery is part of a complex early history of any planet.
@RichardFPenn Ha! 😀
@ScottWx_TWN @JPMajor @AstroKatie that critic was using the same interpretation of the public to reach conclusions 😊
@ScottWx_TWN @JPMajor @AstroKatie nobody will complain about a Jupiter Similarity Index  or calling a planet Jupiter-like 😀
@ScottWx_TWN @JPMajor @AstroKatie same happens with the "habitable zone"  like if the public misinterpret the term then the science is wrong
@ScottWx_TWN @MiradaCientific @PlanetaryHabLab ESI = 0.87 details here https://t.co/fKMCoTtl1U
@Richardhurst19 nebulas are too cold and diluted  a fluid  water or any other liquid  is necessary to concentrate and promote reactions.

"The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact with other life. … we have been offered contact.” -@WilliamShatner @StarTrek
@HughO2 @suthers @nadiamdrake @AllPlanets ADS titles have from Mercury-like to Pluto-like  except Uranus-like for some unknown reason. 😃
@nadiamdrake @AllPlanets On ADS there are over x10 ‘Earth-like’ title references than from all other planets combined. None 'Uranus-like’ 😃
@nadiamdrake @AllPlanets ‘Jupiter-like’  ‘Neptune-like’ or ‘Venus-like’ seems fine with everybody  but not ‘Earth-like’ 😜 #preconceptions
@ArtOfAstronomy it’s too irregular and sometimes chaotic to be easily explained by any known individual or combined mechanisms.
@tcortellesi boundaries are based on too little or too much atmosphere. Outside HZ not possible to have liquid water  inside the HZ maybe.
@tcortellesi you can ask directly the authors for the papers. Their emails are usually in the abstract page. 😃
@GabrielBFonseca @nyrath That’s considered in the definition of the habitable zone  the borders are based on very optimistic assumptions.
@PeterDEdmonds @MichaelDWall @JPMajor New revised parameters on K2-72 coming soon https://t.co/niGLtFDmr8
Latest @NASAKepler K2 results for the K2-72 planets are interesting but we have to way for additional results. https://t.co/niGLtFDmr8
We finished the analysis of the new @NASAKepler K2 data. We are now in the review process. Very interesting!
The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog will be updated tomorrow with new @NASAKepler K2 planets https://t.co/niGLtFDmr8 https://t.co/wlyaC1FPAn
@Leaving_Orbit pictures when ready 😃
@fedkukso indeed 😃
@zaksheskyman maybe @InvaderXan knows  he is the author of the post.

@SheriB1968 Actually  I'll be in San Francisco for an event on 9/30. Stay tuned
@Scirens @brainpicker @TheMoth Shucks! Love it.
@quadraticadder @PBS as far as we can tell  yes. and according to theory  yes.
If tachyons can't interact with us  we cannot manipulate them to study the universe @supa67 @quadraticadder
Yes! @quadraticadder @supa67
There are problems with tachyons. Most damning  they're probably not real. If they r real  they can't interact w/ us @supa67 @quadraticadder
.@ThusSpokeJon @quadraticadder @supa67 yes actually
They can never slow to light's speed. In a sense  they perceive time to be in the direction of their motion. @quadraticadder @supa67
Hypothetically  tachyons would travel faster than light and have less than no mass  which is to say negative mass @quadraticadder @supa67
.@SkyLeach @ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson The Higgs field may decay one day  but we hope not. We'd all sort of disintegrate I guess
@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson What we mean here is that a light pulse from a great enough distance will never cover enough ground
.@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson Similarly  there can be a static background electric field  even when there are no particles.
.@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson The Higgs field is different from particles. The background field stayed. The particles decayed.
.@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson At some point  the universe expands faster than light can race. light traveling to us still recedes
.@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson That's there are none lying around to hold in your hand. And why the LHC didn't collect any
.@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson The Higgs interacts with so many other particles  that it very quickly decays into lighter debris
@BenMakesTV oooh that's bad
Huh  @CNN covers science? That's good news https://t.co/PLGxBDOjW6
Hanging with my pal @iraflatow from @scifri   can't shake the feeling that the radio is on
.@hackenslash1 @katebevan @grahamfarmelo @marcuschown @NeilShubin @seanmcarroll @JamesGleick @ProfBrianCox honored by the great company
@mhultstrom @AstroKPJ @neiltyson @sandygrains It counts IMHO
.@nemmen @AstroKPJ @neiltyson @sandygrains Yes  but @LIGO cannot detect supermassive BH's. The notes are way too low.
.@croftandi @levelback A rocket trying to escape a black hole is firing engines and not in free fall. Free fall is weightlessness  no forces
.@croftandi @levelback It's hard to form enough black holes to explain dark matter. If they started as stars they'd start as ordinary matter
.@DavidHesperos @martronaut Yes  quantum entanglement seems to involve communication of quantum information faster than c. Amazing
@GenerationSpace Excellent! She's a dear friend
.@DavidHesperos neutrinos have no electric charge so don't feel E&amp;M  but they have weak charge  which is why they feel the weak force.
.@DavidHesperos @martronaut yes it is hard. That's why we can only put upper limits on the mass. We know it's smaller than some value
.@Sabrosit0 The light is very specific to that type of SN. If you know the specs of a store bought bulb u can tell if it's far or close.
.@DavidHesperos @martronaut yes
@DavidHesperos @ScienceChannel Thank you!
.@DavidHesperos Every particle is defined by its interactions  which means its charges. A neutrino is a particle with certain charges
.@TheGistOf @DavidHesperos @martronaut All massless particles will travel at the cosmic speed limit. If light is massless  then it does too
.@DavidHesperos @martronaut In other words  they are highly relativistic
.@DavidHesperos @martronaut Neutrinos with a tiny bit of mass can travel near c but not at c. Massless neutrinos can travel at c
.@DavidHesperos @martronaut There are experiments that measure the mass differences between neutrino species. So some of them have mass.

Rumor has it  PBS @NewsHour will air my interview on #BlackHoleBlues tonight  if you happen to be near your tv's.
.@ScienceNelson @BBCRadio4 We should do that again! Fun.
.@hackenslash1 @JamesGleick Ha! Yes.
.@MeirSimchah probably you're right  marketplace
@BenMakesTV thank you!
.@geekdom7 @nattyover @QuantaMagazine @GregBoustead Shucks. Honestly they didn't use the really saucy pictures.
.@hackenslash1 @seanmcarroll @JenLucPiquant This would have been during my sabbatical at @Caltech when I started writing #BlackHoleBlues
.@hackenslash1 @JamesGleick @StarTalkRadio yes agreed but if I included all the caveats it wouldn't have sounded as good
@Iangfyfe @JamesGleick @SamHarrisOrg @futurism might be kind of exciting
@geekdom7 ha! pretty funny
2/2 .@DaveJohnson776 And the sun is  as you say  formed from debris synthesized in a previous star and cast out in a supernovae

Turns out it's much easier to hit retweet than type. Thanks @scifri for that tweet fest.
.@kirktaylor @scifri sweet. Yes  I'll announce events here as they come up. Dates span April and June with some down time in between. Cheers
.@kirktaylor @scifri Shucks!
@RogerHighfield Roger! So good to hear from you. Till soon I hope.
.@gravitate_to_me @amazon I just bought a pen with metallic gold ink to match the cover! I'll request you sign our paper. See you soon.
. @BrunoTheGreat32  oh no  but I'll sign again tomorrow at noon. Same place
. @BrunoTheGreat32 @SVComicCon I'm at booth 921 now! If you miss me  I'll be back at the booth to sign at noon. Hope to see you
@Ivan_dssd @novapbs @secretlifer hrmm. No
@CrossTalk1818 @novapbs @secretlifer Ha. That's hysterical
Could some of these be black hole batteries? @gravitate_to_me  https://t.co/O9JCyQ4rPg
.@TylerAnderson1 @heather_berlin playing devil's advocate  maybe we observe free will. And have to face the burden of explanation
.@TylerAnderson1 @heather_berlin I'm gong to choose to drink this water right now. No I'm not. Yes I am.
.@TylerAnderson1 @heather_berlin if you mean we are suggesting people choose to be unmotivated  they could only make such a choice if free
@dmonbeer @Thom_astro ha. just very chic.
Happy to see Laura Condati on @CNN Einstein's gravitational waves do exist https://t.co/SF0TSpjkQy
.@PeterDEdmonds ha  good point. it is a bk of the struggle to climb a mountain and yes  the struggle isn't all pretty. but it is inspiring.
.@PeterDEdmonds well understand the book isn't out yet and that is not an accurate description. It's actually written w/ great affection
.@gravitate_to_me @_jeffguo all that copy editing agro over gender specific pronouns averted
@Kakistocrat @darth @FiveThirtyEight Ha  fun.
@StartsWithABang cool. I'm bad with email but over the hols  I'll find a lazy morning to catch up. Til soon  J
.@malster2015 @CNN Yes recycling plants sound like a holy grail  but their issues with waste are as yet unresolved I think. Remains an idea.
Will environmental activists embrace nuclear energy? Or will nukes never be clean and safe? #PWSciCon @CNN https://t.co/bKcf8dZgGC
@selennatalay @MariaSpiropulu @debbiebere @skdh @starstryder I love that.
A one-way ticket to Mars  apply now @CNN https://t.co/82bH10auiU
.@ThusSpokeJon Right  ha  I thought it would be funny to do a blind book naming challenge. If that doesn't go well  then we'll get thematic.
.@RobertGaristo Then again  I have seen people look for mild violations of EP in cosmology  but only mild.
.@RobertGaristo Ah interesting  well I suppose it might fail but the campaign to find a UV complete theory of GR often keeps some EP in tact
@Loose_Lab_Rat @UMich Love it. Thanks for letting me know.
.@RobertGaristo Either the equivalence principle fails at the horizon (it should not) or there's a blazing firewall at the shadow. Or?
.@RobertGaristo Most proponents of quantum gravity would say yes  which is why the recent firewall debate was so provocative.
@EricShapiro @UMich So glad to hear.
.@Chocololololo @perverte_me yes  we are recording. stay tuned.
.@perverte_me @SamHarrisOrg we are building up to free streaming. It turns out that requires technology. But we're on it.
.@reneehlozek @sarahkendrew absolutely. An excuse will be found!
.@sarahkendrew @reneehlozek wait  the gin is virtual?
.@reneehlozek @KarenLMasters shucks Renee  that's the sweetest.
.@WorkerAnt4U @astronomeradam @lukedones @hannorein a theoretical astronomer and a theoretical businessman
.@hannorein @WorkerAnt4U @lukedones love it
.@astronomeradam @lukedones @WorkerAnt4U @hannorein I'll be checking that out too
.@lukedones @WorkerAnt4U @hannorein Nice link!
For those sad to miss Steven Weinberg last week  a video from his event at the World Science Festival http://t.co/ugbdEWF1VE @WorldSciFest
Looking forward from this moment to that one in the near future when this will be the past. http://t.co/4wWveLnSK3 @WorldSciFest
.@GalenQuick @StarTalkRadio Cool  glad you liked. Stayed up late on Mon night to video in for new episode. To air in Fall @NatGeoChannel
@PeterDEdmonds Many thanks. Was much fun.
@eskimo_irl @NatGeoChannel shucks! love it.
.@eskimo_irl @NatGeoChannel  Shucks. Love it!
.@pasmith @BarnardMedia @NatGeoChannel Thank you!
.@BarnardMedia @NatGeoChannel I forgot. I'm on TV tonight. Neil de Grasse Tyson's Star Talk Live. I wonder if I get that channel...
@debbiebere @gkygirlengineer @jumplive @skdh @sc_k For emphasis: Any genuine expertise is valuable.
@debbiebere @gkygirlengineer @jumplive @skdh @sc_k Oh of course! I meant that I've been asked to speak outside my expertise.
.@gkygirlengineer @jumplive @debbiebere @skdh @sc_k Personally I agree. I want to hear from the geologists on this. From physicists on Higgs
.@gkygirlengineer @jumplive @debbiebere @skdh @sc_k Shame that some (not all) TV peeps want scientists to be  quote  "An Everyman". I am not
Higgs: check. Now for the Dark Matter  http://t.co/3AH9i2bnEh via @physorg_com
.@saikanomie @pickover make a little black hole waste receptacle. you'll never see that junk again.
.@RobertGaristo @overbye Physics. The only place beauty really leads to the truth.
.@overbye @RobertGaristo dare I say good legs?
.@RobertGaristo @overbye true that. We'll see how it plays out
@RobertGaristo @WIRED Ah.
.@RobertGaristo @WIRED rather  the inverse of square root 2. Cursed autocorrext
.@RobertGaristo @WIRED Times Square-root of 2 for normalization
.@Wolfflak for the irony...
Yep "Making a Baby With Three Parents http://t.co/2v4lJARDUl via @WorldSciFest "
Love this stuff. "Astronomers use vanishing neutron star to measure space-time warp" http://t.co/frjPF1rCKe via @physorg_com
Notice my dress has stars. Had to step up to the challenge of Neil's thematic ties. @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson @NatGeoChannel
@sciencequiche @DaveMosher @AMNH @StarTalkRadio @NatGeoChannel @EugeneMirman yes
I'm a college professor. Aren't sugar mamas like splashing around in greenbacks? @RPC_Van @JohnRSports @SLSingh
Thanks. Glad to know people tuned in @JohnRSports @SLSingh
@novacop923 @scifri @SLSingh @ImitationGame @nytimes and he deserved the accolade. But for the idea more than the actual machine
@scifri @SLSingh Well the "Bombe" was sort of opposite to a Universal Turing Machine. But the idea of mechanizing a computation was in play.
More on Turing today. Science Friday with me and my ole friend Simon Singh. Tune in a bit after 3pm @scifri @SLSingh @ImitationGame
@PrincessSuperno @gravitate_to_me ha! Shucks. Love it.
@gravitate_to_me @Caltech I am yes. Just grabbing a tea first!
@yildirimustun @stevenstrogatz @WorldSciFest Turing showed there are an infinite number of unprovable facts among numbers The Uncomputables
@yildirimustun @stevenstrogatz @WorldSciFest Godel was first. He showed that a specific mathematical relationship was unprovable.
And here's the MOMI event: "How Alan Turing Proved There’s No ‘Theory Of Everything’ For Math" http://t.co/9oxJjMlYEM via @WorldSciFest
Agreed “@VinCortina @JannaLevin @NewsHour As long as it doesn't involve Ann Hathaway telling us that the fifth dimension is love  I'm good.”
photo snapped by Mark Jackson as I remember? @physicsjackson
@jegpeek Ha! Well there are so many articles out about #Interstellar and the physics of black holes. No storytelling spoilers.
@reneehlozek @Radiolab Shucks  thanks. So sweet. Isn't that the best when you get to junk out on Radiolab.
"A gas cloud collides with the black hole at the center of our galaxy  and we get to watch" http://t.co/27lXcdpkVd via @NewsHour
Ran out of space again: @RobertGaristo So LIGO's arms combined are the big nothings.
Ran out of Space: @RobertGaristo The LHC cryomagnets however require a much larger vacuum  a hole almost as big as two LIGO arms.
@RobertGaristo The LHC beam is thin so even at 27km long the volume is small compared to that of the 4km LIGO arms.
@RobertGaristo Nice question. Let me consider while I fly North.
@ScienceChannel In my case the irrational behavior starts when it drops below 60 F
@WorldSciFest @TheMoth Thanks for the shoutout
@reneehlozek Thanks for the shout out. Great to have you there.
@jumplive @AmyMainzer @MariaSpiropulu Ah  wish that I could! Heartache. I'm back in Gotham.
@AnnFinkbeiner @peterdedmonds @FrankWilczek No  no  not at all. Go for it.
@AnnFinkbeiner @peterdedmonds @FrankWilczek I am writing a bit about black holes now. My way into these stories has to feel first hand.
@peterdedmonds @FrankWilczek @AnnFinkbeiner Frank reminded me that some of the story is in Kip Thorne's book. Curious to know primary source
@novapbs @BBCFuture I know it's very naughty but I've actually been trying to do this at home.
@therealdjflux Cool.
@steveweinstein @davidabatchelor I agree  though  I'll be surprised if any of these are new.
@steveweinstein @davidabatchelor Hmm  think that's 95% likely but in theory could have swapped out a disk. "was ever on it' doesn't follow
@StrangerNoise @SwiftOnSecurity yeah  sorry to burst your bubble about that... :-)
@cosmos4u @HildegardWerth If I understand correctly: para oscillations  confusing altimeter software
@hooglemeister A few hundred km/hr
@NatureAstronomy He's saying it's 100My and not later  so I think it's just an argument about what 'late' is
@NatureAstronomy hmm seems like he is... so LHB not as late as we thought? Will try and ask him afterwards
@NatureAstronomy LHB is different - happens as well I think
@PeterDEdmonds @AstroKatie @NASA You say that like it's surprising in some way....
@spaceleclerc @csa_asc  you mean  they had actual content!
@cirquelar @jeff_foust @barbylon That's fair. I've frequently argued with editors over house style and NASA guide does help that argument
@cirquelar @jeff_foust @barbylon It's style  but style I happen to strongly agree with...
@jeff_foust @cirquelar @barbylon and a quick glance shows their rules only appropriate for US publications  grossly wrong for e.g. UK ones
@jeff_foust @cirquelar @barbylon If writing for a NASA pub  I'll follow their style. I don't consider them an authority of style otherwise
@cosmos4u @RussianSpaceWeb I think @NASA uses the right names internally  it's just PAO's misguided attempts to dumb things down for public?
@ShuttleAlmanac What are you complaining about? That capture came at a time when video downlink was unavailable? Not the priority...
@elakdawalla @ESA_EDM @MarsRovers If only Oppy had started heading west the day it landed  it'd be almost there now!
@UCSSatDB @GWR 13 record with 1993 Mar 14 TM-21 launch  again 93 Feb 11  09 Mar 26  09 Jul 15  09 Aug 29  and 2010 Apr 5.
@cosmos4u    :-)
@romn8tr @esascience @NASA @ESA_EDM The white dot at bottom is likely the parachute. The black smear is the impact scar of the lander.
@GWR @UCSSatDB @Space_Station I confirm 13 is the record and has been reached on multiple occasions
@cosmos4u @Leaving_Orbit I only saw the 'decoding underway' release  is that what you are talking about?
@Itzalpean Yes relative timeline also confused. Ideally like to see SCET-UTC to nearest sec for all events starting at entry  planned/actual
@esaoperations @esa_edm Sounds like you do know the UTC (or TT) at which LOS occurred  at least to the nearest second - maybe release this?
@go_for_launch @ESA_TGO True  I was speaking loosely. 74 deg for Earth sats is often described as polar. It's above the Arctic circle!
@cgbassa @RussianSpaceWeb That would mean TGO was also on wrong traj prior to deflection burn  would have been spotted?
@cgbassa @RussianSpaceWeb I think it's really unlikely the entry trajectory was off.
@markmccaughrean @AndreaAccomazzo   Just make sure you get some sleep as well...
@markmccaughrean @AndreaAccomazzo Mark  Andrea:  thoughts are with you. Looks like it's a tough situation but you have lots of good data.
@AuerSusan It says LOS was 50s before  not backshell sep. They've said thruster firing data occurred after backshell sep and before LOS
@go_for_launch and to be clear  I really hope I'm wrong and you get a signal in the coming days. Best wishes to all of you working hard
@go_for_launch oh  COMPLETELY AGREE. But perhaps there's a difference between what ESA should do (due diligence) and false hope for public
@omcintyre Clear from what they've said that it was not at the correct velocity for its altitude  and a correct-speed touchdown didn't occur
@Mad_Science_Guy @Summer_Ash That would explain a lot.
@RichardFPenn although in this particular case  I do accept the lander was a 90% success. Looks like they have data on all the subsystems
@RichardFPenn Yes. Strong tendency to euphemism.
@Cosmic_Carol @ESA_TGO @ESA_ExoMars And 40 percent more massive (in dry mass) than MRO  I hadn't realized that - impressive
@Skyrocket71 @ArmsControlWonk No  this is a different site well to the north
@elakdawalla Do you have up-to-date lat/lon for targeted @ESA_EDM landing site? I have 1.9S 6.1W but suspect you have a more precise value
@DexBarton no  we're watching Apocalypse Now I think
@DexBarton Maybe follow up with Dr Strangelove?
@cosmos4u OK  it's because I apparently don't know how many minutes there are in a day. Stand by for corrected tweet
@cosmos4u @NASAJPL @ESA_TGO OK  so I probably crunched the Horizons data wrong
@cosmos4u @ESA_TGO @NASAJPL I'm confused by the 4d period. Possible that's as planned and Horizons data is out of date or I've miscalculated
@mikamckinnon This is a big problem. We're hoping to keep @chandraxray working for long time to come because successor not yet funded
@SpaceKate Only a couple more years till ubiquitous broadband on planes even in cattle class  I think.
@rk70534 Yeah  in retrospect that was harshness for the sake of snark. I apologize.
@Simberg_Space @CatherineQ It's the residual Brit in me
@AuerSusan I appreciate the 140 char issue.  Doppler shift shift? :-)
@AuerSusan @Fischblog @ESA_EDM Strictly speaking  a discontinuous change in the Doppler shift
@carolynporco @UCBerkeley Parking permit? They should require the actual Nobel diploma be pasted to the car windscreen
@astrotweeps Very easy to go from 21K mph to zero when on that trajectory. Tricky feat is to still be intact afterwards.
@mirikramer Too soon.
@Litsas @CwG_NSF Way too early to conclude that
@CwG_NSF yes but did 'as expected' include the correct modelled velocity after parachute slowing  as opposed to just correct time?
@upulie Percy Lowell  OTOH...
@upulie I think Schiaparelli gets a bad rap correctly identified some regions;and I think even a few of his "channels" are real (Val Marin?)
@jqmcd only if your home is Moskva
Castor 30XL stage has separated from the payload  the Cygnus OA-5 cargo ship! Congrats @OrbitalATK
@Summer_Ash @aussiastronomer @OrbitalATK  Range safety officer is a woman  judging by the comm
Counting down to launch of the 6th @OrbitalATK Antares rocket  and the first of the Antares 230 model which uses 2 Energomash RD-181 engines
@SpaceKate @OrbitalATK You are GMT+3? It's 2340 GMT so 02:40am your time
@astrolisa Usually it's a 2 day rendezvous  so late Tues?
@joannekarma Taylor Wang  payload specialist on STS51B
@joannekarma I believe @AstroDude is from Milwaukee.  Lucid  I understand  was the child of missionaries
.@_garywhite_ Good point  I'm not counting Anders since Hong Kong was not China at the time  but it's arguable.
The ExoMars @ESA_TGO and @ESA_EDM spacecraft now both 858000 km from Mars and closing. 7½ hours until TGO course change.
The Cygnus OA-5 cargo ship now scheduled for launch aboard the first @OrbitalATK Antares 230 rocket at 2340 UTC Oct 17
Four @spireglobal Lemur-2 sats are aboard the @NanoRacks NRCSD-E deployer on Cygnus OA-5  according to @Skyrocket71
.@megschwamb Yes  a safemode is plausible. There's time to work through recovery before MOI
@Cosmic_Carol @NASASpaceflight @_Spacegeek @esa May need TGO to turn back to face Earth before sending confirmation?
@tehWKD ok  I installed livestreamer and seems to be working using vlc iff I use the 720p_hls option - thanks!  @esa
@RussianSpaceWeb @esaoperations @ESA_EDM @ESA_TGO Last bathroom break before Mars? :-)
@ShuttleAlmanac Jing Haipeng  not Hailing  I believe?
@PenguinGalaxy If we were talking about Memphis or Thebes  an ethnic Egyptian more plausible  but in Alex I think was mostly Greeks
@PenguinGalaxy Yes  but could equally be that they were part of the ethnically Greek pop'n which was most of the Alex upper class
@PenguinGalaxy Hmm really cool if true but seems unlikely. Theon is a Greek name  Alexandria a Greek-founded city. I don't think we know.
@RocketScient1st Gotcha  thaks. 41797 is the only piece so far in the catalog  appears to be from this event.
@RocketScient1st What was the breakup? I see debris from prev announced Sentinel-1A &amp; SOZ breakups cataloged but what did I miss?
@Pillownaut I don't think so... and included afternoon tea at Fortnum's
@Pillownaut England! Shropshire  London  Cambridge  Wiltshire...
@markmccaughrean so  not on a tiny laptop speaker in a noisy airport departure lounge? (I still like it)
@AuerSusan Let's see some hardware.
@RegardSurTerre My agents are settting more fires at Vandy as we speak. Don't tell Tory.
@themarkashley no  remarkably  *actual* vacation. I'm told people have them so I thought I'd give it a try.
@aussiastronomer That is my life goal.
@brianweeden @stromgade Ah yes - I corrected it without thinking. Only for the first few elsets  recent ones are right
@brianweeden @stromgade In the sense that A is the rocket and H is the main payload. I don't mind that  I just hate it when they change'em
@DownHereOnEarth @AstroKatie Was talking to my local sushi chef today about the possibilities for Europan sushi
@DownHereOnEarth @AstroKatie Relevant is the presence on the pressconf panel of https://t.co/2CrfGyjjMU and Bill Sparks from STScI
@DownHereOnEarth @AstroKatie If you were @NASA their twitter stream would generally be a lot more fun!
@thomassturm No - if you look closely TG2 is at 374 and currently ISS is at 405
@NanoRacks Thanks!
@NanoRacks so this is NRCSD-10... or -11  or something?
@cosmos4u @SZ damn they found out about my multiple personality disorder...or maybe I am a  clone set
.@FakeAstropix @guardian indeed  as I did note  Tiangong 1's eventual (2017?) reentry could be anywhere between lat 43N and 43S
@Robotbeat Elon's been consistent in that being his longterm goal  he's been talking 'multiplanetary species' for many years
@FuturamaKing I am working from the press kit and making approximate calculatons based on the incomplete info there
@Pillownaut Nice. Have you read the Sharon Kay Penman novels? Wait  I think we may have had this convo already...
@Pillownaut Warwick the Kingmaker War of the Roses or Danny De Vito War of the Roses?
@Pillownaut guilty
@GlobalEcoGuy @Pillownaut The term 'heliosynchronous' instead of 'sun-synchronous' seems fairly recent  and I'm not used to it yet either
@Pillownaut @GlobalEcoGuy DSCOVR is at L1  which is arguably heliocentric  but a million miles (literally) from heliosync
@Pillownaut @GlobalEcoGuy Here's my plot of SSO: active sats in green  Chinese ASAT crud in black https://t.co/meJvz8NBqS
@Pillownaut I think @GlobalEcoGuy is confusing heliosynchronous (or sun-sync)  which IS polar orbit  with heliocentric - very different
@AscendingNode Well  they are buying it from France  it's not like they have a domestic capability to build one
@SteveShawCA Yes  BX-2 is a small 40cm cube currently stowed in the aft bay of TG-2. It will be ejected later in the mission
@DougonTech  Nope. That's for the 2020 station.
@JayAlver Yeah  the actual Chinese story said they were stopping experiments with it  not that they had lost comms. It was ambiguous
@JayAlver They were reported as saying that  but if you read the original statement I don't think that's what they actually said.
@aiaa @brianweeden Damn  I'm going to get major carpal entering all those into my catalog once the tracking improves
@JayAlver I imagine that is TBD. I would be surprised if it ends up only being one.
The @NanoRacks NRCSD-9 deployments were completed at 0540 UTC Sep 15 with the deployment of the final two Flock-2e'
@NanoRacks probably you mean 18:15:00 CDT?
The @planetlabs Flock 2e'-13 and 14 satellites (Doves 0C45 and 0C56) were deployed from the ISS using @NanoRacks NRCSD-9 at 1525 UTC Sep 14
@NanoRacks @Space_Station @planetlabs @DovesinSpace Congrats! These were delivered on OA-6  correct?
@markmccaughrean @auersusan I'm sure Musk's factory floor is little better  but he's not as famous for it.
@markmccaughrean @auersusan The fact that I one-click all my money to the other guy is why I can't afford an MCT berth!
@AuerSusan Especially one famous for the controversial working conditions of their employees.. (admit he gets most of my disposable income!)
@DSLauretta Great mission!
@rappolee @OSIRISREx @torybruno I would love to have the Centaur post-blowdown OPM
@FuturamaKing @OSIRISREx Sun is much heavier than Earth  so balance points are much closer to Earth than Sun (100x)
The @OSIRISREx probe will pass about 190000 km from Sun-Earth L1 this evening (0319 UTC Sep 12) on its way out of the Earth-Moon system
@ScottWx_TWN @WallaceMarkS @AmericanEclipse Well  it has to be decently bigger than 1LD or the Moon wouldn't stay attached!!
@ScottWx_TWN @AmericanEclipse Nice! Good example
The @OSIRISREx probe is now beyond the orbit of the Moon  heading outbound...
@FuturamaKing @everyEarthquake Only above-ground ones
@lyndalovon Correct. Just an event of the right size in the right location. Not confirmed yet  but seems highly likely.
@lyndalovon @everyEarthquake https://t.co/R5lmnLltil
Congrats to @ulalaunch and @torybruno for giving @OSIRISREx a magnificent sendoff
Spacecraft sep! @OSIRISRex and AV-067 separately on hyperbolic trajectories  will leave Earth space (Hill sphere) Sep 12 about 0200UTC
@joannekarma and also  I don't think there is a bug in the actual trajectory of O-Rex if that's what you meant? :-)
@joannekarma Yes  bug in the graphic. I take no position on the existence of bugs in reality.
The @OSIRISRex space probe is still attached to Centaur; will separate at 0004 UTC
AV-067 and @OSIRISRex orbiting over the Congo prior to the second Centaur burn
@alexwitze Shame on you  one more rocket burn to go
Launch of @OSIRISREx panned for 2305 UTC (anyone know if it is exactly 2305:00 ?)
Planned orbit for @OSIRISREx is 0.77  x 1.17 AU x 0.2 deg; it will return for an Earth flyby on 2017 Sep 22 before setting course for Bennu
@hvdh16 @Skyrocket71 Yes. I didn't make the NEMESIS/PAN connection then because there was (misleading) evidence PAN wasn't an NRO sat
@Robotbeat and of course this is all ignoring the fact that the atmosphere exists
@Robotbeat For this and most flights yes  depends on ISS atitude. For TMA-09M I estimated +20 km  so it varies.
@Robotbeat I estimate about -30 km but there's some slop on that.
@stromgade @Skyrocket71 @CraigCovault Yes I saw this - most interesting
@markmccaughrean on request. Since everyone else seemed to be doing it...
@EXEDEHARRY @AirbusDS and those kits have the EPC suborb parameters and the launcher number  which the @Arianespace ones don't...
@EXEDEHARRY @AirbusDS Yes  that's my point  they STILL haven't put up 232  much less 231...
@EXEDEHARRY @Arianespace I don't suppose you know why @AirbusDS hasn't yet posted its VA232 press kit? https://t.co/Wfvn79ky1B
@lorengrush Possibly unclear to them too... better unclear than clear but later discovered to be incorrect  yes?
@DJSnM @nyrath I'll take the bars I can clear at this point.
@The_Stargazer I am only talking about failures PRIOR to T=0.
@slacka1967 @ZachInFlight Urban legend  well debunked. The cover was pulverized and decelerated in the first few km of altitude
@SafeNotAnOption @Robotbeat @Zusiman Yep  just heard SpaceX quoted on WESH 2 news... nothing on web or twitter from them yet
@jgeorge @lorengrush Not quite how it works. The other wings are not all space  e.g. 44th Missile Wing was the missile silos in S Dakota
@aussiastronomer No  this wasn't a reused one. Regular new one  during countdown to static fire test
@NASASpaceflight I really hope so
@sgcsalmon @BIS_spaceflight I still have my copies of all of these! Well-thumbed...
@upulie Reminds me of the putative Mars-rock fossil fiasco
@upulie oops
@emoontx @mikamckinnon Just checked again  the reveal is in chapter 10 of Sporting Chance
@emoontx @mikamckinnon (Just happened to reread them last week!)
@emoontx @mikamckinnon That was in Sporting Chance  the 2nd of the Heris Serrano tril  though part of the payoff was in next book I think
@FuturamaKing Yep  non-Kep effects can lead to surprising results. Orbital energy  semi-maj axis quite stable; other elements not so much
(Talking of orbital decay: tagging @orbital_decay  I think you will like the above series of tweets)
@ShuttleAlmanac Yes  it was a cover (I think from one of the newly installed antennae?) that came loose on the recent EVA
@Robotbeat @elakdawalla @masequeira1 hard to make omnipotent characters not annoying (as &gt; 2000 years of such stories show)
@Spkr2Managers @NASAJuno I think cloud tops. Might be 10 bar level.
@SteveShawCA Yes  that's the most likely thing. 2nd guess is something came loose in recent Progress orbit raise.
@SteveShawCA Unlikely  that would be suborbital. Looks like it might have come off at least 2 days ago
@StephenClark1 Excellent  thanks a million
@girlandkat @tomkerss Nice  especially the little dig at the MilFalcon..
@NASAWatch I don't think @ExoCharbonneau thinks interstellar travel is crazy  just the current proposals on how to do it...
@pkgw Oops. (Not my department!)
Following them comes @ulalaunch with 7   then @arianespace  @roscosmos  CALT/Beijing and SAST/Shanghai with 6 each
@davidabatchelor Hmm so is (243) Ida a planet? It has a moon  Dactyl https://t.co/XNwLzBdwXr
@Itzalpean Presumably uncertainty in propellant usage due to launch time slips  upper level winds etc?
@88n6shi88 Yes  but that doesn't include the nice details like EPC suborb traj that only @AirbusDS launch kit does (This not my 1st rodeo)
Flight VA232 probably uses Ariane 5 launch vehicle L586  but I haven't been able to confirm this (@Arianespace @AirbusDS ??)
Ariane launch later this afternoon. Still no 'dossier de vol' online at @AirbusDS website  alas
@brianwolven @prgrmr42 yeah  that's another good point
@prgrmr42 No  it (like other single dish telescopes) doesn't have the spatial resolution needed - you'd need JVLA or something similar
@aschwortz Same with Fomalhaut b  and Sirius B. I think those are legit formal names  on equal footing with Alpha PsA b and Alpha CMa B
@JayAlver @ThatNuttyFanboy Not without additional data of some kind
@JayAlver @ThatNuttyFanboy Cute idea  but if you can go that far out of plane  just as easy to go there.
@pkgw And the 100s of helpdesk questions we've got going 'why can't I make regions anymore' explain why that is the case :-)
@Astro_Wright @pkgw  Yes  sorry about that. It changed about a year ago. It's confusing everyone but worse to change it back again!
Here's @cbs_spacenews and @lorengrush on STEREO-B https://t.co/32bCyhNuYF  and https://t.co/AqkvwzSWFY
Can capture history of AGN activity by looking at response of clouds kilo-lightyears from the AGN - @kevinschawinski
So @kevinschawinski notes wide dynamic range of timescales in AGN and their host galaxies makes it hard to connect effects
Back at CfA the weekly Quasar Tea (can you tell there are a lot of ex Brits in the group?) features @kevinschawinski
@NASASpaceflight bummer  ripoff
@Bryson_M You should contact @PeterDEdmonds who I am sure can help you out
@NASASpaceflight Do they have Prime? Does Amazon provide next day delivery to ISS?
@Zerstaubung @genejm29 No  just saying there doesn't seem to be one though capacity is there. Probably nothing suitable to manifest
@AscendingNode @dalcantonJD Yes  fair point. You'd have to split off 20% of the time for small annual projects.
@NASASpaceflight I remember seeing SSME tests when I was working at MSFC in 1991. Always impressive.
#Chandra10 @martinselvis2 rebuts Kazanas saying alternate (Krongold et al) models also fit
@PeterDEdmonds and most of the rest of the community too I think. First really convincing example - based on the Uhuru data IIRC? #Chandra10
#Chandra10 @kevinschawinski advocates for deep survey intermediate in size and depth btw CDFS and COSMOS
#Chandra10 @kevinschawinski Very few galaxies at z=6 can have formed big black holes.
#Chandra10 @kevinschawinski - why haven't we seen the high z massive black holes?  Not seeing X-ray AGN at z&gt;5
@kevinschawinski @vrooje Clearly need to start a business where astronomers crossing the ocean act as cash couriers btwn US and modern world
@NGC3314 @martinselvis2 Exactly IMHO
Paraphrasing @martinselvis2 - decadal competition should be between best balanced programs  not best single missions
#Chandra10 Call from @martinselvis2 to avoid unaffordable 'killer app' missions  fly balanced program of 'Greater Observatories'
@shannonmstirone Just teaching how to follow the route Cas -&gt; And and Peg -&gt; Beta And -&gt; Mu And -&gt; Nu and 32 And -&gt; M31
The @NanoRacks NREP external platform was removed from the Kibo airlock on Aug 5 and installed on the JEM Exposed Facility at location EFU4
@Stephen1424 @themarkashley Delighted to discover new @WesternDigital MyBook I just bought doesn't have VCD crap after all  prob solved
@Stephen1424 @themarkashley "For the most part" means "but not if only have Linux boxes". Annoying to buy a Windows or Mac just for this
@tracy_karin Yeah the trouble is I'm not great at keeping my mouth shut so I'm happier without a security clearance :-)
@tracy_karin That might be overkill but looks interesting. I've been resisting NAS approach till now but I guess I could set up NFS
@tracy_karin Nice. The big plus of the seagates is that they were trivial to set up on my linux system. I have a total of 35Tb.
@tracy_karin Yes  2x backups thank goodness. I haven't tried Synology.
@kevinschawinski I will be at ChandraNextDecade  yes! @PenguinGalaxy
@Stephen1424 @themarkashley No luck mounting. Sigh - I can't stand the extra fake Smartware drive on the WD  but maybe I have to suck it up
@themarkashley OS reports disk serial no then reports sense key h/w error when attempting to spin up. TBH unsure how to crack external case
Thanks all. @cosmos4u I think it's just that my picture was so ugly it broke your browser. You need to adjust its tastefulness settings.
. @cosmos4u Odd. Hey other followers  do you see my avatar ok or is it broken the way it is for Daniel?
@cosmos4u How odd  it works for me
@cosmos4u @AstroKatie I only wrote two of those. And one was a prelaunch prediction!
@SP_JohnSullivan Not an issue of comfort  just accuracy in reporting (and perhaps understanding WTF the NK were thinking)
@datachick Yeah  I would start a ruckus if I had 10 minutes free during business hours to do so...
@datachick Friedrich SL36. Only a year old. Got 3 fans running in my apt but far from adequate.. the heat from my computers doesn't help!
@datachick Finally got new AC board after 4 weeks wait. Didn't solve problem. Need fan motor. Will take another 3 weeks. #ACWatch #melting
@dcastelvecchi there are a few articles like https://t.co/mc1ZKhoP4y but my detailed  info was from informal conversations
@Skyrocket71 Yes  that is my understanding from folks involved.
@themarkashley Units are years. 2016.5 = 2016.50 = halfway through 2016
@aschwortz Congrats Andria!
@Orangetrees2 Think this is probably unrelated since Louisiana is too far south of the trajectory.
@mikamckinnon too bad. We have a set of trusted outsiders not on team we use for this kind of thing - insiders too vulnerable to groupthink
@mikamckinnon so hopefully you have someone you trust doing a 'red-team review' of it...
@GlytchTech @Azcz @NovaSilisko @BadAstronomer Careful with those predicts  last one I saw had a +- 9 hour error bar so location meant zip
The @ulalaunch Atlas V (a 421 model) went up from Cape Canaveral at 1237 UTC with a secret satellite for the National Reconaissance Office
@GlytchTech @NovaSilisko @BadAstronomer Booster from test launch of new Chinese rocket
@Pillownaut @astroengine Me too! Today want to flop in front of TV watching the WW movie for 5th time. They need to hurry and make it.
@markmccaughrean @chandraxray for Pete Conrad who died a couple weeks earlier.
Next up for @chandraxray today is an M dwarf for @pkgw  a magnetar for Vicki Kaspi  and a star forming region for Leisa Townsley.
@thomassturm @Robotbeat @jeff_foust Calibration as well as testing. These things never have the same per-pixel spectral response twice
@Robotbeat @jeff_foust Probably a lot of tracking down subtle leaks  which takes personnel and time  even in a pure copy
@Robotbeat @jeff_foust There is a lot of testing involved in building something that works reliably at subkelvin temps
@themarkashley Sorry  totally lame  I just do it. I will try and be better about posting the fact on twitter
@cosmos4u Nope  all I've seen is the space-track info
Congratulations to @orbital_decay - sorry  I mean Dr. @orbital_decay !
@UCSSatDB Working on my deep space catalog!
@Pillownaut :-(
@taliaeliana @SpaceX They are aware that they live near a spaceport  right?
@ScolesSarah @hubbahubble Thank you -nevertheless I'll always regret that I and others didn't create an env. where y'all knew could tell us
@hubbahubble @ScolesSarah Of course - it shouldn't be on you. My hope in the REU is I spot there's a problem and ask. We all failed you.
@ScolesSarah @hubbahubble Great article. But I feel so bad I didn't spot the stress you were under that summer wish I had been there for you
@shanpalus @RachelFeltman I did notice that the equations on the blackboard made more sense than in most movies!
@Robotbeat @KameronHurley  True but suspect those  'quasisatellites' need m &lt;&lt; M and I doubt a naked-eye one would be stable
.@Robotbeat reading @KameronHurley's MirrorEmpire  skeptical of moon's multiyr period...can't stop self trying to make the astrophysics work
@mikamckinnon For some of us that's the only version of "from" that we have... thanks for passing on the updates
@UCSSatDB Lots of variables - changes in atmospheric density  changes in mission phase  ground station scheduling issues...
@cosmos4u @drspacejunk Certainly 'hurtling' is an exaggeration. It's hurtling around Earth but not towards it.
@AscendingNode Mostly just to park in in hibernation and reduce frequency of reboosts  I think
@aussiastronomer lol I can see why! Jumps are orbit reboost manuevers...
@asrivkin @PlanetDr I guess I can no longer use the excuse that my admin duties get in the way of writing journal papers...
@AscendingNode Aren't Kiwis basically a southern hemisphere version of Canadians? :-)
@cosmos4u @iceinspace Now compiled to detailed writeup at https://t.co/C99v4pCZXB
@kevinschawinski @joezuntz I am disappointed that this is not in fact an offiical W policy - it should be!
@say_cem @RainerKresken @cosmos4u wrong in the sense that the other Helios is even faster
@RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem Oh  apparently someone made SPICE kernels a few years ago https://t.co/nQi568fsvu
@RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem Someone has fit elements to the data - I need to crosscheck with mine: https://t.co/zd78ivO8ao
@planet4589 @RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem There are positional data at e.g. ftp://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/helios/helios2/traj/hour/
@RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem  My source is a file of state vectors from I believe NSSDC circa 1993
@planet4589 @RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem Putting it out there to troll someone into doing a better job.
@RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem I'm afraid so. That's what I mean by 'really dumb'. Won't be good on many-year extrapolation.
@themadhatter355 In any case  it's not Juno.
@themadhatter355 Not clear what initial premise was. If you want 'live probe' record is Helios 1. If you want 'human artifact' it's Helios 2
. @markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASAJuno This seems to be the error: someone just calc'd geo speed of Helios 2 on day of max helio vel
. @markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR @NASAJuno .. you don't get geocen record on same day as heliocen record - or even same probe
.@markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR @NASAJuno H2 does hold helio speed record in Apr76.  But...
. @markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR @NASAJuno Similar graph for Helios 2 https://t.co/qV3nt3R3Ob
@RocketScient1st @markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR One claim - the one I am challenging - is geocentric
@gtwhitesides In the much shorter term  so will Solar Probe Plus
@KeithMansfield @GWR I should really dig out those letters  I suspect they are in some ancient file folder in my back room
@KeithMansfield I think you mean @GWR not @GWRUK. I  contributed to @GWR's space record page when in college  exchanged letters w Norris
. @markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR Here is a version in mph for the metrically impaired https://t.co/i9xZTSjRTF
.@markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR Here is my calculation showing Helios 1 still the fastest robot ever https://t.co/fVU9ODTDO2
. @cosmos4u @say_cem @NASAJuno Orbital elements from an old NASA source  may not be quite right but don't think off enough to matter
. @cosmos4u @say_cem @NASAJuno The lower panel shows the angle between the Helios 1 and Earth velocity vectors
.@cosmos4u @say_cem @NASAJuno You can see that Juno *does* beat the Apr 1976 peak of Helios 1 but the Dec 1980 peak was much higher
.@cosmos4u @say_cem @NASAJuno Here is my calculation showing Helios 1still has the record https://t.co/L9xuFGGR4o
@cosmos4u @NASAJuno Actually for the heliocentric record I believe Helios 2 pips Helios 1 due to its slightly lower perihelion
@markmccaughrean @esascience Wondered if it might be a French translation thing (dernier = latest OR last)
@NASASpaceflight @CwG_NSF I'm betting I make that mistake at least half a dozen times in the next week
@sciam @Hellmanns @ClaraMoskowitz That sandwich is almost bigger than Clara!
@RichardFPenn @cbs_spacenews I guess they aimed it so that Jupiter's gravity slowed it down nearly to capture
@RichardFPenn @cbs_spacenews Not even close  only 0.5 km/s. Earth orbit insertion by upper stages much larger.
@RachelFeltman I think it's just the approach movie we've already seen?
@geoffryken @ulalaunch (and Galileo orbiter). Yes. Closest non-fatal orbit.
@geoffryken @ulalaunch ..err How about the Galileo Probe?
@vrooje @merrdiff @AstroKatie Right  I am using actual times in my tweets  but NASA and most others are doing Earth-received
@JPMajor @burritojustice @sondy @elakdawalla @NASAJuno Sorry - not sure. May try and calculate once things slow down...
@lorengrush @alexwitze @mikamckinnon @mirikramer @RachelFeltman Time to put on a nice dinner while I think of you all out there
@planet4589 @markmccaughrean @NASAJPL Quick analysis using  Horizons ephem suggests max v_rel_geo around 75 km/s at perijove 2
@markmccaughrean Fair enough!
@planet4589 @shannonmstirone But Helios and Earth orbits not in sync  later perihelia the vel vectors line up differently
@shannonmstirone I've confirmed with my calcs that the 165000 appplies to the Mar 1975 first peri when Earth/Helios vel vectors at 90 deg
@markmccaughrean @NASAJPL Ah very good question. Jovicentric peri vel a bit less after JOI and PRM. Will investigate.
@markmccaughrean I think @nasajpl just checked v-rel on first perihelion and didn't calculate later orbits for better alignments.
@markmccaughrean @nasajpl  Trouble is knowing how accurate orbit propagation is after they are no longer tracked but should be good enough
@markmccaughrean @nasajpl Fair issue on Helios 2. Helios 1 was still operating in 1985 so its Dec 1980 record is valid on that criterion
@markmccaughrean @nasajpl Helios 2's max was only 92.7 km/s on 1982 Nov 24. Still faster than Juno  but not as fast as Helios 1
@shannonmstirone On Dec 1980  while still operating  Helios reached 215 000 mph Earth relative. JPL's value only applies to its first orbit
.@markmccaughrean @NASAJPL I have redone my calculations and stand by them. In Dec 1980  Helios 1 had an Earth-rel velocity of 96 km/s
@markmccaughrean Exactly. The JPL claim was geocentric.  Helios was 60 heliocentric at perihelion so 30 to 90  depending on time of year
.@markmccaughrean Apparently JPL disagrees with me. I am redoing my calculations.
@shannonmstirone I believe they are incorrect - will get back to you
@AstroGingerSnap @shannonmstirone me  today https://t.co/3mN49hptI6  ( but at least I am self-aware)
@AstroGingerSnap @shannonmstirone Precisely. I suspect it's exactly that - failure to check the records diligently.
@AstroGingerSnap @shannonmstirone Don't know where it comes from. Helios also solar powered. Suspect they are just wrong.
@shannonmstirone No  57 rel to Jupiter  and much smaller than the 96 of Helios 1
@shannonmstirone I don't accept this claim - this is Juno's geocentric velocity  61 km/s. On 1980 Dec 5  Helios 1 was at 96.2 km/s Earth-rel
@PatchenBarss @mikamckinnon @NASAhistory I guess Grissom's corned beef sandwich is the earliest one I know of...
@PatchenBarss @mikamckinnon 8000  payloads in orbit or beyond to date  they are all interesting :-)
@PatchenBarss @mikamckinnon My estimate is the figurines are &lt; 0.001 percent of Juno's dry mass
@GreeningGalaxy @cosmos4u First time you hear it sure. But as a kid  I got a feel for such things by seeing the numbers in different cases
@GreeningGalaxy @cosmos4u And for an astronomer  potentially confusable with Gigayear.
@cosmos4u I take care not to stand at the focus of the Chandra mirrors  though  so my dose is fairly low.
@cosmos4u ok  so a rad is just a cenitGray? Pretend I said 250 centiGrays.
@cosmos4u Do you know what the dose Juno gets is in Grays?
@cosmos4u Just quoting what was said in the press conference - honestly don't know anything about such things.
@cwmagee @cosmicpinot @DoctorKarl No  would have been well separated by the time of the observation and in the middle of its reentry descent
@jasonrdavis @kchangnyt Ouch. These things happen... I have seen (and almost perpetrated) similar disasters so I feel for Marc here...
@cwmagee @cosmicpinot @DoctorKarl A Progress robot cargo ship left the ISS at 0348 GMT and remained fairly close to it for 3 hours
@ShuttleAlmanac I don't know  I missed it.
@SputnikInt Clearly overmagnified &amp; showing defects of camera lens. Not real structure. Probably star;might be Chinese sat launch that night
@DrMRFrancis @Capoglou Agreed
@Capoglou @DrMRFrancis I don't know. NASA folks have been told not to go  I understand. Very unfortunate.
@DrMRFrancis :-( It gets worse and worse. Not going to be good for the COSPAR meeting in July  on top of all its other bad implications
@rappolee @torybruno Preferably before it is travelling at the second cosmic velocity  I assume
@markmccaughrean @esa_rosetta @aisfranciosi Did you see the library in the Citadel? I want the job as head librarian.
@markmccaughrean @esa_rosetta @AisFranciosi Yes  that is typical role. Ian McShane didn't even get a big plot reveal!
So  Lyanna Stark costarred with Lord Baelish in the wonderful @esa short https://t.co/QkLpudd20s Ambition h/t @markmccaughrean #GoTFinale
@markmccaughrean @ESA_Rosetta I did not spot that Lyanna was Aisling - thank you for pointing that out!
@WoodLloydWood @AstroKatie Clearly you just use the side that was closer to the first point of Aries on epoch B1875.0
@ShuttleAlmanac Yes thanks - been following chinaspaceflight site for a while
The @ULALaunch commentary talking about the waveform a lot without actually saying "it's been a monumental screwup" https://t.co/trAtICF844
@ponder68 @ulalaunch Usual MUOS profile is to high perigee GTO  say 3800 x 35780 km
@torybruno @ulalaunch Too bad the data crawl is cut off at the top of the picture so can't see altitude number...
@astrokatey Yeah  sorry about that.
@rjmlaird Yeah. And Cornwall's only really been part of England since 1300 or so
@rjmlaird The Untied Kingdom.
@AscendingNode I probably kept it in business when I was a kid...
@cosmos4u @elakdawalla @astro_Liz Not the Boston I'm in  - they "voted" to leave in 1776.
@carolynporco The French had London for a while in 1215  maybe it could rejoin them
Yay Lambeth! The home of @BIS_Spaceflight votes to remain
@astrokatey I think that's very likely. Not immediately  but a couple of years down the road.
@PenguinGalaxy sadfly lost my UK right to vote after more than 15 years abroad without a UK residence. :-(
@mirikramer @SarcasticRover The @BIS_spaceflight folks have been attempting that suince the 1930s ;-)
@DougonTech Good question  hey @PlanetLabs  how about having @DovesInSpace tweet an "aargh!" on reentry?
@NanoRacks still no info on the Cygnus external deploys? At least a deployment date/time?
@cosmos4u Yes  I agree  21
@vacant3rdman Orbital lifetime needs to increase too if their design cycle no longer so rapid
Cygnus OA-6 deployed at least 4 @SpireGlobal cubesats today from the @NanoRacks external deployer - anyone got the deploy time please?
@AstroKatie @ZachWeiner @mcnees Interesting question.  Towards the center it may affect things. But it's mostly in primaries perhaps
@AstroKatie @ZachWeiner @mcnees But (for now) other 90% will NOT vote against you just because of the guns issue. So you swing +10 your way.
@GeorgeWHerbert @rocketrepreneur @yag1968 @Rand_Simberg @SpcPlcyOnline  GT2 spacecraft reused  but new rocket
@yag1968 @GeorgeWHerbert @Rand_Simberg @SpcPlcyOnline Sure it is. Adding wings doesn't stop it being a rocket.
@GeorgeWHerbert @Rand_Simberg @SpcPlcyOnline Yes  OK. Good point. Slipped my mind.
@SpcPlcyOnline RSRMs had apogee of about 70 km  in the mesosphere  so can argue NS is first reusable *space* rocket.
@Skyrocket71 The story is that Geizer/Potok was also used for the Bankir network but I don't know if that was just partial transponder lease
@Skyrocket71 To be fair  Kupon failed before entering operational service
@Skyrocket71 Correct!! A lesson in not believing the satellite owner's press releases for claims of "firsts"...
@spaceguy87 @arianecornell maybe she'll actually start using twitter then?
@FakeAstropix @BenjiHND Hard to explain ram pressure in tweet  in my head was extending the concept of friction but in retrospect a bad idea
The @NatReconOfc NROL-37 payload has been spotted drifting in GEO over the Indian Ocean as expected https://t.co/xR3gYCUPyR
@FakeAstropix OK  fair point. I was speaking too loosely.
@cosmos4u @cbs_spacenews Not clear when TsUP's web page was last updated though  could be Bill's numbers are more current.
@hubbahubble @ScolesSarah I have no doubt you will be an amazing advisor. And looks like @TheBanneker have a great group.
@hubbahubble @TheBanneker @ScolesSarah ∞ ago?? Sigh..  Seems like mere moments ago to me...
@cosmos4u Here's a capture of it for your pleasure https://t.co/HALoUBe3y5
@cosmos4u Hmm.  well the official TsUP website seems a reasonably primary source to me. I don't get any malware warning on firefox.
@orbital_decay  Fab idea! This week is also Sally Ride night too  so we could have Badass Women Astronauts Week.
@CubeCheeseBryan @Skyrocket71 Well if you're going to name your sats intruigingly  gotta expect that. Need to update https://t.co/2TXonmodeK
@Skyrocket71 oh wait  sometimes a twitter handle gives it away  must be @CubeCheeseBryan :-). "Nate" is a bit more anonymous...
@Skyrocket71 So Becca Dewey  Russ Muzzolini and Jordan Bridgeman but don't know who Nate and Cubecheese are!
@RichardFPenn a cite to "McDowell  2016" with URL would be appreciated if possible.
@RichardFPenn There is a table with the relevant numbers on page 54 of https://t.co/rAkxKTqlOC
@lorengrush @SpireGlobal This was PAO on NASA TV just now  I don't think I misheard
@vacant3rdman Question is  can you get a 3-sigma error on the diameters small enough to see if USA250 is   say  20% smaller than USA268?
@Skyrocket71 Further alternative  one can read the budget doc as indicating that N2 was cancelled and never flew (funds zero after 2011)
@Skyrocket71 Alternative scenario is that the RS-68A launches 2012/2016 are NEMESIS and the 2014 is the last ORION
@Skyrocket71 But I can't figure out which earlier one would be the N1 candidate
@Skyrocket71 The Wikileaks names fit better if one of the earlier ORIONs actually NEMESIS 1 and 2014 launch is N2  making this one ORION 8
@marsjoe @SpaceJosh @AscendingNode @Simberg_Space Ahh.. thanks  that's good to know.
@Skyrocket71 I was wondering if it could be one of the leftover 'Naughty Boeing  we're giving some of your launches to Atlas'
@Skyrocket71 I did  although I am reevaluating that.
@Rand_Simberg @marsjoe @SpaceJosh @AscendingNode Yes  exactly like that :-)
@marsjoe @SpaceJosh @AscendingNode @Simberg_Space But was there ever an RL1 to RL9?
@Skyrocket71 I didn't see a release from ULA confirming success  can you point me to it?
@smith_randallk @NatReconOfc No  I'm happy for the sensor details to be classified  "ORION 9" would do. And it's "100mRadioDishPointsDown".
@SpaceJosh @AscendingNode @Simberg_Space Confirmed in my files that manufacturer consistently uses RL10.
The @NatReconOfc and other US military payloads are registered with the UN with a bland "USA" cover name - this one will be USA 268  I think
@rappolee Probably not. Expect Stage 2 to do depletion burn to sub-GEO orbit.
A @ulalaunch Delta 4 Heavy took off from Cape Canaveral's Space Launch Complex 37 at 1751 UTC on the @NatReconOfc Launch 37 mission
Today's @ulalaunch Delta IV Heavy launch attempt: @ToryBruno says "arrg" which I think means "scrubbed for today due to weather. "
@genejm29 That's a generic D4H GEO mission  not specifically NROL-37 I assume?
@NASASpaceflight reason to believe exactly such a deployable umbrella of about that size is hiding under the hood (not sure rainproof tho)
@doug_burke @libcce @space_qual @adafruit @SatNOGS I think it belongs on the roof of my car
@StefanBarensky @timmermansr I think it's clear @planetlabs have a pretty good basic design.
@StefanBarensky @timmermansr @planetlabs That's a *little* unfair (but only a little?) and better than a perfect 20-year design cycle
@StefanBarensky @timmermansr @planetlabs That's by design though - low orbit  rapid reentry  Si valley style rapid design cycle improvements
Four more @planetlabs 3U cubesats deployed in pairs this evening at 2355 UTC May 31 and 0310 UTC Jun 1 from @nanoracks NRCSD-8.
Looks like @NanoRacks deployed another couple  with Flock-2ep No 5 and 6 now in orbit - no deploy time annoucement yet
@Space_Alex @aerospatium Oui  semblable au GPS  tant qu'il porte une horloge atomique pour la navigation
@tehWKD Thanks  was just going from the Novosti story
@SP_JohnSullivan @torybruno @45thSpaceWing My accent is indeed a deep mystery - complex influences
@brianweeden It was just after launch. Now it's in 1436 min GEO stationed at 1.0 deg west.
@mikeseibert @cirquelar Yeah  I am sort of waiting for the thing to burst apart and all of the pieces float majestically away
@VeerabadhranS Communication. Will end up in circular GEO
@mirikramer @johnwenz @kchangnyt  not for the first or last time
@cosmos4u @aussiastronomer Too expensive I think; depletion lowers it a bit to shorten life
@OrbitalATK Do you have a more accurate launch mass for #Thaicom 8 than vague 'around 3000 kg'?
@cosmos4u @aussiastronomer Currently 6 Falcon 9 second stages junking up geotransfer orbit.
@aussiastronomer It's space junk. If they follow the same profile as last mission  it'll stay in geotransfer orbit and eventually reenter
Thaicom 8 has separated from the Falcon 9. Congrats @SpaceX @OrbitalATK and Thaicom
@mirikramer @kchangnyt Well not you either of course. I'm digging myself deeper aren't I...
@markmccaughrean @e_astronomer believe that is correct
Follow @NASASpaceflight for BEAM module expansion updates this morning (I am on travel so can't follow along) https://t.co/swPoODRu4x
@cosmos4u boo hiss...
@SteveShawCA @kencf0618 @elakdawalla @pallavabagla @Davis_404 Not convincingly. May change soon  but in most areas SpX behind them for now
@kencf0618 @elakdawalla @pallavabagla @Davis_404 Top space actors Russia  US  China  Europe; 2nd tier Japan and India  others way behind
@NASASpaceflight thought 0130Z was the predicted time per the NOTAM?
@NanoRacks Congrats  and question: what happens to the old  empty NRCSDs? Still on ISS  returned on Dragon  or disposed on e.g.Cygnus?
@RainerKresken @markmccaughrean Needs to learn something but am still not convinced of a causal funding correlation of human spfl vs robotic
@markmccaughrean @ESA I have that one on my fridge. I love the poetic sentiment despite the questionable celestial mechanics.
@NanoRacks Thank you for the rapid clarification! @Skyrocket71 @planetlabs @SpireGlobal
.@NanoRacks says last 4 sats were @planetlabs Doves but @skyrocket71 thinks they were @spireglobal Lemur-2 sats. Waiting for clarification
@Skyrocket71 Interesting; @NanoRacks says they're @dovesinspace + I had thought all Lemurs were on Cyg deployer but your theory makes sense
@aussiastronomer @hubbahubble @UW Well said Jessie. Very true.
Watching @orbital_decay on NASA TV right now talking orbital debris. Way to go  Lisa!
@thomassturm Possible  but they'd have fallen in the ocean.
@Skyrocket71 We'll see. Would not be surprised since they prob want to test the newest tech
The @nanoracks NRCSD No. 7 has been loaded onto the MPEP ready for the Kibo robot arm to take it outside to pop out a bunch of cubesats
@jablan Actually rechecking  NASA statement says 2.51pm EDT which could be right. Others say 2.55pm EDT. 11.31 could be typo for 11.51.
@jablan Might be parachute deploy time?
@jablan I think NASA repeated SpaceX mistake; one in PDT other reported in EDT. Don't think values can be correct  but maybe I'm confused
@omcintyre Yes  and she has a new one coming out soon  I'm very excited.
@sparklefingered Mine's an Android but hey...
@hubbahubble @EllieInSpace awww fab photo
@Skyrocket71 oops - I was sure I did the extraction after adding the new one!!! Thanks
@Skyrocket71 Which one am I missing? https://t.co/8d8oZ3ZGSF
@ConnorJ_W @NASASpaceflight No  I think you're confusing it with French 'zilliard'  which is different again.
@NASASpaceflight Is that a US zillion or a British zillion?
@lorengrush Me too! That's the trouble with internet virtual launch parties  no way to share snacks...
@RonBaalke Really  you had to pick that RDJ travesty?
.@JLGalache  Yes @EllieInSpace gave a fabulous talk! Warmest congrats Dr. @EllieInSpace - &amp; great that you'll still be in the area.
@omcintyre (Not trying to be difficult  just not sure what advantage you're seeing here)
@omcintyre @wshcrew Which is discarded before Mars entry  so don't see advantage over Atlas V launch? Or direct Falcon 9 launch w/no Dragon?
@omcintyre @wshcrew Don't think it could roll out the hatch. Seems riskier than repeating Curiosity which we know worked.
@Cosmic_Carol Just using traditional Douglas Adams units...
@Cosmic_Carol HST is also equiv of 1/4  of a surprised sperm whale  or 20 thousand bowls of petunias. Just saying.
@Cosmic_Carol In a battle between 2 elephants and HST  I'm afraid the elephants would win.
@omcintyre Heartbreaking. Gutwrenching.
@RussianSpaceWeb TBH I don't understand why this 'first Vostochniy launch' and not '6th launch from Svobodniy recently renamed Vostochniy'
@RussianSpaceWeb Do you have more precise times for the Volga burns?
@markmccaughrean @aallan The Space Act agreement implies NASA will swap DSN time for EDL data from the mission.
@lorengrush Still  good for NASA for providing DSN support and so on.
@Rand_Simberg @AscendingNode Strongly doubt that applies to this first mission
@brianweeden Absoutely. I think it's a very exciting step forward  and will probably happen as soon as 2020 given typical @SpaceX delays
@astrocrash I believe the answer is kinda-sorta. @JasonKalirai can amplify...
@markmccaughrean Yes  mentioned those further down the stream! Congrats to @ESA__Education and the Torino  Liege and Aalborg teams
@e_astronomer @markmccaughrean Other than for angular momentum storage  not as far as I know
.@UCSSatDB Extract from what's already in https://t.co/FnSbxLCbW8 - what's new is decoding of serial numbers
@wikkit @hhallam Ah ok the turtles were not airborne at the time. My brain is exploding a bit less.
The @NASAKepler mission started science observing again today after its recent recovery from emergency mode. Hooray!
@Mad_Science_Guy I think he was special for the US fans in particular  for my gen in UK not so drastically I think
@Mad_Science_Guy I do recall Zoe the from-a-future-space-station astrophysicist (played by Wendy Padbury) made big impression on 6yo me
@Mad_Science_Guy @realscientists I would say many of them made the role their own. Too bad so much of Troughton era lost...
@realscientists Pertwee (+ Troughton) big factor for me too. Plus fact that all my babysitters were physics grad students #GatewayToScience
@DownHereOnEarth certainly no intention to limit the microcanine flux in your feed :-)
@DownHereOnEarth not disjoint sets? some of us definitely rather fuzzy. Will try not to be miffed at implication we're not all adorable ;-)
@PenguinGalaxy @startorialist &lt;waves/&gt; Hi Alice!!
@PierceODonnell @startorialist @NASAWatch Amazon.  "Zero galaxy thick coat'.
@startorialist Summer - I heard rumours of you from the OATK gang.. I was at Chandra booth of course  6309. There tomorrow too.
Just trying to keep @startorialist proud of me... https://t.co/fchLjg3bSH
@NASASpaceflight do they use Brillo pads?
@SP_JohnSullivan @RT_America @RT_com ouch I usually take metro from airport but this time at last minute got cab - phew!
@SP_JohnSullivan have spent many happy days in @airandspace
@RocketAcademy @zulfikarabbany @ArmsControlWonk ITAR sucks but govts (even sometimes Russia/PRC) are on average opener than SpaceX/BlOrig
@RocketAcademy @zulfikarabbany @ArmsControlWonk I do worry about transparency  open data - Milner is ok on that front  Musk less so
@NASAWatch @lorengrush @sokane1 Total respect for @zacinaction's Sprites. That part is close to being ready.
@NASAWatch @lorengrush @sokane1 Don't mean to poo poo. It's very exciting. But worth pointing out where the physics challenges are.
@lorengrush @NASAWatch Oops sorry @sokane1 ! My eyes are glazing over a bit at this stage...
@lorengrush @NASAWatch I think Loren's article is spot-on. It's a great project but there are big  big challenges.
@ajebson @lorengrush Yes  they claim they can get low bit rate downlink with optical laser but it's going to be a challenge
@lorengrush The true cost is person-hours  ultimately. Redirecting a few of those from defense industry would be good.
.@lorengrush I do worry about the inferred average acceleration of 20 thousand g's. Can the sail survive that?
@lorengrush Unclear exactly what the $100M will buy. But I think they can make real progress.
@DownHereOnEarth @CatherineQ @DrMRFrancis @Summer_Ash Ah  at least I grew out of *that* fantasy years ago.
@CatherineQ @DownHereOnEarth @DrMRFrancis @Summer_Ash Smart  I should probably just do the same
@sparklefingered This particular satellite will fire a retrorocket and parachute its experiment samples back down to land in China.
@sparklefingered To counteract the effects of drag  yes. Also possibly to tweak path for better landing opportunities
@DownHereOnEarth @CatherineQ @DrMRFrancis @Summer_Ash Yes  but why does it kick to max the night before an early important meeting/flight?
@AstroKatie @tweetsoutloud @brianwolven @ziyatong but of course your main point I am in complete agreement with.
@AstroKatie @tweetsoutloud @brianwolven @ziyatong But if reality is that ppl only care/know abt celebs  good if some celebs are scientists.
So Bigelow's putting money on reserving an Atlas  + @ulalaunch investing modestly in the supporting engineering. That's a good development.
@ulalaunch @BigelowSpace Thanks
@JayAlver Sure  I get it. Just important for spacefandom to not get overexcited thinking this is an actual funded mission.
@SpaceKate Wow! I'll be very interested to hear how that goes. Good luck.
@SpaceKate Where are you moving to?  Save travels!
@AscendingNode He sounds like he's making it up as he's speaking though  or am I imagining that?
@ulalaunch @tp_1024 @SpaceKSCBlog @BigelowSpace But in general  putting stuff on a live youtube channel would be more portable
@ulalaunch @tp_1024 @SpaceKSCBlog @BigelowSpace Yes  have now installed Chrome browser thanks.
@AscendingNode @ulalaunch @tp_1024 @SpaceKSCBlog @BigelowSpace Thanks. installing google-chrome-stable... hum hum... ok works now
@ulalaunch @tp_1024 @SpaceKSCBlog @BigelowSpace Also getting that error and unable to watch (Firefox on Linux).
@NASASpaceflight But who is putting up the money?
@dotMudge @GeertHub @erinleeryan as for non-space  verify fixes on test server before pushing to production server!
@dotMudge @GeertHub @erinleeryan Not unique  but the main thing is replicate situation on ground copy of hardware.
@dsfpspacefl1ght Ahh interesting. So maybe not so different.
@_garywhite_ Interesting  although it doesn't give a primary source. I've been guessing 1000 for the trunk too.
.@rocketrepreneur @_garywhite_  Bear in mind Soyuz has the same mass and carries much less cargo.
@rocketrepreneur @_garywhite_ Heat shield  elec power  propulsion  recovery system  pressurized cabin - like to see you do it lighter!
@GeertHub @erinleeryan This does sounds like an extra-deep safe mode  so less likely fully benign. But certainly too early to panic.
. @_garywhite_ Total Dragon mass at launch including cargo is around 10.7 tonnes. Mass without cargo around 7.6 tonnes  that's cabin + trunk
@_garywhite_ No  that just gives cargo masses  no constraint on spacecraft mass
@AuerSusan That's my guess  and it's about the right size.
@AuerSusan Correct. And I suspect L is the HXI instrument from the end of the optical bench. Altho' JAXA think  might be solar panel pieces
@mwlphelps @BadAstronomer @alexwitze No.
@Jillian_Scudder @sondy One of my profs had the chair of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy  and I think that's a cool desc of what we do
@Jillian_Scudder @sondy Having said that   I do like the fact that astro was one of the 7 classical lib arts.
Elon: used to be a barge but we added engines etc so now it's a ship.  NB @alexwitze :-p
@lorengrush I'm shocked it's not taught in US elementary schools.
@Jillian_Scudder @sondy .... Cambridge hasn't changed its paperwork since Whewell invented the word "scientist". So  still "BA". (2/2)
@Jillian_Scudder @sondy Very much so. No such thing as a major  you do one subject.  But... (1/2)
@astrotweeps Don't think they've ever broken down the delta-V for the three return burns. Decelerating hard for sure.
@Jillian_Scudder @sondy I have a BA in Maths  all Cambridge degrees were BA (even Engineering I think??)
@prgrmr42 199 IIRC
@Simberg_Space and they learnt a lot of propulsion from ground static tests. Not saying unimportant  just uninteresting to *me*.
@Simberg_Space No  that's just a toy :-). Well  it doesn't leave the troposphere  so not the same thing at all.
@sandentotten 6 if you count CRS-7 which blew up before beginning the boostback
@RocketScient1st @SpaceX It is important  and it annoys me that launch 'casts often don't talk about it :-)
@DougonIPComm Very good point
@alexwitze :-p
@planet4589 @AstroKatie @tweetsoutloud @SarcasticRover I mean  lasers are provocative enough. Typical American diplomacy...
@AstroKatie @tweetsoutloud I'm hoping you mean RTG. I didn't realize @SarcasticRover had RPGs; no wonder the Martians are scared of it
@spacecom 0 Million? Are you sure that shouldn't read 0 Billion?
@johannateske @penn_state @hubbahubble  true + quite a few of them awesome SAO REU alums  :-)
@sparklefingered radars and some AirForce optical telescopes. But indepedent observers with binoculars give us orbits for the secret AF sats
@astrokatey @MJIBrown :-) :-) Thank you...
@mirikramer It does seem the obvious question. Also  if their jackets are simulations  can they open-source the code for them?
@mirikramer wow :-) Cool  man.
Congrats @AmyMainzer  https://t.co/VnqJcymLSl
@_starbase_ wherever  depending on fluctuations in the density of the atmosphere
@lexcalibur100 @rappolee @spaceguy87 @elakdawalla You kids and your apps...
@lexcalibur100 @rappolee @spaceguy87 @elakdawalla https://t.co/stWEA2SG00
@rappolee @elakdawalla Major launches now at Tanegashima rather than Uchinoura/Kagoshima
@spaceguy87 @elakdawalla Apparently flaring to mag -2 tonight.
@spaceguy87 @elakdawalla Possible  yes. Without time  RA  Dec can't be sure.
@OldCrank Yes  they are flashing to very bright magnitudes. Alas I am too far north to look for them (max 31 deg)
@rappolee @NsightI @RonBaalke @NASAJuno @CassiniSaturn As long as they put the Centaur data in JPL Horizons I'm happy
@vacant3rdman Strictly speaking there was the Endeavour GAS payload in the Shuttle STS-67 payload bay.
@vacant3rdman fair point
@markmccaughrean  ... I still feel that 'all eggs in one basket' is a bad strategy for this or any other discipline  however golden the eggs
@markmccaughrean And indeed some very good friends are on the JWST science team  they are the best and have all my respect. But..
@markmccaughrean Travelling sucks these days anyway.
@davehuntsman @Rand_Simberg @PaulFDietz @SciGuySpace Don't care whose control.Arianespace as good as US   not going on some cutrate Rus ICBM
@SciGuySpace Nothing I haven't been saying for 15 years.
@SciGuySpace @NGC3314 Because it is tumbling and different parts of it are catching the Sun (maybe a flat surface like a solar panel)
@aschwortz Let me know the next time you're in the vicinity and up for lunch...
@aschwortz Yes that was very probably me! Sorry I didn't spot you.
@cosmos4u @blueorigin Good catch!!
@cosmos4u @blueorigin I infer from capsule markings that same CC flew on all 4 New Shepard launches.
@cosmos4u @blueorigin Good question. Based on previous flights  capsule and rocket apogee &lt; 1 km apart.
@NGC3314 Yeah  so that's 41337. Until a couple days ago you were looking at 41442 so that's why it looks different
@NGC3314 This is the current object A  41337  yes?
@LilyRex @NASAWatch @mansharamani will have to put further snark on hold while I watch batfleck punch superglum for a while
@NASAWatch @mansharamani I am shocked that you didn't already
@NASAWatch @mansharamani .. just to say that any one analysis  no matter how authoritative  will have arguable (not wrong) assumptions
@NASAWatch @mansharamani Ah OK. Fair enough. There's also question of how much of basic center costs should be charged for this analysis
@NASAWatch @mansharamani Not sure that includes costs of Shuttle program - which was essentially dedicated to ISS during assembly
@DownHereOnEarth Yep  that was exactly my reaction when I saw the new data. Hoping against hope that there's something I'm misunderstanding!
@AuerSusan Nice job.
@markmccaughrean @esa_tgo Could just be thermal insulation or something  that had no impact on telemetry etc
@markmccaughrean @esa_tgo I don't think tank would still be in view at the time of the obsns. And 4 burns is par for course for Briz! But OK
@markmccaughrean @esa_tgo ... and no details of actual timing  magnitude of post sep burns. So I don't think this puts issue to rest.
@markmccaughrean @esa_tgo Interesting - "the day was 'neprostoy'" implies maybe not all to plan. No explanation of the observed objects...
@redplanet00 @markmccaughrean @ESA_Rosetta Fred  I want to preorder them on Amazon right now!
@sondy excellent portmanteau of 'limelight' and 'lifetime'! "Sondy is a legend in her own limetime". Should get it into dictionaries.
@alexseiji @astrolisa @JAXA_jp Absolutely. That is the aim. If JAXA can successfully contact it  that's what they will try to do.
@alexseiji @astrolisa @JAXA_jp It's definitely tumbling
@_garywhite_ Yeah the high rates are leading me in that direction
@sparklefingered What kind of data do you need? Catalog of debris objects on my site at https://t.co/lAoxd53TgY
@sparklefingered @CanberraDSN Have a job already  as long as Chandra doesn't do a Hitomi. But thanks.
@elakdawalla @tweetsoutloud @Rileah Yay  awesome team!  Lucky @astrokatie. 1 of these days really am going to have to meet the rest of you.
.@_garywhite_ Awesome. Scary large Jonathan. I just saw myself on the repeat. A bit frightening!
@sparklefingered @CanberraDSN Nope  I'm talking about JAXA's station at Mingenew near Perth
. @b0yle Can't argue against any of the ones above me  everyone should follow them
@DarrenBaskill @Pharaoness @elakdawalla Yes  still a very bad situation. But better than no signal at all.
@astrolisa @JAXA_jp A few pieces flaked off. It's still mostly in one piece. Obviously the bits that came off were not fatal.
@slacka1967 @JointSpaceOps There are such facilities. Not clear if Japanese have requested US use them.
@brianwolven @LarsTheWanderer @lukedones Won't be in DC area until about 3 weeks from now  sorry!
@LarsTheWanderer @lukedones I suspect more probably an internal event.
@JudgeWen @AsteroidEnergy @SpaceTrackOrg  No. There are now 6 consistent element sets in the lower orbit.
@AstroKatie @JossBlandHawtho @jbprime So I should multiply by 0.26 to get Omega-BH which is what I think in.
@planet4589 @AstroKatie @jbprime @JossBlandHawtho Oh wait I remember - Omega(DM in BH) over Omega(DM total)
@AstroKatie @jbprime @JossBlandHawtho Thanks Katie - what is "DM fraction" in this? Omega-DM over Omega-nonLambda?
@jbprime @JossBlandHawtho I worked with Bernard Carr on that stuff - see McDowell (1986)! Curious too what the best current limits are.
@RainerKresken @AuerSusan @SpaceTrackOrg I do. Seems consistent with some venting.
@rappolee Mostly  yes
.@RabAusten A debris strike is possible  but given the timing during spacecraft commissioning I think an onboard event much more likely
@starstryder We do work quite hard to try and avoid it!
@morfca yes
@starstryder If you release sufficient energy within the satellite  that will happen. (battery explosion  cryo overpressure...)
@chrisenorth I agree with your estimate.
@jqmcd Ah  so I must have known you? The memory  it's having bit errors these days... I arrived '88 as a postdoc.
@jqmcd Ooh  love ARTEMIS too. I might hit you up for an archive of their lunar orbital ephemerides at some point for the historical record
@jqmcd Ah  that's what you do? NuSTAR rocks. Please drive safely! :-)
@sparklefingered Overall space astron's had a pretty good record. As we always say in this business  space is hard. Now and again you lose.
@Litsas Yes  or possibly cryo system overpressure
@robcarrphoto @PeterDEdmonds It's on https://t.co/8WzZEGbHgW but you need an account
@PeterDEdmonds I retract my earlier optimism now that we know there is debris
@PeterDEdmonds Not good. But it sounds like the sat isn't totally dead  so let's hope it's a fixable software issue...
.@phi48 Yes  but you have to get Cygnus to that slow relative speed  starting from an Earth-fixed launch pad. That's impressive.
@vacant3rdman Indeed  time  place  *and* velocity. (If only first two  what you have is an ASAT).
@vacant3rdman Yes of course I didn't specify rest frame! But given started at a geo-fixed launch pad  fair way to point out precision needed
@squaregoldfish @markmccaughrean Are you sure they didn't stow away on Philae? Would explain why 67P wasn't so welcoming to it.
@cosmos4u Yeah  I'm assuming. So means different things for different approaches.
Unfortunately latest TLE for Cygnus on @SpaceTrackOrg is 24 hours old; however @NASASpaceflight reports rendezvous is proceeding per plan
@Pillownaut Sigh.
@PeterDEdmonds @alexwitze  Best-done major science press conf I've seen. Hadn't realized the awesome @whitnutt was behind it! Whitney FTW.
@me_too Well you have to bring the oxidizer with you - explosion is mostly just very fast burning  if can burn things you can explode them
@RussianSpaceWeb @rappolee @NASAWatch Don't get me wrong  "Explosion" is definitely one of the likely possibilities
@jqmcd Final stages for all probes in your list except Cassini  which wasn't direct to Jupiter
@RussianSpaceWeb @rappolee @NASAWatch 'Explosion' implies the pieces ejected with significant KE  we don't have trajec data to show that
@RussianSpaceWeb @rappolee @NASAWatch Could be insulation pieces  chunks of ice  or a non-violent disintegration.
@rappolee @RussianSpaceWeb @NASAWatch "obvious that ..had exploded" Exploded is a strong word. Can shed debris without exploding
@jqmcd Fair point
@bigunderscorec @AstroKatie @blakestacey No no no  we're #scicomm astronomers  promise our best not to confuse you more than we already are
@DrMRFrancis @AstroKatie @blakestacey Let me know if you visit Boston and we'll totally do a tweetup.
@RocketScient1st @OrbitalATK Would be excellent to get the delivered-to-ISS cargo and the rest separately at some point
The @OrbitalATK OA-6 Cygnus carries 3395 kg of cargo - not clear to me if that includes the post-undocking cargo of Sapphire and NRCSD
@Pillownaut "dog-leg". Means changing left-right direction as it heads up the coast. Does not involve making puddles though
The @OrbitalATK Cygnus OA-6 cargo ship is counting down to launch aboard @ulalaunch Atlas AV-064 at Cape Canaveral
@lorengrush ... waves hand.... meeeee!
After completing its docked mission at ISS  OA-6 will use an external @NanoRacks deployer to eject five cubesats  prob. @SpireGlobal Lemurs
@rappolee @jeff_foust @cristinepulliam Hard to tell. Could just be pieces of insulation or even chunks of ice. Or it could be a bad thing
@JayAlverYeah  I am not sure either. Maybe @planetlabs or @OrbitalATK can comment on OA-4 cubesat payloads?
@JayAlver There are at least 18 @PlanetLabs Flock-2d  maybe 20?
@brianweeden Clearly the correct solution is to mount your workstation on a treadmill
@rappolee @ms_doxie Briz-M 'burial orbit' is still heliocentric. Just misses Mars by a long way
@rappolee @ms_doxie Yes  it's heading into solar orbit.
@bigunderscorec Several reasons. I think 80 is closer to a realistic lower limit for space. Need to finish the paper where I argue this!
@NuclearAnthro @drspacejunk @vacant3rdman TRAAC was the first ever gravity-gradient boom test  by the way
@NuclearAnthro @drspacejunk @vacant3rdman TRAAC was Transit Research And Attitude Control  sat was a side project in Transit navsat program
@vacant3rdman @drspacejunk @NuclearAnthro Just went to a talk by a LosAlamos guy who loved NERVA but wants to do fusion rockets.
@rappolee @ms_doxie Yes  the 3rd stage stays in orbit. But it's a big empty can with lots of drag so it reenters in like 2 days or so
.@PeterDEdmonds I already switched it off following   https://t.co/RIc5olBR3q  Tweetdeck isn't affected I think.
@DownHereOnEarth @keiranrowell I'm a quasar guy not planetary sci  tho I've dabbled in asteroids. For me  Pluto's a world but not a planet
@shaka_lulu I'm sure everyone would have know what you *meant*!
@shaka_lulu That should read "isn't JUST an astronomer" of course - @hannah_jc is an excellent one!
@NuclearAnthro @vacant3rdman @drspacejunk Oral historians should come chat to Fred Seward here  among others
@vacant3rdman @NuclearAnthro @drspacejunk Indeed. I actually know some of the people who were involved in STARFISH PRIME. Crazy stories.
@drspacejunk technically  grasshopper neuroblasts. To study radiation effects. Why  I have absolutely not the glimmer of an idea.
@drspacejunk Also found a 1961 suborbital shot with grasshopper brain tissue. +lots of "simulated human tissue" (not brain)(w'ever that is)
@drspacejunk Not aware of that. Apollo 17 had a study of radiation effects on mouse brain tissue.
@markmccaughrean although I did keep waiting for Baelish to do something evil!
@markmccaughrean @PlatigeImage Everyone here at Harvard/CfA was in awe. We had a special showing in the auditorium.
@markmccaughrean @esa_rosetta True. In particular  "Ambition" was just fabulous. And the various ESA blogs have some very good stuff.
@markmccaughrean Understood. Shame that ESA gets so little public credit for what it does compared to NASA.
@markmccaughrean while I'm at it  for arrival kit I'll lobby again for separate backshell  frontshell masses..for my 'objects on Mars' list!
@markmccaughrean Fair enough. I do feel press kits had 10x more tech detail back in the '70s though!
@markmccaughrean Nice job on the launch webcast by the way!
@markmccaughrean  And this is the sort of info that should be in the press kit  I shouldn't have to dig it out of the state vectors
@AscendingNode Good point
@VeerabadhranS Pretty pictures are not my area of expertise - you want to check out @russianspaceweb who has some great ones
@DrVonBraun @spacecom Shouldn't that be "EtTuFaba?" (if I have the vocative case correct...)
@arielwaldman @BasilLeaf I don't know... that's about a minute in round trip radio-signal travel time  1-digit-off clock error?
@mrbeamjockey @VaticanObserv @DrStuClark @VanHyningV Would be nicer yet if the generic 'nuns' didn't erase their names as individuals
@megschwamb @astrotweeps Not really  they have been holding events like this since Giotto in 1985. Their funding depends on VIPs not public
.@DrStuClark I would love to learn more about Annie Russell and other English analogs of the Harvard Computers
@DrStuClark @HughO2 Could be usefully stolen - I mean recycled - today  e.g. to apply to a prominent politician here
@DrStuClark hope you saw I credited you in the next tweet (couldn't fit in 140 chars!). Nearly finished SunKings  enjoying much!
@hhallam @RussianSpaceWeb The little SOZ ullage engines make two burns  presumably similar to the usual ones for GEO missions.
@elakdawalla @uhf_satcom I just took the drop tank TLEs and I added enough delta-V to get the right energy-at-infinity.
(@RussianSpaceWeb  others: what is the difference between Briz-M 885xx and 995xx? Design? Factory?...)
@jtskowronek @cgbassa @RussianSpaceWeb :-) No  NL = Netherlands !!
@slacka1967 @go_for_launch Burn increases the velocity to 10.7 or so. The drop will happen over next few days as it coasts out.
@go_for_launch aaah  gotcha. That was my problem. Thanks.
Per correction from @go_for_launch  the geocentric inertial velocity of ExoMars drops to 3.712 km/s as it enters solar orbit
@go_for_launch Ah  thanks. The C3 I saw must have been an old value.
@RussianSpaceWeb They cataloged it as object C which implies they think it's the tank. But the payload's in a very similar orbit - for now!
@beatgr @AscendingNode So wish I had saved my punch card stacks!
@AdeptInvention @Cosmic_Carol was intended as Fortran77  I've never coded in VHDL!
@beatgr @AscendingNode I remember WATFIV! And F66 before that  in middle school in 1973
@AscendingNode Also  I can't stop myself from trying to figure out how I would actually pass the orbit data using COMMON
@AscendingNode I wondered who would be the first to pick up on that. But F77 is still the best computer language ever. :-p
@go_for_launch  Good luck for the final burn! Some friends want to try and track Briz signal  do you have predicted post-burn state vector?
@AscendingNode Doesn't quite have the same poetic ring...

My main story on @BreakfastNews was of course the intentional crashing of @ESA_Rosetta on Comet 67P  reuniting moth… https://t.co/JxTpZ4Equ4
Fun start to a week chatting astronomy on @BreakfastNews with @mjrowland68 and Ali Moore on the couch. Oh yeah and… https://t.co/u5Xc6t7Htl
@fredengles2 @BreakfastNews it was a final beautiful effort!
No worries @theprojecttv I'll ask the robotics team in @Swinburne https://t.co/nGaT7y7JVW
@kumitaguchi you're basically rick-rolling national news with the Swans
@kumitaguchi haha such a stirrer
@mareetimms well recognised!
@BeijingBetty @Melissandre_L oh no too late I've moved on already but I loved Florence!!
@Melissandre_L close its Italy :)
@mca178 @lisaharveysmith @KellMorco I was just thinking if @Swinburne did that Sally?
@_Ali_Gray it really is stunning
Can't wait to see the online version of this but I imagine @AstroKatie put my @BreakfastNews efforts to shame! https://t.co/UKk7QEloS9
I adore @FireballsSky and have the app  download and join the hunt for #meteorites too! https://t.co/wUH7EZlNrY https://t.co/XlwRUhym8W
Good luck to @lycrageek / @FireballsSky and my other legend colleague @lisaharveysmith for the #Eureka16 !! https://t.co/ZUilRKeIkJ
@tcortellesi my understanding was it was too close to be anything other than tidally locked but direct imaging should tell us either way :)
@tcortellesi sadly the atmosphere is in no way guaranteed. Dwarf stars are highly active and megaflares can strip the planet's atmosphere
@strom_m I know right?! But my honeymoon takes preference so I'll just sit back and enjoy the excitement
@PatriciaKimtia @eurekaprizes @Swinburne thank you!!
Membrane proteins are targeted by 2/3 of current &amp; planned pharmaceutical drugs so critical research on @Space_Station @BreakfastNews
These @Space_Station crystals give a clearer scan of protein structure &amp; more targeted drugs to be designed for us on Earth @BreakfastNews
Onboard @Space_Station proteins grow into larger crystals than on Earth @BreakfastNews https://t.co/0P9zwxRZS2 https://t.co/3WGR6jWIM6
To get to Mars @NASA's new SLS will have 4 of these rockets (&amp; 2 boosters!) giving more power than Apollo-era Saturn V  @BreakfastNews
RS-25 test fire by @NASA gave lots of steam &amp; enough force to accelerate your car 140x Formula 1 car @BreakfastNews https://t.co/FEBKheWnHJ
My last chat on @BreakfastNews before a month-long honeymoon and we turned it up to 11! https://t.co/tI1CvDMNq3
@ZULU401 @BreakfastNews don't need that rocket to weaponise space  big enough rockets exist for that already. SLS is for exploration only
@pembertonfilms @eurekaprizes @Swinburne thanks sonya!!
@DMerrillees @ProfBrianCox @SydScienceFest @maasmuseum @CoEPP @Aus_ScienceWeek it was an honour to be part of such a wonderful event!

Happy #NatSciWeek everyone! Swing by @Swinburne to see our scientists exploring cells  robots  and the Universe https://t.co/x0DwyVopOj
@strom_m will I see you there?? Make sure to say hi if so :)
@mamalaafsbooboo @BreakfastNews certainly not! :)
@strom_m @ScienceChiefAu I hope that over time we can change that focus for the good of society and our country.
Grads can struggle to get foot in door but with #STEM can apply for range of careers- key is Uni course w industry placement @BreakfastNews
The MWA radio telescope reveals star's explosion is ploughing into unexpectedly small amounts of wind from progenitor star @BreakfastNews
On @BreakfastNews I shared @caastro_arc's cool radio observations of an exploded star SN1987A https://t.co/S9J5j4dqeE
@missjmelville @abcnews yep!
@MerrickPhillip yes the early dynamics of our solar system is a surprising time but note this is all cutting edge so details may change
@MerrickPhillip this research article is a good start https://t.co/6sd90jfUUZ
Surprise but well deserved honour as @RiAus inducts @ProfBrianCox as BraggMember for his scicomm #briancoxliveau https://t.co/1xoLmm7KMD

@AstroKatie @mareetimms oh that's cool to hear I've only just seen this thread but I was def unclear about how'd they react :)
@Astro_Jamie @Seth_HIMself @drspacejunk oh no I hadn't even thought of that happening on my next flight!
@heath_smithers @BreakfastNews we just detected atomic oxygen on Mars back in May with @NASA's airborne telescope! https://t.co/KThsycYW78
The complex gravity from 3 stars pulling the planet around will likely cause chaotic motion ultimately kicking it into space @BreakfastNews
Tatooine eat your heart as this newly discovered planet found by @ESO has 3 stars @BreakfastNews https://t.co/c76ZEzW7PO
#CrabNebula is remnant of exploded star seen in 1054 by Chinese astronomers @BreakfastNews https://t.co/QTnUykgkXU

@astronomyblog good you clarified
@MatthewRWBarker @ClubMelbourne @SwinNews @Swinburne thank you!
@r_conandavies @NASA @NASAJuno couldn't agree more..! Heroic work by all involved..!
@robandart tell that to my mum  she doesn't recognise me when I phone..!
@robandart I'm blaming my wife
@RobertGaristo whoops!! Thank you!
@upulie @Summer_Ash @MaddowBlog @MSNBC it works well for us down under yeah :)
@upulie @Summer_Ash @MaddowBlog @MSNBC nope tomorrow(!) around 1.30pm AEST so not a 4th July arrival for Oz :)
@goodie4pj very gracious thank you! :)
@goodie4pj never!!! :)
Good luck voting today Australia! @ScienceAU helpfully complied 3 main parties stance on science / #STEM #ausvotes https://t.co/8Jtgv9cQW9
@AstroKatie @drarnakarick nah I didn't know about it and I'm double booked now
@RuthKearin @AAOastro that's fantastic to hear..!

@goodie4pj eeeeuuuuw. I'm now an Aussie but still can't eat that
@goodie4pj @BreakfastNews @Space_Station high praise indeed if it had some delicious honey on it..! :)
Blemish seen by @CassiniSaturn is a 'jet' likely caused by gravity of Prometheus piling up material @BreakfastNews https://t.co/Rnxv4Fpx6G
Rings are 120 000km across but just 20m thick in places  beautifully sculpted by 'shepherd' moons @BreakfastNews https://t.co/fU8ocgmPx2
On @BreakfastNews @NASA's @CassiniSaturn found a blemish in flawless rings of #Saturn https://t.co/VY2GU8lbaO
Even more advanced tech in #ASKAP by @CSIRO_ATNF  called PAFs they're radio version of digital camera @BreakfastNews https://t.co/12Th0UrqT6
On @BreakfastNews got to highlight @CSIRO_ATNF's next-gen tech upgrading the world's largest telescope China's #FAST https://t.co/cshF5U2ZMM
With 3D printing can create spaceship parts as needed as well as advanced manufacturing in Oz (&amp; fascinators for @LaTrioli!) @BreakfastNews
Fun #space chat on @BreakfastNews showing off student designed 3D printed tools on the @Space_Station https://t.co/pwjmP6KJoZ
@drraghnall @ABCNews24 @LaTrioli @mjrowland68 glad you enjoyed it! Although I hope you're not too late in the end!!
@Hetah101 @Swinburne thanks for coming..!
Got a question for @ProfBrianCox? If you're a student @RiAus will help you ask him as he tours Oz! https://t.co/TZg4etlmXf
Thx @SwinburneAlumni &amp; @Swinburne for all the huge efforts behind the scenes for my 3-city #swinastro talk series! https://t.co/RMduxihU5G
@drarnakarick @astro_stephi @ET_astro @ProfAstroSarah cool! I'll have a play soon and give feedback/plug it then??
@jyenormus @Swinburne @qldmuseum thanks for coming!
@AusAndgie7 @ClaireHickey22 @RachelPupazzoni @astro_timpeake @ABCNews24 that's so cool!!
Yesterday was Canberra  today it's Brisbane to chat #astro w @Swinburne alumni! #AcademicNomad continues thx @Qantas https://t.co/t77rST4YPo
@BenSciGuy that was wonderfully mad
@Roj_Ame @VICEAU @aamer_rahman @NevenaSpirovska agreed :)
Can't wait to speak alongside the legend @upulie at #SpaceUpAus https://t.co/1PA24U3xtl
@merrdiff thank you!!
@merrdiff is this from published work by any chance??
@D023604 thanks Andrew! A nice video by @fcain at https://t.co/2pTrio7Iua the brane world model by Lisa Randall https://t.co/fP36HHYUFN
Final @BreakfastNews discovery was a 'chain' galaxy found by 2 Russian citizen scientists w @radiogalaxyzoo https://t.co/hGDhsPLfQN
On @BreakfastNews the latest light pollution maps make for a depressing sight https://t.co/zLRdBO3jrW
Clumps of gas seen as shadows by #ALMA against glow of hot electrons spiralling in magnetic fields @BreakfastNews https://t.co/eFKcBG3oSi
On @BreakfastNews explained new way to feed #SuperMassiveBlackHoles by cold clumps of gas raining down https://t.co/L6KtxR00Zn
@MerrickPhillip great idea! I can suggest it for a break out group
@MJIBrown definitely although don't know when that will be!
@MJIBrown @NASA thanks!
@michaelaye @MarsMaven @abc15 wow that was a solid guess by me :)
@Cosmic_Horizons @cosmos4u yes this tension has been known for years but the explanation that it's dark radiation during CMB is a big call
@Hellionworks @sandygrains @HUBBLE_space they wouldn't have any noticeable effect on us now as universe has expanded reducing their density
@Hellionworks @sandygrains @HUBBLE_space more research. For now it's tantalising and HINTS there's a new type of particle out there
Finally on @BreakfastNews make sure to look for #Mars in eastern sky after sunset- closest point to us in over a decade so bigger &amp; brighter
Glycine is an artificial sweetener so the discovery of key ingredients for life found in space is tasty as well as amazing @BreakfastNews
Huge finding of glycine  an amino acid used by life  by @ESA_Rosetta on #Comet67P @BreakfastNews https://t.co/6g3sv0QeeN
Next on @BreakfastNews I showed the amazing 3rd successful landing by @SpaceX at sea https://t.co/61xz4ALazF
Great fun chatting to @LaTrioli on @BreakfastNews about inflating a space station with #BEAM (&amp; maybe space hotels!) https://t.co/lB75YZv26I
My home for the day at @AAOastro speaking about my latest research on how galaxies grow! https://t.co/o6MvOjL0VK
Congrats Alan! Our @ScienceChiefAu officially a fellow of the prestigious @Science_Academy  https://t.co/E97lx2gayp
@MBObservatory I'll give it a go!
@bencubby @ConversationEDU thanks Ben! :)
@mrbenjaminlaw @upulie I'm now getting a restraining order
Best way to start a week  chatting #space on @BreakfastNews https://t.co/o20swn82EP
My article for @ConversationEDU on the shifting magnetic poles on @BreakfastNews https://t.co/6ZPbVFEXeL
As the Sun was dimmer in its youth we thought the atmosphere would be thicker to trap heat &amp; stop Earth freezing @BreakfastNews
Next on @BreakfastNews was a surprise discovery that the young Earth's atmosphere was far thinner than it is today https://t.co/nLjUdzEVHo
At current rates in a few centuries your compass will point South instead of North  but Earth will still spin as normal @BreakfastNews
A longer term change in our magnetic field is that the north and south magnetic poles are flipping! https://t.co/lPOpWx0cQ1 @BreakfastNews
The pulses in the field are directly tied to changes of the molten iron 3000km below our feet @BreakfastNews
On @BreakfastNews I explained @esa #Swarm satellites seeing rapid changes in Earth's magnetic field- its heartbeat https://t.co/OHta6bu8vo
Thanks for the chat @BreakfastNews ! Great questioning @Mad_Morris too..! https://t.co/KEYR44uMTx
@AndySHastings @OrbitalATK @Astro_Duffy @Astro_Precourt @Astro_Rommel @Astro_Tani rather more deserving of the Astro Duff name than me! :)
@dfblokes @AAOastro I hope you voted!!
@Tim_O_Brien @NASAKepler VERY hopeful ;) I'd settle for getting to Alpha Centauri!
The @NASAKepler discoveries are all over 1000 light years away so sadly we won't ever get to travel there to see the new planets
nice work @strom_m &amp; @BridieSmith definitely showing #innovation with that story link :)
By doubling its previous haul of alien worlds @NASAKepler has confirmed that planets are common in our Milky Way with billions out there
Potentially another 1327 worlds seen by @NASAKepler but not quite at 99% certainty to claim it https://t.co/XqdFhvBOES
Impressive increase in number of worlds discovered @NASAKepler (seen blue to orange) note big planets easier to see https://t.co/nk18JaaKMS
New techniques to rapidly &amp; efficiently remove false positives (ie light dimming not by planet) doubled tally of worlds found by @NASAKepler
A planet is 'seen' by @NASAKepler as it passes between star &amp; us blocking light just like #MercuryTransit -&gt;bigger planet blocks more light
@ErinVincent1 @mjrowland68 @LaTrioli @BreakfastNews @abcnews @ABCTV @ABCNews24 good luck team! :)
@ClearSkiesTV @Aus_ScienceWeek @Astroguyz @AstronomyNow @sydneyobs exceptional work all! Much better than my inner city view!! :)
My colleagues in @Swinburne discovered two 'peanut' galaxies  cool way to end a week https://t.co/O4WNGmgk18 https://t.co/PhkrILRhmN
Them's fightin words @LeonieHilliard @robinince @ProfBrianCox
Welcome year reprieve for @AAOastro by @cpyne @karenandrewsmp during which we can develop a long term astronomy plan https://t.co/sPBUHpy4Zl
@MerrickPhillip hmmm I've seen timelapses work so worth a go but as they last a second or so you probably have to do a composite
@MerrickPhillip towards the east but it's not critical as they can come from any direction
@AunatEridu @lisaharveysmith that's huge!! Great work Lisa and #ASKAP team too!
@jegpeek @Dropbox I do :) and Google drive and time machine. I just don't have a spare computer to access them!!
@GruntledChalkie I have everything crossed for that..!!
@MBObservatory @SKA_telescope ha :) yep that definitely was on my mind
@mareetimms huge win  crows were so impressive though!
@goodie4pj thanks but honestly this is a huge meeting of minds and it's an honour just to sit at the table!
Last week I would have said exploring the stars was only in Star Trek  this week incredibly it's possible (not easy mind!) @BreakfastNews
Breaking news on @BreakfastNews was @NASA tech to scrub CO2 from air in Mars now used to improve craft beer on Earth https://t.co/5DCClvmEbY
First story on @BreakfastNews was the incredible #Breakthrough #Starshot to reach the stars in a lifetime https://t.co/gjFzSfxo0E
Fun Monday chatting about my fav things in life  space and craft beer  to @mjrowland68 @LaTrioli on @BreakfastNews  https://t.co/bZinC7Hdu7
@brew_o_clock @BreakfastNews apparently it's economic even for a few thousand barrels... So not quite home brew but getting there!
@DrPhiltill dude. Stop teasing :) where's the additional info..? Sounds tantalising!
@Aus_ScienceWeek @Swinburne national science quiz in May  no need to wait till August! :)
@r_conandavies thanks Richard! I explored some of these for @CosmosMagazine in https://t.co/gjFzSfxo0E
@AusAndgie7 @CameronMcEvoy nice to e-meet you! We could try explaining the messy background of gravitational waves using your pool sometime!
@upulie yeah it's real. Incredible but real. :)
@GruntledChalkie hope she wins!
@RobertGaristo @AstroKatie confirmation with greater sample size and improved accuracy  second nature paper is computer modelling of SNe
@brendonbrewer @charliepick he's so much fun to chat with but terrifying to be interviewed by as tends to jump around a huge range of topics
For those morning haters who miss my #space segments with @BreakfastNews I’ve written it up on @ConversationEDU https://t.co/RNNxT4496w
Final story on @BreakfastNews was exciting launch by @SpaceX of @BigelowSpace #BEAM - an inflatable space habitat https://t.co/xRB03jVaVy
Centre ring is same as Earth's orbit around our Sun- could be baby (10m yr old) snapshot of us! @ESO @BreakfastNews https://t.co/NP1BChynon

@LeonieGSmith ah ok well @SpaceCampUSA is absolutely incredible so that’s fantastic but sorry to hear it was so limited!!
My chat to @BreakfastNews on @NASA_Hubble seeing stars  @ESA_ExoMars Martian methane &amp; insulting R-Adelaide (sorry) https://t.co/DFM9vcq16i
@MBObservatory originally yes but something last minute came up :(
@callumdav @BreakfastNews otherwise it's confusing ;)
On @BreakfastNews plugged national release of Capturing the Cosmos by @scienceworks_mv feat @caastro_arc research https://t.co/hOhK8bCzBn
On Earth life makes methane (eg methanogens in cow guts  aka farts) but also volcanoes. @ESA_TGO will discover which on Mars @BreakfastNews
I told @BreakfastNews about the @ESA_ExoMars launch which sent @ESA_TGO to 'sniff' out methane on Mars https://t.co/SNoy3tGoSy
The monster stars are 100x mass of our Sun  30000000x as luminous and MUCH larger @BreakfastNews https://t.co/osy3N63bzc
9 incredibly bright monster stars were seen by @NASA_Hubble in our neighbour 160000 light years away @BreakfastNews https://t.co/lzAKuoswq2
Great fun explaining to @BreakfastNews monster stars  Marian farts (for @mjrowland68) &amp; new planetarium shows  https://t.co/bOsda26v0J
@scienceupulie @MayanAp0calypse in the end politeness prevailed although he did guess my opinion based on how I phrased the questions :)
@scienceupulie @lisaharveysmith glad to hear it :)
@lisaharveysmith @scienceupulie I certainly enjoyed it :) not sure if anyone else did!
Learning at @Swinburne about new worlds &amp; our solar system from two of our best astro PhD students https://t.co/OvK2dLiT7H
@SaraJamesAus @CanberraDSN @NASA @plutoport @NewHorizons2015 have fun! I love seeing the comms dishes  makes space feel so much closer
@CanberraDSN @NASANewHorizons @plutoport they're gonna have so much fun :) it was a really cool story  definitely Hollywood-esqe plot!
@astronomyblog I love @unawe ! Can't believe they made that..!!
@astronomyblog well at least I can properly credit it in my own talks :)
@astronomyblog I hadn't realised that was yours! @mikewhitmore please credit others photos  otherwise (like now) we think it's your image
I adored hearing from @tamarastro @DrEmmaLJohnston @scienceupulie @ScienceChiefAu @bgreene tonight. Bravo #QandA More science specials plz

Hearing from @lappinscott on #AthenaSWAN &amp; her personal reflection on supporting women in STEM at @Swinburne https://t.co/pu72Rub1yx
@drarnakarick yeah he's a creative guy!
@rdrimmel @LIGO @ego_virgo perhaps Australia may rethink about this amazing opportunity too 😇
@katedempseycom @RiAus he sure was! Incredibly small effect even from colliding Blackholes (which he doubted even existed too)
@astronomyblog @apod this may well become the astronomy equivalent of the millennium bug :S
@astronomyblog @DrDa5id @jegpeek I've got the paper in front of me :) definitely GW150914 in the article at least
@MGntl @klfliedner @RiAus yes you're right  the gravitational waves have a frequency that corresponds to middle C in sound that we can hear
We've just seen #gravitationalwaves and they kinda look like this @RiAus #showusyourwave https://t.co/wzJi3RDGvo
@PeterDEdmonds @AstroKatie @StephaJuneau yes! Disappointing how many leaks there were although perhaps amazing there weren't more
@CosmicRami @AstroKatie @drspacejunk @upulie perfect!
@AunatEridu @CSIRO_ATNF @lisaharveysmith nope sadly it's all booked up!
Finally on @BreakfastNews is boomerang gas cloud slamming back to Milky Way at million km/h https://t.co/aKKv0lXY7b https://t.co/gpIji0UuhX
A supercold 'flying-saucer' on @BreakfastNews is an edge-on planet forming dust pancake https://t.co/WlOnu5bgpv https://t.co/baFI7dQcsk

@Helen_E_MC haha thanks I reckon you're right!
@AusAndgie7 @esa @social4space @AstroKatie @CSIRO_ATNF :) this time is super fun deciding on the new next generation radio receivers..!!
@AusAndgie7 @esa @social4space @AstroKatie rats! I'll be discussing Australia's other radio facilities at @CSIRO_ATNF in Sydney then!
Great summer effort on @BreakfastNews by @paulwkennedy @albericie Welcome back @mjrowland68 @LaTrioli looking forward to some puns in 2016!
.@DJobling welcome back @LaTrioli we've missed you on @BreakfastNews :)
@PlaneTalking @upulie @AstroKatie @MBObservatory @whereisdaz @scienceinpublic I think that's correct to nominate yes
Where do I start? @upulie @AstroKatie @MBObservatory @whereisdaz for starters! @scienceinpublic may know more too? https://t.co/o0bOFZ5sWE
@MihoJnvr it's Melbourne fashion statement these days :)
@Cosmic_Horizons @brendonbrewer @flintoff11 @TheProjectV he's seen too many planetX claims. That and I stuffed up a cricketing metaphor.
@DRG_physics ah :( I thought that was suitably faint
@DRG_physics not impossibly so (~22mag or so perhaps) but definitely hard
@AlanAlanmoret @ABCNews24 maybe. Prediction looks intriguing but I'll believe it when I see it in the telescope
@Tina__Garrett @abcnews likely Mercury hadn't risen yet  it's going to be tough catching it just after its above horizon but before sunrise
@astronomyblog I agree :) thanks to Russell Grant alignment is probably the most known term which is why it's getting used for arrangement
@astronomyblog I would be happy with arrangement
@astronomyblog 2/2 where the alignment is creeping in but it makes it sound more technical I guess? Not the worst astro misuse I've seen :S
@astronomyblog I've been trying to point out that these planets form a line in the sky because we all lie on the same plane  not sure 1/2
@Tina__Garrett @Swinburne yes that will be near Mars  fittingly :) it's got a reddish tinge to it
@ProfAstroSarah @ThingsWork @JontiHorner will do!
@davidjseibuhr @BreakfastNews @abcnews the breakthrough listen project in particular..!
@AunatEridu @lisaharveysmith @smh @WorldSciFest impressive timescale!
@Theodore_Bear @paulwkennedy @albericie @abcnews @BreakfastNews @HashtagCuteness sadly my expertise in physics/astrophysics is no help here
@jegpeek @kathrynpeek that's a disturbing gift. Glad it's been used for non-nefarious purposes...
@MPakakis @Swinburne congrats!!
@Theodore_Bear thanks! I think the same about the heroes up from 2am to deliver news like @paulwkennedy @albericie @abcnews @BreakfastNews
@Janet_Morris_ never too late to learn! There's online astronomy courses I can recommend at @Swinburne https://t.co/dkLIVo9swU
What's powering this activity inside #Pluto is still unclear as the entire world should be frozen solid. Mysterious Monday on @BreakfastNews
Tracks in ice are edges of giant plumes of nitrogen ice rising up and crashing together like lava lamp 40km across. @BreakfastNews

@brianwolven @CrawliesWithCri that was an epically stylish cat
@iangriffin beautiful work!
@GruntledChalkie @astro_timpeake amazingly so!!
@upulie @Mandford @AstroKatie it'll be interesting to see who gets the gongs.
@AstroKatie @upulie @Mandford any idea how these scicomm'ers were picked?
@jehankanga @MJIBrown I would have struggled but reckon 200 words could have done some justice to the time lord
@CosmicRami @AstroKatie @drspacejunk @upulie love the look! Happy scientific festive greetings to you all :)
@mirikramer a huge night :) I can't wait to see how the refirb costings work out but definitely the beginnings of a new era in space age
@danielporter731 @CosmosMagazine @Swinburne nice
@Mighty_Ginge @CosmicRami @BreakfastNews @SpaceX let's hope!
@CosmicRami @BreakfastNews just recorded it for Evenings :) Ceres makes the list but Interstellar is so 2014

On @ABCNews24 @BreakfastNews I wrapped up my highlights of #SpaceIn2015 What a year! https://t.co/CSlxmZEIL0
5th #SpaceIn2015 @BreakfastNews story was #TheMartian A huge film but so true to the science you can teach with it https://t.co/o2Gv0kAVay
4th #SpaceIn2015 @BreakfastNews story was $100m hunt for ET by @brkthroughprize #BreakthroughListen of million closest stars for signals
This is the greatest #spacelettuce pun of the year @BreakfastNews  #SpaceIn2015  https://t.co/L80IPuvkQ8
3rd #SpaceIn2015 story on @BreakfastNews was #spacelettuce grown on the ISS. Demonstrating how we can explore space by growing our own food

On @BreakfastNews I gave my #SpaceIn2015 roundup- 1st was @NewHorizons2015 #Pluto flyby revealing a striking world https://t.co/I5Pd501PUb
@JackieSlav @Swinburne absolutely! It sounds like a fantastic project  let's try and get it started in 2016!
@drarnakarick nah this one is spot on
@dark_cypher @BreakfastNews @mjrowland68 just happened to have one spare in the wardrobe
Hey @BreakfastNews I hope Zak gives #ForceAwakens the thumbs up  from my PoV it was epic! @mjrowland68 will be happy for sure
@strom_m yes but only because I didn't make her watch episode I
@scottdbevan @kumitaguchi well I managed to see a couple and wished on them that next year there's zero cloud so let's hope that works ;)
@pfwaus @scottdbevan @kumitaguchi was there anywhere in Australia that didn't get clouded?! I swear I'm jinxing these Astro events
I hope Sydney had less clouds than Melbourne last night! Hey @scottdbevan @kumitaguchi any luck with catching the #meteorshower ?
@MelanieBagg @ABCNews24 ditto :(
@upulie go on be honest  weren't you impressed that things growing on minutes-hours timescales care about days? ;)
@DClaphamFRAS @Swinburne worth seeing! ;)
@DClaphamFRAS @Swinburne yeah it's never that great a meteor shower for us
@AunatEridu arghhh! 120 per hour!! Thanks for noticing that
@Contessa29er @abcnews it was always the least likely (just very cool) option :)
@CosmicRami @upulie @AstroKatie @drspacejunk @NASA_Dawn entirely appropriate.
@CosmicRami @upulie @AstroKatie @drspacejunk @NASA_Dawn I don't like to gloat (well that's not totally true) but I called it.

Learning about social media and science at @Swinburne from @thesocialsci &amp; look at the textbook example! @AstroKatie https://t.co/FLUiwKTx8Q
@MorphyMagic @jmmelican add Apple Watch mark 5 to that too
Learning about the (many many) horrible ways the world could end from @upulie at #Interrobang https://t.co/wD6zMjmLo1
@AndySHastings @upulie this should be an official state holiday
@askinterrobang @leaantigny @mrbenjaminlaw @upulie I'm offended I won when clearly my panellists were more incredible &amp; intelligent &amp; pretty
@AstroKatie @redrummy gasp! You said you thought the bowties were cool :( unlike @upulie who legitimately has always hated them
@AusAndgie7 I know and we should chat about it on Sunday but it's critically important for investors in US registered space industries
@mrcbqn @astrotweeps it's a fair point but it's also extremely relevant for investors of those US registered space industries
Learning about crowdfunding in science at @Swinburne by one of the experts in this space @DrMel_T! https://t.co/q5x4enVQgI
@cosmos4u @PedroTGFerreira fantastic!! A primary source to finally get to the bottom of it  great find!
@cosmos4u @PedroTGFerreira yes when I re-read that and realised what you meant I deleted it :) shouldn't tweet before coffee
@PedroTGFerreira @cosmos4u great thanks! Such an interesting period and yet unclear the exact way it unfollowed. I'll have to get your book!
@cosmos4u hi @PedroTGFerreira just read your recent interview and curious how Einstein unveiled his theory? Was it a lecture series in Nov?
@cosmos4u interesting follow up is https://t.co/6lQ9x6Rnfz where Dr Pedro Ferreira discusses these lectures (in his book The Perfect Theory)
@mjrowland68 @BreakfastNews still gold
@mazlangford @BreakfastNews I wrote my application in crayon. Seemed appropriate given my skill level in design :S
@cosmos4u the earlier papers I wasn’t certain of so that’s good to know!
@cosmos4u interesting  all the discussions I’ve been able to read distinctly phrase this as a presentation and not submitting the paper.
@AunatEridu that's why I can spring out of bed at 5.30am for TV so easily :S
@cosmos4u he presented the Field Equations of Gravity to the Prussian Academy of Science on Wednesday 25th 1915
@mjrowland68 @BreakfastNews @Mad_Morris wow. I'm still speechless
Big thanks to @BreakfastNews top experimental physicists  @mjrowland68 @Mad_Morris for helping with my experiment

@tassiedevil @BreakfastNews that's brilliant!
@upulie @realscientists congrats!!
@_Ali_Gray thanks!!
So exciting that @Swinburne sent #SDF students to @CERN to work on social/personal innovation #SDFGALA2015 https://t.co/XaHFVQ3WGX
@astronomyblog @jen_gupta excellent point  my suspicions are that that might be the safest way
@sandygrains well done for getting on board then!!
@sandygrains of course! I can quote most of the entire series :D
@mca178 @Swinburne @usceduau gasp! We need this so badly!!
@JoshFrydenberg well spoken  considered words to @BreakfastNews in an emotive time. Nice interview @mjrowland68
@sarahkendrew @sarahcruddas @Izuvthesqrll I reckon Sahara might need to be included as well as sandstone formation depth issue
@AusAndgie7 fantastic!! Let's catch up before nearby??
@Izuvthesqrll @sarahkendrew @sarahcruddas eventually yes it's a massive upper limit but a few km seems reasonable  what do you think?
@Izuvthesqrll @sarahkendrew @sarahcruddas sure. I'm guessing most is in Sahara but it's a starting guess
@Helen_E_MC @upulie @AndyRickie thanks for that!! Can't believe I missed it  definitely gonna be fun :)
@upulie @Helen_E_MC eh?! Was I??
@sarahkendrew @sarahcruddas assume most sand in ocean floor  so 2/3 of earth's area x (absolute max) 5km depth / few microns^3
@sarahcruddas @sarahkendrew I've looked at this before  fine sand grinds down to a few microns across giving a reasonable upper number limit
@sarahkendrew @drarnakarick @AstroKatie I hope that coffee break lived up to the super high expectations! Safe travels Sarah!!
@AstroKatie @sarahkendrew @drarnakarick where you gang at now?
@GruntledChalkie terribly drafty
Rob Knight reclaims 'astronomical' numbers for biology from astronomy at @Swinburne lecture. https://t.co/1ZPpm5aisy
@dark_cypher @abcnews @BreakfastNews current loss rate means that any new atmosphere we create would last for millions of years
@dark_cypher @abcnews @BreakfastNews absolutely  although terraforming a planet is currently beyond us now it's even harder
I told @abcnews @BreakfastNews of how Mars lost its atmosphere  how centre of MilkyWay formed &amp; private space race https://t.co/LUS0NmSWua
@Cosmic_Horizons @BreakfastNews planet wide aurora like Mars!
@Cosmic_Horizons @BreakfastNews yep they'll get even closer (and possibly break into multiple poles!) as the field reversal/flip occurs
@callumdav @mjrowland68 @LaTrioli @BreakfastNews it's honestly a privilege getting to chat space to them (and I was a far worse student!!)
@mazlangford @BreakfastNews if it helps that's when I got up too although you're a hero for having to deal with a baby that early!
Finally got to tell @BreakfastNews that $30m @glxp space race for private teams to reach moon is ON w @TeamSpaceIL https://t.co/TtNv02tRIe

@Mighty_Ginge @NASA @Swinburne undergrad physics
@Mighty_Ginge @NASA its high on my priority list. I'll hopefully be offering it as a research project next year in @Swinburne
Mars had oceans 3.5bn yes ago  today is a freezing desert. How? @MAVEN2Mars found Sun's wind blasted atmosphere away https://t.co/FmJ3lK8KpI
@AAOastro I had no idea!! Congrats @astropixie
@cosmos4u no idea  I was impressed by the figures and societal impact metrics that did get squeezed into a single tweet though.
@AusAndgie7 @Cosmic_Horizons @AstroKatie @ABCNews24 thanks Andgie those are my favourite facts of the day :)
@PeterDEdmonds we're versatile
@astroswanny @lowflyingrocks @AmyMainzer @DSLauretta @OSIRISREx look at that go..! Just 10s exposures??

@chris_tibbs :)
@chris_tibbs yep. Southern Hemisphere World Cup now
.@sandygrains more likely than aliens :) the paper ruled out dust cloud from colliding planets  stellar pulsation/variation  telescope fault
@danversj @NASA_Hubble @Swinburne great idea… I’ll do that today and get some popcorn handy :)
@CosmicRami @MJIBrown @KetanJ0 @AstroKatie certainly more likely than using them for tidal power ;)
@JazzTwemlow @MJIBrown @KetanJ0 @AstroKatie global warming is actually something we'd want on Mars to terraform it..!
@MJIBrown @KetanJ0 @AstroKatie not sure about that  my gut feeling is solar more regular BUT both are better than hydro on Mars :)
@upulie fun :) a good taste of what we'll have to do onstage!!
@noitall762 @BreakfastNews @kavita_jade that it's got a blue sky? Nope this is what @NASANewHorizons saw

Galaxy cluster in sim w/wo blackholes  they give lots of extra heat-&gt; stops galaxies growing @RogerLDavies @Swinburne http://t.co/gJRvTLzQkr
What happens when two spiral galaxies (like us and andromeda) collide? A mess! @RogerLDavies @Swinburne http://t.co/3wcV8abc8j
Blackhole grows from same infalling material that forms stars but energy from blackhole can stop this limiting both @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
@embilbie @EvilAngelPixie @RogerLDavies @Swinburne 100 billion billion billion billion lightbulbs :)
Is blackhole's huge gravity pulling in material to form stars? No! Only affects billionth of galaxy volume @Swinburne http://t.co/r5ZFs2YyAH
A clue is that both quasar numbers &amp; star formation in the universe peaked 5-8bn years ago @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
Curiously mass of supermassive blackholes are always ~0.2% of mass of the Galaxy. How does this connection form? @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
Most energetic 'active galaxies' are quasars- with 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000W of power @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
Supermassive blackholes can be highly active  blasting material &amp; radiation out into space @RogerLDavies @Swinburne http://t.co/Mt2iNrss3R
Using motion of these stars we can weigh our blackhole- 4000000x mass of our sun  that fits within Jupiter's orbit @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
Bigger blackholes can exist at centre of galaxies- we watch stars orbit around the supermassive black hole in MW @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
Blackholes can steal material from companion stars which heats up as it spirals glowing X-ray hot which we see @RogerLDavies in @Swinburne
Unlike galaxies  blackholes are not vast. Relative to galactic scales they're tiny - @RogerLDavies at @Swinburne
Full house (&gt;450!) at @Swinburne to see @UniofOxford's @RogerLDavies chat #Galaxies and #BlackHoles http://t.co/x6LYd0wflp
@FailedProtostar definitely a long term project but you've made a great start! :)
Beautiful changing view of Saturn by @FailedProtostar Its 'year' is 29.5 Earth years so 24yrs worth of shots left..! https://t.co/IdREdkXnHn
@AunatEridu cool!
@AunatEridu cubesats?? Not immediately obvious that they're suitable for low freq radio... What's the plan?
@dr_kazzah @mjrowland68 @LaTrioli @BreakfastNews nothing wrong with that :)

@RichardFPenn @Swinburne ok I'll try and get the link to the researcher's results and will pass on your concerns re the presentation too
@RichardFPenn @Swinburne so just to clarify was the stretch calling it Alzheimer's? (again it's not my research  I watched a 3 min talk)
@RichardFPenn @Swinburne which bit is the stretch? I can ask the doctoral candidate to send me a link to their research...
@RichardFPenn @Swinburne not my research but it's accepted CJD (form of dementia similar to Alzheimer's) is caused by "mad cow disease"
@pathobindotcom @Swinburne I'll pass this onto the researcher asap!
Results are in- superstar Emily Petroff is #Swin3MT winner! She'll represent @Swinburne at the national #3MT comp! Congrats @ebpetroff!

@dragonarchitect @mikamckinnon @IBJIYONGI exactly!
@JeremyYoung14 @Karlz_barkley right! That’s how good they are!!
@mikamckinnon @IBJIYONGI @dragonarchitect to figure out how I first answered that question for myself way back when. 2/2
@mikamckinnon @IBJIYONGI @dragonarchitect this is so true! Kids ask great questions that make perfect sense to them and I love trying 1/2
@13adh13 same.
@13adh13 I’m so frickin’ jealous of that kid’s costume!
@DrMRFrancis haha yeah more just expressing introvert solidarity. I has three days of events in a row this week so NO PPL TODAY PLZ. 😉
@DrMRFrancis I'm taking an entire introvert day. 👊

@prgrmr42 @DrMRFrancis it’s a joke about Stanford.
I also got to meet @lorengrush and @tariqjmalik outside of the Twittersphere and IRL!
@prgrmr42 I’m talking about conferences though.
@emilylurice @AstroAthens she came up to me last night thanks to my @Shadowplaynyc dress. ;) #StartorialWIN

@upulie yay it made it!!
@shannonmstirone JEALOUS!!
@HaleighCiel FYI Star Trek themed @AstroOnTapNYC tomorrow night at the @waystationbk! I won't be there but you should totally still go!
@ElevenPointTwo it's a quote by an expert.
@lorengrush how long are you around this morning?
"Entertaining and smart are not mutually exclusive" - @NatGeoChannel #CountdownToMars
@RachelFeltman are you coming to Mars this morning?!
@lorengrush just got let inside!!
@lorengrush I'm here  just waiting to be let in!!
@DrKellyODonnell FYI  she’s on twitter! @ShenovaFashion :)
@starstryder because the OED is too busy adding twerk and fleek.
@DrMRFrancis which explains it I guess.
@DrMRFrancis haha your feed is ahead of mine
@PlanetDr weirdo
@startorialist you got me way to excited about AGN for a second there… guess I’m going to have to make my own true AGN design. ;)
@lorengrush @mirikramer me tooooo!
@hubbahubble these struck me as something you might like! https://t.co/ThDZj3hGpg
@ProfChrisWelch yes. Best year of my life!! #MSS7
@mirikramer but I’m cool with that. https://t.co/X63y79tSGb

@DrMRFrancis @DrRubidium @sharkespearean just checked  there is only 2015 up on flickr
@DrMRFrancis @DrRubidium @sharkespearean does that include the photos you could have them take?
@sharkespearean @DrMRFrancis @DrRubidium specifically the one of all of us!
@DrMRFrancis @DrRubidium @sharkespearean GGC question: can we see the pics that were taken during the con anywhere?
@jaimealyse I liked the dancers best. ;) Plus the pet video skit is kind-of amazing.
@mcnees well played!
@mcnees not everyone can afford cable/HBO… :-/
@13adh13 the code for the elevator in the physics building used to be 3.14. ;)
@jaimealyse what the hell? That’s so frustrating!!
@DrMRFrancis that meteorite would have killed LEGO you!
@jaimealyse thought you might need one of these patches. 😉 https://t.co/dhEu9niPHw
@niais @PlanetDr same  I only just learned about this. How do they work?
@jaimealyse WOW thanks for sharing that!
@upulie this photo is amazing. ❤️

@jaimealyse can you send me a link if you get a chance?
@jaimealyse omg that sounds amazing. how is the robot?
@DrMRFrancis ^glory
@DrMRFrancis that’s what Blaze of Gloy is from!
@DrMRFrancis I want to go watch Young Guns now.
@DrMRFrancis I’ll make you famous. https://t.co/PDMXNE3jaD
@PlanetDr like this? https://t.co/rp0F4UUQUU
@kimberlykowal I’ll try and fix that!
@kimberlykowal I’ve been there one or twice I think but only for a day or two at a time.
@kimberlykowal What Joe said made me want to go visit!
@kimberlykowal is that guy based at the observatory full time?
@kimberlykowal I know right? He was telling me about someone there who knows so much about the technology from way back when.
@kimberlykowal I just ran into Joe Patterson in the elevator and he said you guys met yesterday!
@PlanetDr @elakdawalla is there a newer/more recent version of a water comparison like this? Also not just for ocea… https://t.co/LSSlUeLIzG
@GeoSciTweeps thanks so much!
@GeoSciTweeps awesome  thanks! so roughly 1979?
@aschwortz I mean liquid water right now  not in the past.
@adityasood @SmithsonianMag GOD I love that book!
@GeoSciTweeps I guess evidence  but for recent as in contemporary liquid water (as in not MARS)
@DrMRFrancis https://t.co/aEuZWASmmk
@powersoffour @astronomeara LOL this has nothing to do with actual presentation. See my timeline. ;)
@DrMRFrancis YES! https://t.co/oA6Hs7PgnC
@astronomeara got it already. superimpose.
@DrMRFrancis LOL all that brain power for one tweet. ;)
Superimpose was what I was trying to get at!!! Thx @DrMRFrancis for having a more alert brain than mine right now. ;)
@DrMRFrancis YES! THANK YOU.
@mikamckinnon I'm officially jealous.
@shannonmstirone bless you. 😘
@PlanetDr I’m all too familiar with that! :)

@outseide they are slight but enough to keep me at home instead of taking the subway to work...
@jaimealyse yep. I met her at Geek Girl Con. Her stuff is amazing. I bought three pairs of earrings on the spot. ;)
@jaimealyse oh and there’s a necklace version too. ;) @GeekStar1337
@DrMRFrancis so sorry to hear that. Hope all will be okay. (hugs)

@DrMRFrancis is that tonight?
@shannonmstirone I don’t see it as a flaw  we are just interested in the ENTIRE WORLD
@shannonmstirone only 10 right now! But over 4 different windows. LOL
@shannonmstirone haha  same - I put a ton in One Tab last night because I was watching video and wanted to free up some memory. ;)
@dalcantonJD @hubbahubble that is the most amazing thing. My new morning mantra.
@elakdawalla @PlanetDr @3Dmattias this is so going up on @startorialist!! Can I post the pics of you and Sarah with it?
@Alex_Parker @PlanetDr @elakdawalla @3Dmattias I needs one!
@PlanetDr NEED! Who made that? @elakdawalla I'm guessing? 😍
@13adh13 welcome to merica. Learn a book.
@afamiglietti indeed :-/
Now to text my friends at @OrbitalATK all the digital high-fives.
With soundtrack by @jegpeek and mini-peek. https://t.co/jRCBke9Tgg
@SpcPlcyOnline haha I just tweeted the same thing. ;)
@lorengrush okay next @NASA_Wallops launch  I’m coming over.
@aussiastronomer @OrbitalATK I used to work there and my boss was an amazing woman  now one of the VPs.
@aussiastronomer @OrbitalATK there was a woman on the live feed conversation. also Orbital has a lot of amazing women working there.
@lorengrush @mirikramer ok  we need to make this happen. Talk more after rocket launch? :)
@lorengrush do you ever take the 7 train or just the E? @mirikramer
@mirikramer @lorengrush we need a space team hang IRL!
@lorengrush ah  I’m near Polaski
@lorengrush wait  that’s where I live too!
@lorengrush what area of the city are you in?
Days like this I miss my @OrbitalATK aerospace days! It’s nice to work on things you can touch that aren’t light years away sometimes. 😉🚀
I’ve got all my fingers and toes crossed for my old employer @OrbitalATK &amp; my old colleagues still working there! 🚀🚀🚀 #Antares #Cygnus #OA5
@13adh13 GOOD LUCK!
@jengolbeck it was a while ago but @xeni did it - that’s what inspired me to do the same for my heart surgery.

@PeterDEdmonds haha  but it didn’t link in your tweet. But yes  @stephtdouglas is awesome in all ways.
@13adh13 awesome! 🙌
@stoutde I just wanted to point that out because it’s important to realize
@stoutde for future reference even joking about mansplaining as a man is not appreciated. you're privilege lets you joke. I cannot.
@DattaguruP and implied that you think they don’t know this already.
@DattaguruP yes because explaining  anything related to why the patriarchy is even a thing is patronizing to someone oppressed by it.
@DattaguruP I’m not sure why you think you need to explain the size of the patriarchy to me.
@shannonmstirone IT MATTERS TO MEEEEE!
@kcenicola @JetBlue not for this flight.
@DownHereOnEarth @MashableScience @mirikramer she's on her honeymoon!!
@DownHereOnEarth @MashableScience this is what happens when @mirikramer is out of the office.
@13adh13 that's a great feeling. 🙌
They also gave a shout out for the @OrbitalATK Antares launch &amp; I had to be the bearer of bad news about the postponement. #astronomerpedant
@PlanetDr what is all the art happening there right now?!?
@kejames @startorialist I gave her the idea. 😉
@DrMRFrancis SAME
@WMMANews here's what I found: https://t.co/qUBWgzdkPj. Is that what you are asking about?
@WMMANews Saturn's rings rotate in the same direction as the planet  but there is an exoplanet around another star that seems to be the opp.
New launch schedule for @OrbitalATK Antares is tomorrow 10/17 ~7:40pm ET.  https://t.co/ydZcyu4T0V #spaceistheplace
I confess I'm happy that the @OrbitalATK launch slipped till tomorrow because I was going to be on a plane today and would have missed it!

@hubbahubble my goal always. https://t.co/nhz13u5JNT
#WCW tl;dr 1) Today is Wednesday 2) @hubbahubble @sondy @berkeleyjess @celinecelines @LizNeeley are amazing women 3) They are crushing it.
#WCW @celinecelines founder of @slowfactory_ who makes the most beautiful scarves to both inspire &amp;change the world. https://t.co/ivwQsN7NqQ
#WCW all three amazing women (@hubbahubble @sondy @berkeleyjess) are featured in that CNN piece: https://t.co/Kk8U7lhFTK.
#WCW @sondy for sharing her story via #astroSH and always be there for me on my #fuckPTSD days. Don’t let the bastards grind you down! 👊
#WCW @hubbahubble for being smart  strong  inspiring in astronomy  fashion  &amp; life. And speaking out re #astroSH https://t.co/Kk8U7lhFTK
@hubbahubble @NASAKepler https://t.co/1F8DQ1QRE3
@hubbahubble oh goody I get to use a gif per date tweet! https://t.co/zG9KPlKpJ1
@hubbahubble I have so many Lauren Conrad gifs that are perfect for this. It was hard to choose. https://t.co/JQKRxQLjxF
@hubbahubble yikes that hemline is a little short for me… ;)
@hubbahubble @LOrealUSA LOVE. WANT.
@DrMRFrancis GOD MATTHEW
@13adh13 like so? https://t.co/PvvkW7WvCw
@vafarmboy yeah but the speed indicator didn’t show any of that happening...
@PlanetDr you did it right
@themadstone pretty much  yep ;)
@lorengrush yessssss
@nhuntwalker I’ll actually be in Seattle this weekend  we could work it out together!
@nhuntwalker @stoutde I am too! But too much on my plate this morning.
@nhuntwalker @stoutde #maththat
@nhuntwalker @stoutde haha  are you including math with that?
@nhuntwalker @stoutde I leave that to you  I need more coffee. ;)
@nhuntwalker @stoutde @mcnees both in our orbit and in the sun’s orbit.
@nhuntwalker @stoutde @mcnees I gave a talk this summer on the Sun which included how far we moved during the talk ~15min. ;)
@stoutde @nhuntwalker I got that too… 2.787782 light-sec/hr
@mcnees @nhuntwalker https://t.co/gK2oUDw1vN
@nhuntwalker through our orbit around the sun  it’s roughly 0.365818 light-seconds/hr
@nhuntwalker I can actually tell you that…please hold...
@sharkespearean —&gt; @turnbullet666 was just telling me about it.
@PaulDesman thanks for all your kind words!
@celinecelines did you have to cancel your full trip?
@jaimealyse I feel like you need to be my cruise director but for theater.
@celinecelines same. But it's probably safe to say I've had a better day than you. Hope you are healing and not in too much pain. 😘
@celinecelines how are you feeling? 💞💞💞
@PaulDesman I can't argue with that. 😊
@PaulDesman it got better later in the show as I recall no? But yeah  I agree.
@PaulDesman but @hardwick and I had a nice long chat about it on the @nerdist!
@PaulDesman thanks!! The convo was actually longer than what was edited into the show  but yeah not the greatest it comes off like that.
@RachelFeltman related: why is it so much fun to watch pretty people do nothing?!
@RachelFeltman this is your fault. https://t.co/fG1RjJLpVz
@RachelFeltman great now you’re going to send me down a rabbit hole of Lauren Conrad gifs
@nhuntwalker I will likely go kiss the washer he touched in my laundromat later this week.
@nhuntwalker did you see my tweets about part of #LukeCage being filmed ON MY STREET?!?
@GoAstroMo @imaginescience haha  YESSSSSSS. https://t.co/FLXxYYpPGm
@GoAstroMo Hey I just say what you’ll be doing the @imaginescience film contest! YAY!
@Alex_Parker I don’t know what FLIR one is but @astronomeara started a JWST selfie craze last year at AAS w/ the model. ;)
@DrMRFrancis same and same
@RachelFeltman welcome to the “IT’S IN THE SYLLABUS” club! https://t.co/rAUBLWUybW
@DrMRFrancis and yet it is. :-/
Pre- @NASAKepler v Post- @NASAKepler plot of known transiting planets (mass vs orbital period). 😮🤓 #outreach https://t.co/sOzZrczFXb
@jegpeek I fly to Seattle on Thurs...
@jaimealyse also being tall sucks for taking baths is a nyc apt. :-/
@jaimealyse related: I have a drafted startorialist post you are going to love. ;)
@hubbahubble I'm putting this on my list of things to look into "in all my spare time"
@hubbahubble haha. Sometimes google is your friend  sometimes it's not.
@shannonmstirone 😊
@hubbahubble yes would be interesting to see if anyone has looked at correlations btwn various pseudoscience areas that are common.
@iamstarnord @janagrc @hubbahubble it’s more believing that their motions have a direct impact on your day to day life.
@iamstarnord @janagrc @hubbahubble that’s actually a very popular outreach activity! Constellations  signs  myths aren’t the issue for me -&gt;
@hubbahubble either way tho my reaction is not to point and laugh.
@hubbahubble or conversely  by engaging to talk about real celestial science can be a gateway out of pseudoscience.
@hubbahubble I will definitely reflect on that. My initial objection to astrology is I feel it’s a gateway to more serious pseudoscience.
@jaimealyse truth https://t.co/vN2UBA1HSJ
@mirikramer I WILL MISS YOU https://t.co/MTvgku872V
@nhuntwalker @BrokenFiction for me  coffee as defined by Rosario. ;)
@celinecelines oh my gosh Celine  I hope you’ll be okay. Sending all my love. xox
@shaka_lulu Yeah I know it looks pathetic  @AliShaheed Muhammad got me doing calisthenics.
@PlanetDr if I did it any other way my family would disown me.
@shannonmstirone @nybooks @Millicentsomer it’s the nyt version of doxing.
@FlyingTrilobite @mcnees @AstroKatie I like it! Thanks! I feel like astro photography is often uncredited here but should be like any other
@13adh13 that was thanks to @jegpeek. It took us forever to come up with a name until the time it just came out of his mouth in the office
@13adh13 also for future pi fashion  you might like these: https://t.co/Hg2dvOibHQ
@13adh13 well that clearly needs to happen.
@13adh13 I feel like you would appreciate this shirt. ;)  https://t.co/pyFEyWvXn2
@FlyingTrilobite do you have a hashtag that you use for advocating (or scolding for lack) credit for images/photos? cc: @mcnees @AstroKatie
@LaMinda I’ve seen it!!
@LaMinda awesome  thanks!!
@LaMinda Yes  I saw! Just wonder if you had any favs given you’ve raised a cool kid. ;)
@shannonmstirone @SciencEric same
@shannonmstirone @SciencEric HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED!
@shannonmstirone @SciencEric I’m old enough to remember calling relatives on Sundays bc that’s when long distance was cheapest. ;)
@mcnees I love the title to that last one. ;)
@LaMinda Do you have any children’s books about space that you recommend?
@mcnees hey does cheeks have any favorite space/astro books?
@nhuntwalker at least we have twitter. ;) https://t.co/yPItVRLFAZ
@DrMRFrancis NOTHING thanks to netflix…. https://t.co/RzmDFtcaNd
@13adh13 I can’t wait to dive in! But I might need a time turner so I can read it all day today AND also binge on Luke Cage…
#Rosetta  #CometLanding  cc: @slowfactory_ https://t.co/miNtZURiVT
@slowfactory_ the post is up! :)
@hubbahubble yeah  it was for body language more than lyrics. 😘
@hubbahubble all the awesome by Sarah as well. https://t.co/J5sflc241x
@aussiastronomer this new “term” is killing my soul.
@DrMRFrancis related  now I need to do my hair like this.
@DrMRFrancis https://t.co/XSFaPibCqJ
@DrMRFrancis same…but also Stanford football. ;)
@DrMRFrancis well done
@JackLScanlan @mirikramer @AhistoricalPics MY FRIDAY NIGHT BRAIN KNOWS NO SUCH THING 😂
@mcnees I was feeling good so I came back to see what heart stuff you tweeted - SO COOL!
@DrMRFrancis @20tauri awesome!!
@DrMRFrancis did @20tauri make that?!
@PlanetDr @AstroKatie https://t.co/A7eoLyr26b
@nhuntwalker In that case I think you mean @AliShaheed *IS* the magic.
@nhuntwalker omg @AliShaheed did the score?!?
@PeterDEdmonds @TrueSciPhi haha the @nerdist bump. ;)
@DrRubidium I don’t think it goes that far  but I will if it comes to that!
@DrRubidium @DrMRFrancis I was just asking for the NASA contact providing my materials  they have to do full accounting/reporting on use.
@DrRubidium @DrMRFrancis what’s the expected audience size for DIYScience Zone (roughly)?
@nhuntwalker After I general some income by writing. ;)
@nhuntwalker I’m am trying to stay strong all day to get work done before I DO THE BINGE.
@DrMRFrancis @elakdawalla @KarenLMasters @AstroKatie https://t.co/Cv3tQkhvuS
@celinecelines could I write up a brief thing on Rosetta for your blog today?
@DrMRFrancis https://t.co/S595Slebof
@physicsmatt @AstroKatie I started the book over as soon as I finished it. It starts slow but builds so beautifully!
@physicsmatt @AstroKatie I binged the hell out of that when I saw it got to Netflix! Might have to do it again I love it so much.
Picturing @ESA_Rosetta as The Little Prince is helping me see this as a story w/ a happy ending. 💫 by @slowfactory_ https://t.co/4GlciZTWYi
@DrMRFrancis WHEEEEE! https://t.co/xx4TF0T7ZM
@phil_torres @AstroOnTapNYC no worries! Hopefully you can make a future one - next is Oct.27th. ;)
@PlanetDr me trying to comfort you. https://t.co/Dp9Nin3utq
My @AstroOnTapNYC tonight was about lunar libration  but I accidentally said lunar libation at one point. LOL
@Pillownaut omg i love that picture so much!
@mcnees only always https://t.co/jxlIsqtDpQ
@PlanetDr glad to know I can still get at least some sleep before the grand finale...
@PlanetDr I knew it was low but I had no idea it was THAT low. So crazy!
I think I can speak for @shaka_lulu and @PlanetDr when I say: COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET
@hubbahubble omg that is excellent use of that emoji - why I have not noticed/seen that before?!
I just got home from three hours of lunar loving w/ @AstroOnTapNYC  Now there is another desolate rocky body to drool over. #CometLanding
@PlanetDr does that mean it will really take another 8 hours to defend 16km? (my understanding was 7:20am ET touchdown confirmation)
@themadstone how did I miss it was that big?!?!? The plush toy version is quite deceiving... 😂
@mcnees awwwwww
@DrMRFrancis same  tho I like the fall weather! Tbh for all my coffee talk I can only have ~1 per day or my heart will KILL ME.
@DrMRFrancis same https://t.co/p8jU11QGZP

@upulie did you see the awesome E&amp;M mug I posted on @startorialist last week?
@upulie exactly!
@upulie ugh  that can totally happen and its brutal!
@shannonmstirone I don't actually eat either but I saw them in the check out line!
@upulie at least I came home with ALL THE SNACKS
@afamiglietti nice. When I taught a summer Astro course for HS kids in England I bought them galaxy bars and Haribo star mix.

@mgraves one thing I can say briefly is that it’s best to listen to what the ppl affected have to say and not just the ppl on the sideline.
@mgraves I can’t get into it at the moment  but you should read what others have to say in the RTs in my timeline. No shortage of coverage.
@shannonmstirone LOLOLOLOL
@shannonmstirone https://t.co/AyzAUx42yx
@shannonmstirone oh we can’t include One Tab if we do I win by a LANDSLIDE.
@shannonmstirone haha  26 is actually pretty low for me.
@shannonmstirone I did write him…we’ll see. It was such a good convo though!
@shannonmstirone I got 26. ;)
@Mad_Science_Guy yep :-/
@DrMRFrancis yep https://t.co/zlQFBxcVKV
@DrMRFrancis the piece is an interview  all quotes. dead.
@mcnees I wrote about that for my Week in Geek last week! https://t.co/fAqhVjCF8q
@josh_sokol I’ve been on iced coffee all summer but i like to do these vids w/ music whenever i can during hot coff… https://t.co/QAOZiPENpP
@josh_sokol so my tag should really be #plutoinmycoffee? ;)
@VanguardSTEM @13adh13 okay that’s awesome https://t.co/urjsJidUFw
@mcnees thanks for the heads up! 👊
@mcnees water is my therapy. 😍
@mcnees gah I want to go to there
@bug_gwen @GeekGirlCon @DrRubidium AMAZING 👏👏👏
@sharkespearean @LizNeeley i approve
@LizNeeley @sharkespearean I would walk 500 miles just to have b’fast w/ you two at 7:30am.
@MissAerospace *that* I can totally agree with. https://t.co/jBIO6z1jy1
@Paladin1969 I highly recommend it sometimes. 👍
@MissAerospace I really do appreciate this discussion even if my tweets might not sound like it!
@MissAerospace I will def discuss what is/isn't appropriate behavior overall  I'm just reacting to tweets of disgust towards her. :-/
@MissAerospace if it was I would have talked to them in private  not shame them on the Internet. (Not implying that's what *you^ did) 2/2
@MissAerospace yes but I attended IAC while at @ISUnet and that could have easily been one of my int'l classmates. 1/2
@MissAerospace just not rushing to be mad at someone whose situation in  I don’t know.
@MissAerospace again I don’t disagree about #womeninSTEM  but the fight in the western world is far ahead of the fight elsewhere.
@callacofield @astrolisa this is that venue  if you’re at a major conference with a diverse audience and live-streaming it to the world.
@callacofield @astrolisa but also students from all over the world. If you want good Q  have them submitted in advance.
@rboyle31 fair enough  then the event should have been press only.
@MissAerospace I’m not arguing again the who comment + question thing  but the int’l nature of this conference reqs less judging (to me)
@PlanetDr ALL THE TELECONS?
@shannonmstirone yeah I’m looking into it now. found this to start: https://t.co/iFDrCDjNpq
@adrianprw @AllPlanets @elonmusk @SpaceX this doesn’t sound great. https://t.co/iFDrCDjNpq
@shannonmstirone except for being homogenous. :-/
@adrianprw @AllPlanets @elonmusk @SpaceX I would assume so  but I don’t know numbers.
@mirikramer that’s where all the Russian behavioral studies come into play. ;)
@ageekmom I have no idea how I missed this!
I worked on the X-34 at @OrbitalATK before switching to astrophysics.  https://t.co/yLPAizTJqO https://t.co/6AnqP79wyq
@mirikramer reasons https://t.co/ZVSazZsoF0
@arielwaldman he really should have gone the Wizard of Oz route here. ;)
@arielwaldman that makes SO MUCH sense
@GeoSciTweeps @elonmusk oooh I like!
@now__space jealous! :)
@reneehlozek @SpaceX IT’S THE FUTURE https://t.co/hVKqWTeYdK
@now__space heather are you there?!?

@vafarmboy P.S. my brain is a little fried so I might have to just let sound waves hit my head.
@vafarmboy  NO PRESSURE!

@bcofengineering @NatGeoChannel haha  is it distraction? This is a tv wardrobe education opportunity for me.
@shannonmstirone @StarTalkRadio no clue?
@PlanetDr same
@astronomeara good point. I just hope they are watching!
@afamiglietti @DasJorge not arguing against that but when he goes over segment time or talks over her  mic should be cut. period.
@afamiglietti @DasJorge DISAGREE
@PlanetDr seriously  that one got to me
@PlanetDr omg fuck that shit.
@Elisotope @kejames bloomberg will have in on-screen though!
@kejames bloomberg tv will have fact-checking on screen...
@PlanetDr its haaaarrrrrrrd

@BenMakesTV @hardwick @nerdist haha  I haven’t listened yet!
@BenMakesTV @tarynoneill @NatGeoChannel @neiltyson @missmayim @hardwick @StarTalkRadio @nerdist I have awesome friends in mountain...
@BenMakesTV @tarynoneill @NatGeoChannel @neiltyson @missmayim @hardwick @StarTalkRadio time is hard. ;)
@BenMakesTV @tarynoneill @NatGeoChannel @neiltyson @missmayim @hardwick @StarTalkRadio and that means midnight for mountain?
@BenMakesTV @tarynoneill @NatGeoChannel @neiltyson @missmayim @hardwick @StarTalkRadio but what are west coast times?
@tarynoneill @NatGeoChannel @neiltyson @missmayim @hardwick @StarTalkRadio can you help @BenMakesTV?
@tarynoneill @NatGeoChannel @neiltyson @missmayim @hardwick @StarTalkRadio I never know what the west/mountain time zones do. LOL
@tarynoneill @NatGeoChannel @neiltyson @missmayim @hardwick @StarTalkRadio I don’t think so! I only know my time zone haha.
@mirikramer they could have just settled for spirit fingers tbh https://t.co/m8ycB4Qt4A
@DrMRFrancis @PlanetDr I speak whale. https://t.co/UX3xGjETxJ
@mirikramer I think you mean star whales right? https://t.co/Sllq9tSkyp
@DrMRFrancis @PlanetDr same
@porchdragon @DrMRFrancis no! sounds cool.
@DrMRFrancis in that case  I recommend Wall-E ;)
@DrMRFrancis fair enough. I told you I like the darkness. ;)
@DrMRFrancis I actually LOVED the book so much  I started it over again as soon as I finished.
@DrMRFrancis The Road would probably be most accurate. :-/

Former Washington Post reporter Joel Brenner says live on @CNN that Virgin Galactic engine wasn't ready for this kind of space travel.
@RobertGaristo The low correlation indicates that a number of the structures in the BICEP map are not from dust--leaving gravity waves.
@RobertGaristo Eventually  when Planck analyzes with BICEP  they are going to have to cope with the low correlation between the two maps.
@RobertGaristo Planck paper is interesting for what it didn't do: they didn't publish their own map of BICEP region &amp; no correlation study.
@RobertGaristo Our results on that map for the ratio of the E and B modes was the same as what they got  to w/in one sigma.
@RobertGaristo One of the five mapping methods we used (giving r = .099) was quite similar to the one Planck adopted in their latest paper.

@RobertGaristo If you try to station-keep just outside the event horizon  you see hot Hawking photons. Freefalling observer doesn't see them
@RobertGaristo Further inside--when astronaut is about to cross the inner Cauchy horizon. Yes  nothing big happens at the event horizon.
@RobertGaristo As the blue-shifted photons become infinitely shifted  they can cause a singularity that kills you.
@RobertGaristo So you see the future history of the universe passing rapidly in front of your eyes.
@RobertGaristo When you fall inside black hole &amp; look back outside  yes you see very blue-shifted photons which gained energy falling in.

@AscendingNode Our crosswalks can't repel congestion of that magnitude!
@AscendingNode https://t.co/5FolkRj5ZS
@jtuttlekeane Holy smokes.
@GeertHub Yes!
@DarkMatterzine @upulie I managed to work around that  sadly.
Currently listening to @AscendingNode present the most spatially-separated relativistically-simultaneous observations ever made.
@lukedones @kbiegel  It wasn't a hawk Was a HAWK LOBSTER
@PlanetDr This appears to be rather jumbled instructions for frying eggs and bacon. Or maybe I'm hungry.
@verbiscer @AstroCook Twitter: come for the snark  stay for the NIR spectra of icy worlds.
@lukedones I would  but the usual supply chains have dried up.
@PlanetDr @duetosymmetry Can report @booplefloof levels approaching nominal.
@AscendingNode @AstroCook I'm just switching from wine to gin.
@J_Noons @AscendingNode @Hubble_Live I think @kwalsh4 is in charge of that.
@AscendingNode @Hubble_Live There are vi galaxy clusters as well  but no photons can figure out how to escape them.
@lukedones Looks like a Purrl command to me.
@DrPhiltill I don't see any duct tape...
@NovaSilisko @jtuttlekeane @PlanetDr SOMEBODY GET CULBERSON ON THE LINE

@AstroCook @brianwolven @AscendingNode @verbiscer BALLOOOOONS
@brianwolven @AstroCook @AscendingNode @verbiscer Same arguments  through and through.
@brianwolven @AstroCook @AscendingNode @verbiscer JWST will be fine  but a waste of resources until we have an orbit for MK2.
@AstroCook @AscendingNode @brianwolven @verbiscer We considered all these options - practically infeasible.
@jtuttlekeane @AstroCook @brianwolven Not sensitive enough or capable of sufficient contrast  according to my reading of their papers.
@AstroCook @brianwolven Still a problem for reliable LGS/AO on a moving target; the TNO binary community has tried this with Gemini before.
@AstroCook @brianwolven I thought about it. Still not clear that it would be sensitive enough  and the cadence issue is still a problem.
@AstroCook @brianwolven And Keck is not sensitive enough.
@AstroCook @brianwolven So  pretty much HST.
@AstroCook @brianwolven Need high-sensitivity  high-contrast  high-angular resolution imaging delivered regularly and reliably over a month.
@brianwolven Need multiple recoveries to know. Only facility that is capable on paper is HST.
@brianwolven We are likely within 10 years of the season  but we don't know how close beyond that. Could be ongoing as we speak.

@SarcasticRover @OtherOrbScience @PlanetDr And space exploration IS expensive. And hard. And we work ourselves to exhaustion making sure...

@astronomolly @PlanetDr ... to place the burden of proof on the proposal text itself ...
@astronomolly @PlanetDr ... presented by a (hopefully) clear and cogent plan of work and management. I am much more inclined...
@astronomolly @PlanetDr ... of someone's current ability to lead a team based on my past perceptions of them  particularly over evidence...
@astronomolly @PlanetDr As a reviewer I would never have the hubris to think that I could or should be the ultimate arbiter ...
@astronomolly @PlanetDr I agree that leadership matters. I just don't know if authorlist and name recognition are the way to demonstrate it.
@astronomolly @PlanetDr What information do reviewers have to judge leadership quality by other than bias-laden name recognition?
@wowinthedetails ... Pluto and its moons are all subjected to the same population of impactors. But  can't compare them to  say  our Moon!
@wowinthedetails Since most of the craters in the Pluto system are created by impactors coming in from the rest of the Kuiper Belt  ...
@wowinthedetails ... about the relative amount of time that each surface has been exposed to those impactors.
@wowinthedetails Given that the same population of impactors strike each surface  the number of craters per equal surface area tells you...

@sondy @mikamckinnon Watching a SpaceX launch.
@mikamckinnon I thought that was tinnitus.
@BadPhysics @AstroKatie @kennicosmith Unlikely; eccentricity of the orbit is zero to our ability to measure it. @AscendingNode knows more.
@AstroKatie @kennicosmith It shares the same pole as the rotation of Pluto.
@wowinthedetails They do! We use them as chronometers  where more craters in the same environment equate to an older surface.

@astrokiwi @astrocrawford @mattkenworthy @BenneHolwerda I wish I'd had that xkcd five years ago when we started our New Horizons KBO search.
@erinleeryan @BenneHolwerda @astrokiwi @astrocrawford @SpitzerScope Hi.
@astrocrawford @astrokiwi @BenneHolwerda WFIRST would clean up. Existing surveys maybe  depends on PSF stability.
@astrokiwi @BenneHolwerda @astrocrawford ... in data not specifically designed for such a search. #GalacticPlane #GalacticPain
@astrokiwi @BenneHolwerda @astrocrawford I can also tell you that if something is hiding in the galactic plane it will be a pain to find...
@lukedones @sondy @HiCommander @arielwaldman There's a paper by [redacted] on that in review!
@arielwaldman @MorganRehnberg @sondy Sigh.
@arielwaldman Yes please.
@arielwaldman You too  huh?
@lukedones But 25 panels is ok  right? https://t.co/Yi8T8Hvlgc
@AstroCook I adopted the man-bun more often when my hair was longer. @CarlyHowett is keen on me trying a mullet.
@MarsRoverUH San Antonio!
@sondy It doesn't bother me in the least  but does provide an interesting window into local expectations.
@Jillian_Scudder @OtherOrbScience @spacejammie @sondy Whereas my data is mostly planets (with definite galaxy contamination).
@Jillian_Scudder @OtherOrbScience @spacejammie Something something CRISPR something...
@spacejammie @OtherOrbScience It is hard  but not impossible. However  it is also a bit thankless [see two-way firewall above].
@ScottWx_TWN It's roughly even between the two.
@BadPhysics Cassowary side-eye is remarkably direct.
@jegpeek @dalcantonJD @davidwhogg @astronomeara @exoplaneteer Delicate? You mean you don't aeropress like: https://t.co/kAHW19EC4b
@dalcantonJD @davidwhogg @astronomeara @exoplaneteer Can control brew time much better and the bloom ends up on bottom.
@Roy_Astro We really had to planet.
@BadPhysics If said with sufficient dramatic emphasis  "IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE."
@BadPhysics @sonic It really does.
@GeertHub @mrtommyb @tsboyajian Lovely plumage.
@erinleeryan @brianwolven @gsnarayan 2014 MU69 was a partial outcome of that exercise  so it was worth it.
@erinleeryan @brianwolven @gsnarayan Someday remind me to tell you about hacking multidrizzle for non-sidereal HST observations.
.@erinleeryan @brianwolven @gsnarayan A boat load of data  you say? https://t.co/Chmct5T5Sz
@brianwolven #Probably
@shaka_lulu Aww look at that tiny little agent of entropy.
@OtherOrbScience Mail them a mirror.
@oafgeek @BadPhysics [initiate false vacuum collapse]
@brianwolven @Summer_Ash @arielwaldman @tanyaofmars @redbubble @startorialist I was thinking the same thing.
@arielwaldman @Summer_Ash @tanyaofmars @redbubble @startorialist The phrase "take my money" comes to mind.
@Summer_Ash @arielwaldman @tanyaofmars @redbubble @startorialist I mean honestly they're tempting me.
@lukedones I haven't had a tropical transition since 2012.
@brianwolven @dalcantonJD @mcnees @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Maybe they sit each drink at the eyepiece of a telescope for a bit.
@dalcantonJD @brianwolven @mcnees @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Also various gemstones. Also one infused with a particular poem.
@dalcantonJD @brianwolven @mcnees @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera There's a bar in Boulder serving cocktails "infused with starlight."
@brianwolven @dalcantonJD @mcnees @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Candied crickets? Mealworm meringues?
@brianwolven @dalcantonJD @mcnees @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Challenge accepted.
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Maybe time to switch from wine to this: https://t.co/Pf4YiUrOc3
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera ... at Target this last weekend. PIE CRUST TIME.
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera So no joke I got really excited to find reasonably priced lard...
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Does that make me my own antiparticle? AM I DARK MATTER?
@dalcantonJD @mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Actually ... me too.
@erinleeryan @brianwolven @mcnees @dalcantonJD @emilylurice @Mpyrifera Maybe with a floral ice cream? Like rose? Might be too much...
@brianwolven @Mpyrifera @mcnees @emilylurice @erinleeryan Oh right I forgot it was half sweetened with maple syrup too. Was  you know  ok.
@Mpyrifera @mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan But then  the weekend approacheth.
@Mpyrifera @mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan Which I am now kicking myself for not trying in a float.
@Mpyrifera @mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan I recently acquired an ice cream churn. First batch was a bourbon spice ice cream.
@mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Later attempts with bottled Guinness proved less good.
@mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera I was introduced via (canned) Guinness and Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream.
@emilylurice @brianwolven @mcnees @erinleeryan I have to thank @Mpyrifera for introducing me to these.
@lukedones @brianwolven North Boulder seems nice  but Table Mesa or Louisville are also contenders.
@brianwolven Alex formation mechanisms are a quinary priority of the Decadal Survey.
@brianwolven Oh hey.
@sondy Grump grump grump.
@sondy I don't think anything "must be" anything if you're extrapolating over a factor of 100 in size from an observed population.
@AscendingNode @astrokiwi @asrivkin @ExpanseSyfy @JamesSACorey Maybe we can consider it for New Frontiers 9.
@brianwolven @PlanetDr @elakdawalla Also this one: https://t.co/YAVVnhyZ63
@elakdawalla @PlanetDr Confirmed. https://t.co/cnSRwctHue
@mike_malaska @DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @caitvw Basically  a hiring practice requiring people have an unrealistic dream seems cruel.
@DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @mike_malaska @caitvw ... to get as far as that  but not deal with academia any further beyond it.
@DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @mike_malaska @caitvw So I can see it being perfectly realistic that someone would want...
@DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @mike_malaska @caitvw PD can easily be most research-focused time in a career.
@DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @mike_malaska @caitvw more realistic than dreaming of a lifer position in academia  I think.
@DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @mike_malaska @caitvw I can train someone with eye on academic track or industry track or E/PO track...
@DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @mike_malaska @caitvw ... and then carry on as makes sense to their situation?
@DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @mike_malaska @caitvw How is that any different from denying someone whose dream it is to do a postdoc...

@shannonmstirone @elakdawalla @RachelFeltman Lots of scattered light in these images  due to pointing back toward the Sun... (1/n)
@elakdawalla @AscendingNode Yep. Lots of scattered light to deal with  too.

@dalcantonJD @nhuntwalker Pluto is pretty fun  as it turns out.
@PlanetDr @elakdawalla "Launch was scrubbed on account of adorable."
@elakdawalla @PlanetDr I mean  that was like ... 8 minutes.
@elakdawalla @PlanetDr Bi-elliptic Orbit to Outer Planet Low-Energy Flyby / Low-Orbit Organics Finder.
@PlanetDr @elakdawalla Or maybe a Farscape-style slingshot off Venus' atmosphere out to Saturn?
@lukedones @elakdawalla "Or five easy payments of just ... plus shipping and handling."

@dalcantonJD @astronomolly @startorialist Full disclosure: I've never used their plate-printing-service before  so I can't speak to quality.
@dalcantonJD @astronomolly @startorialist This defaults to the smaller 8.5" plate  but you can select a larger (more expensive one) too.
@dalcantonJD @astronomolly @startorialist Fiiiiine: https://t.co/a45snzlasf
@astronomolly @startorialist @dalcantonJD Come to think of it  I could probably tile all of PHAT onto these plates at full resolution.

@AscendingNode Sofia "Blanc de Blances" was first opened. Aroma: funky apple  asparagus. Moderate bubbles. Sour in cheeks. Mild sweet apple.
@astrojaguar 8" f/6 :)
@MJIBrown @cirquelar Nailed it.

@PlanetDr I'm looking forward to getting more of Snape's backstory.

@lukedones @AscendingNode @SwiftOnSecurity ON. IT.
@lukedones @AscendingNode I was around for three of the 80s.
@shannonmstirone Likewise!
@nadiamdrake @PlanetDr NIX!
@sondy Because reasons  I used to do a ton of work entirely within RAM drives. It was a volatile period in my life.
@sondy Yeah I wasn't that fancy. But I do checkpoint often.
@_hroe @OtherOrbScience I'm a stickler for recognizing and appreciating context. If set of novelty ears signals a good listener  maybe so.
@OtherOrbScience I would fund Eeyore to further investigate the role of thistles in the diet of domesticated equidae.
@OtherOrbScience I really hate reading these proposals.
@starstryder It's probably for the best that I'm not much of a troll.
@lukedones They're sort of reddish brown. Seems plausible.

@Melissandre_L Probably boundaries between convection cells in the ice - like structures you'd see in cream slowly rolling in a mug of tea.
@OtherOrbScience Do you mean keming?
@asrivkin @lukedones @sondy Planet Twitter: From Asteroid Albedos to Zeus on a Zamboni in under three minutes.
@sondy @asrivkin Then you'll want to work in proper elements  and if you want to be really sure you'll fold in WISE albedos+SDSS colors.
@sondy What's your goal - a sample of only high-probability family members  or a sample contains more members but may contain interlopers?

@DrFunkySpoon @lukedones They overlap a lot  which is very helpful.
@DrFunkySpoon @lukedones Implies an age  not assumes. Normalized impactor population to directly-observed KBOs.
@AscendingNode HOW CONVENIENT
@sondy Sounds warmer than the TNO session. *shivers*
@radjanirad That would be @TodLauer :)
@TychoGirl @OtherOrbScience @brianwolven @erinleeryan Unfair to trees.
@TychoGirl @OtherOrbScience @brianwolven @erinleeryan I think this is entirely unfair.
@TychoGirl @OtherOrbScience @brianwolven @erinleeryan So we're clear  I've heard Terroir described like "drinking a boozy Christmas tree."
@OtherOrbScience @TychoGirl @brianwolven While we're on American gins: favorite by far is St George's Terroir.
@upulie Really a fake fluffy bunny for a tail would probably be a more effective adaptation for deinonychus.
@TychoGirl @brianwolven @OtherOrbScience Have you had the Rogue spruce gin?
@upulie Deinonychus with spider tails?
@BadPhysics At least FLICKER could never go wrong.

@michael_w_busch @PlanetDr This is a good call.
@BadPhysics A Schrader valve produces more thrust  but is much much much less reliable.
@thomassturm @AscendingNode No - even Pluto had barely any effect on New Horizons trajectory. Moving too fast  objects too small.

@cosmos4u Great! I could well be completely wrong! It just struck me as looking very similar. Will be interesting to see what experts think.
@mggtTaylor I bet! Presumably it's also possible that some of the features in the CIVA pics could have been altered since 2014?
@TMAC_Taunton That's fab! Thanks @Giles_Adams!
@3Dmattias Excellent! :-)

@aussiastronomer Yes  unless you're doing more serious studies of meteors - I happened to be holding the bins &amp; put them there to take pic.
@DawnSunrise1 That's lovely Dawn - has a great Western/filmic quality to it.
@m_vandenbrouck Oh wow  that's gorgeous. Is it going to be on display sometime soon?
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn  that means a lot! :-)
@larlar1971 Thanks Sarah! :-)

@grb090423 Yeah  and they all appear to be the same spectral type too! :-)
Quick reminder for anyone in the Buckinghamshire area: I'm speaking at @Wycombe_Astro tonight about the aurora. https://t.co/nVGTKh0Dqb
@cosmos4u And there will be some  ahem  who see that view and think: "Hey  that's the map from Battlefield 4!" :-)
@mars_stu Yeah! :-D Will be interesting to see if the decline in solar activity will have any effect on this year's NLCs. Fingers crossed!
@sarahwhittake15 @Wycombe_Astro Looking forward to meeting you all! :-)
@mars_stu Thanks Stuart! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Certainly was! The light on the water was just magical. :)
@mars_stu Sounds fab! Will have a look into that. :-)
@mars_stu Really appreciate that Stuart. This trip was something of a  slightly mad  last-minute decision. Best of luck for tomorrow! :-)
@mars_stu Thanks! That's really kind! Actually I already booked into a campsite not far from Kielder. Hoping to recce it out while there. :)

@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-)
@robinince Really enjoyed latest TIMC Robin. Great to hear @sarahbridle (&amp; of course the always awesome @Tim_O_Brien &amp; @jonculshaw!) :-)
@Leaving_Orbit Thanks! :-)
@hermitme1 Thanks! :-)
@Cosmic_Carol Thanks Carol! :-)
@tomkerss No problem! :-) Image is left-right reversed as you've probably guessed.
@tomkerss That's Arzachel Tom.
@mars_stu Yeah  not bad - I'd say this site was Bortle class 4 maybe. Did a lot of processing on that shot to get rid of nasty LP gradients.
@Victrix75 Wonderful! I love those moments! :-)
@cosmos4u Nice! Had hoped to image this one with high-frame-rate CCD but just before disappearance laptop started installing updates! Grrr.
@DawnSunrise1 Nice one!
@cosmos4u Great video Daniel!
@GrahamBowes Exact timing depends on your location - it's in a few minutes from here in Somerset for example.
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
@AttreeJane Thanks! :-)
@mars_stu Cheers Stuart! :-)
@BeckePhysics Great image! I really like the subtle ejecta markings across Mare Imbrium around this phase  which you've caught very nicely.
@BeckePhysics Ha! Thanks - it's a bit hit and miss but you get a few frames with the station in them eventually. :-)
@unknownsymmetry Fantastic shot Charles! Nice one! :-)
@blobrana Thanks! :-)
This @BBCStargazing episode is fab. Great insight into the hairy Soyuz docking from @Cmdr_Hadfield who interpreted display panel 'live'.
@mars_stu 'fraid so! I reckon we've got about a week before it becomes a real problem though.
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! I was certainly lucky - whole sky cloudy save for a small patch close to the western horizon where the Moon was.
@mars_stu @skyatnightmag Thanks Stuart! Really kind of you to say. So pleased you enjoyed it. :-)
@tomkerss Boooo! Hopefully catch up another time!
@Avertedvision @chrislintott @chrisenorth @Dr_Lucie @FitzsimmonsAlan Ha! Good times! :-D
My latest @SkyatNightMag piece looks at @twinkle_mission  @NASA_TESS &amp; the next generation of exoplanet observers. https://t.co/N4P8mYxZph
@_TheGeoff That will be little consolation to me when I'm on a Poppins-esque flight across the fields clutching my tripod for dear life! :-D
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 @Solarsphere2016 @Dr_Lucie See you there! If this year's event is anything to go by it'll be a fantastic festival. :)
@chrisenorth Egg-win Hubble  Yolk-hannes Kepler  Alfred Fowl-er? :)
@tedstryk Thanks Ted! :-)
@mars_stu Cheers Stuart! :-)
@unknownsymmetry Thanks Charles! :-D
@AstroExeter Cheers John! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-D
In November's @SkyatNightMag (out tomorrow) I talk to the @ESA_Rosetta team about what we've learnt about 67P so far. http://t.co/nPLvTZL8iA
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
@mars_stu @skyatnightmag Thanks Stuart! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Yeah  I tried to do some Periscope streaming from the observatory but didn't have a stable enough phone signal.
@larlar1971 Thanks Sarah! Have a great weekend! :-)
September's a great time to observe Cygnus. In the new @SkyatNightMag I explore the science behind the constellation. http://t.co/RUidLWMcvq
@DawnSunrise1 Oh yes! :-) Though the northern horizon does suffer from light pollution from South Wales.
@suthers @ESA_Rosetta Yep  that animation of the rotating nucleus is incredible! *Bounces up &amp; down waiting for imminent ESA release* :-)
I’ll be popping on to @SkyNews in about 20 minutes to discuss last night’s Perseid meteor shower peak. Hope you all managed to spot a few!
@SHasani61 Thanks Susanne! :-)
@larlar1971 Thanks Sarah! :-)
@HyperbolicX @SkyandTelescope Thanks! Pending your acquisition of a rocket ship there's always NASA's SDO: http://t.co/QyrIwhOFLH :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Fab shot! I love the colours!
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
@mggtTaylor That'd be great! We'd love to have you on again. Yeah  you too.
@mggtTaylor Thanks so much for coming on the show this morning Matt. Was great to chat with you. Good luck for the next few weeks! :-)
Plus we'll speak live to @ESA_Rosetta project scientist @mggtTaylor about what the mission has told us so far. http://t.co/pkgWYMhmhq (2/2)
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
@FailedProtostar Cheers Andrew! :-)
@unknownsymmetry Oh yes! :-)
@unknownsymmetry Thanks Charles! I reached my viewing point on the top of the Quantocks at ~3:30BST then watched the show for about 30mins.
@cosmos4u Could be good. Good signals on (earlier) VHF radar too: https://t.co/Y3pOdn1xUd
@blobrana Thanks! :-)
@david_hurn Yeah  it's a cool effect isn't it. Same thing always amazes me during meteor showers.
Excited to be hosting @Slooh’s live @AsteroidDay show later. Our special guest will be astronaut Richard Garriott! http://t.co/QjYxBUx2Tk
@FailedProtostar Cheers Andrew! Hope you got some clear skies!
@AlfrescoDB I was using a DSLR attached to a small refractor - both mounted on an equatorial tracking mount.
Here's a brief NASA video about how and why @SOFIAtelescope will observe the Pluto occultation later today: https://t.co/euYiZgsdyD
.@SOFIAtelescope is in the air preparing to study today’s occultation by Pluto. Observing info here if you’re in NZ: http://t.co/ByquRWHRX3
@mars_stu Thanks Stuart! Great to see you today.
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
@bbcweather Thanks! Sure  I'd be delighted. Can you email me via the email address at http://t.co/j3gZDP0Vum to arrange a licence please.
@DavidBflower @blobrana Ha! :-)
@Miss_Space_Geek Thanks Jenny! :-)
@SungrazerComets Thanks Karl! Mostly luck  really  that I didn't pack my scope away from earlier in the day! :-)
@mars_stu Isn't it just! I just finished imaging the flare &amp; then got the @aurorawatchuk red alert notification. Could be a long night! :-D
@DawnSunrise1 Great shot! I like your occulting disk! :-)
@jen_gupta Ha! :-)
@SkyandTelescope And many sketches by Parsons &amp; his colleagues are on show at Birr Castle. Well worth a visit! https://t.co/33zbdqRvct
@mikemenssen @SungrazerComets That's a comet day (for 67P that's 12.4 hours).
@DavidBflower Yeah  they're wonderful aren't they. Little windows onto the past.
@mars_stu Thanks Stuart. :-)
@nourtra00456201 Thanks! :-)
@mars_stu Yeah quite dark  though this was only a 6-second exposure. I took it last night in the Blackdown Hills here in Somerset.
I have a feature in June’s @SkyatNightMag looking at @NASA_Dawn’s arrival at Ceres &amp; what those white spots could be. http://t.co/AW7tUvAEbc
And here’s @DrStuClark writing about the enduring scientific appeal of noctilucent clouds: http://t.co/V3XtPpEZyC
To prepare us for noctilucent cloud season here are some beautiful words from @mars_stu on the thrill of the chase. https://t.co/mHXuQW8UV7
@unknownsymmetry Oooh  sounds good! Each channel was 2500 frames. Then used best ~200 in the stack.
@unknownsymmetry Yeah  colour image (no luminance channel) made from RGB images captured through filters by a mono CCD.
@AstroExeter Yeah  eventually. It could do with some H-alpha data too I reckon.
@AstroExeter Cheers John. It was a mix of 15x 120 seconds (for the core)  15x 180 seconds &amp; 15x 240 seconds.
@DavidBflower @Slooh Cheers David! If you're out observing while we are on air let us know how you're getting on. Just use #SuperSaturn.
@DavidBflower @Slooh Good luck David! :-)
Those new @NASA_Dawn images also show those long features (cracks?) that we glimpsed in February much more clearly. http://t.co/8Zh2acROm5
Wow! Great new animation from @NASA_Dawn of those intriguing bright spots on Ceres. http://t.co/2zSoI9qffD http://t.co/3BU5Rc0OLk
I’ll be on @SkyNews shortly to talk about this new study looking at possible exo-asteroid debris on a white dwarf: http://t.co/TwjP1uZIII
@unknownsymmetry Excellent! :-)
@roger931 @mickhyde @skyatnightmag Thanks Roger! Really pleased to hear that. Am sure the mag would love to see any images you make! :-)
@david_hurn Yes it appears there's multicellular life on this planet! :-)
@m_vandenbrouck @marekkukula I hope so!
@m_vandenbrouck @marekkukula Looking forward to it! See you both very soon!
That article features @mars_stu  @elakdawalla  @mickhyde &amp; @tedstryk - all worth following for amazing pics &amp; more.
In the May issue of @SkyatNightMag I talk to the enthusiasts creating spectacular images from space mission data. http://t.co/PAPy1xbJur
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
@DavidBflower Yeah they look superb with a white-light solar filter don't they. Lots of interesting faculae &amp; features in the penumbrae.
@DawnSunrise1 Lovely shot Dawn! :-)
@unknownsymmetry Thanks Charles! :-)
@cosmos4u Had a very blurry view of it yesterday as the Sun was setting. Will be interesting to see how it develops. http://t.co/KSQ7eXnPAE
@DawnSunrise1 Wonderful! Yes  you too Dawn! :-)
@FailedProtostar Thanks Andrew! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Lovely shot Dawn! There have been some spectacular cloud formations at sunset lately haven't there.
@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-)
@Astroguyz Thanks David! :-)
@larlar1971 Thanks Sarah! :-)
@DavidBflower I thought the same David! The group has grown noticeably in 24 hours  let's see if it has a sting in its tail! :-)
@KeithMansfield Hey Keith! I think there's only an Apple app at the moment. Android app coming soon apparently.
@DavidBflower Thanks David!
@unknownsymmetry Thanks Charles! Yes  I'm still using my PST and those images were taken with it.
@DawnSunrise1 Beautiful aren't they. They were certainly swaying in the breeze this afternoon! :-)
I’ll be speaking about exoplanets at @WellsMendipAstr’s @BBCStargazing event on Sat. Details @ http://t.co/FC0ni42pB9 http://t.co/gRN7e6C5qf
@DawnSunrise1 Sorry Dawn  I missed this earlier. Fab pics of the eclipse! I love the shot with the thin branches - wonderfully atmospheric!
@manic_dave @skyatnightmag Thanks Dave! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! Yes  very happy - just getting my energy back now from racing around. :-)
@DavidBflower Thanks! No  quite the opposite. We had a fair bit of rain &amp; lots of cloud. The gaps were in all the right places though! :-)
@_TheGeoff Brilliant! :-)
Don't forget folks  the fifth series of @BBCStargazing kicks off tonight at 8pm on BBC Two. http://t.co/vK9yYbQj2A
@DavidBflower Cool. Looking forward to seeing your pics! :-)
@DavidBflower Afternoon! Sort of! :-) All the kit is tested  charged and ready. Now just waiting to see what the weather will do. You?
Just sent the paperwork to the @metoffice to get the clouds switched off next Friday. To be honest  was surprised no one had done it yet!
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! And to you too! Don't think there's any 'official' # per se. Both seem quite popular. I only had room for one! :)
@DavidBflower No problem! :-)
Great views of the @NASA_SLS solid-rocket booster test just now on NASA TV: http://t.co/Ud8uNBDjLv
Folks  be sure to follow ace cameraman @mpg666. He'll be filming the eclipse on 20/3 for @BBCStargazing from a plane flying over the Faroes.
@DavidBflower Thanks David! That's very kind of you. :-)
Thanks to everyone who tuned in to our live show on @NASA_Dawn tonight. If you missed it you can catch it again here: http://t.co/QtsI7WFjWO
@I_C_Ceres @DawnSunrise1 Indeed you are! :-)
Great news that @NASA_Dawn is now orbiting Ceres. We'll speak live with some of the team on our @Slooh show @ 6pm UT. http://t.co/gwyVPaO0qx
Mark your diaries! We’ll have a live @Slooh show on Friday (18:00UT) to celebrate the arrival of @NASA_Dawn at Ceres: http://t.co/gwyVPaO0qx
My piece in March’s @SkyatNightMag looks at @MESSENGER2011 &amp; the revolution in Mercury science that it’s instigated: http://t.co/K7KSnV756t
@Darnell Not yet. Bright patches/spots on planetary bodies are often related to ices of some kind. We'll find out soon as Dawn gets closer!
Brilliant! The @Planck/BICEP2 gravitational-waves-signal-in-the-CMB debate gets the @acapellascience treatment: http://t.co/5QzFFx5ZX2
@suthers @popastro @Dr_Lucie Fab video! Fingers crossed for clear skies! :-)
@Johnimus_Prime @BBCStargazing Thanks! Really kind of you to say! :-) Yeah  Skylon is something I'd love to write about in the future.
@DawnSunrise1 Cheers Dawn! :-)
@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-)
@unknownsymmetry Thanks Charles! :-)
@SungrazerComets Seems to be in ambient mode ATM  but you can see a (modelled) CME heading toward Lovejoy @ 02:08 in https://t.co/RNZnbYZqkH
@SungrazerComets Given Lovejoy’s position  I wonder if 9 Feb event (on Sun’s E limb https://t.co/MOQwCYMAnz) has something to do with it?
@DavidBflower Yep! :)
@fcain Also known as the ‘Nigel Tufnel question’. ;-D
Paul Eccleston from @RAL_Space_STFC says @twinkle_mission's scope will be modified version of RALCam-4 design with a 0.5m mirror. #TwinkleUK
@DawnSunrise1 Great! Do say hello! :-)
Off to #AstroFest later  but first to the @RoyalAstroSoc to hear about a new UK space mission that'll study the atmospheres of exoplanets.
@Adriansweather Thanks! :-)
@FailedProtostar Cheers Andrew! :-)
@ActiveAstro Great shot! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 That's lovely Dawn! You've caught Copernicus' ray ejecta superbly &amp; the wrinkle ridges north of C.Herschel are showing up too.
@NaomiDubois @EpicCosmos Thanks! :-)
@OldCrank That field of view is (very) roughly one degree on the long side.
@OldCrank Thanks! It shows the motion over a period of 23 minutes and 40 seconds.
@cain_rob @Astroguyz @VirtualAstro Thanks! :-)
@DavidBflower Good luck David! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 later from the UK with a small telescope and clear  dark skies.
@DawnSunrise1 Yes  our live coverage of the close approach has ended &amp; the asteroid is now speeding away from Earth. It should be visible...
I’ll be talking to Dermot Murnaghan on @SkyNews shortly about the fly-by of asteroid #2004BL86 and what we can learn from it.
@mortimerzilch Thanks. Yes  GRS didn't appear over the limb until about 7am by which time I'd gone indoors. :-) North is up in these pics.
@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-) This was with the CCD (with a 3x Barlow lens element fitted on its nosepiece) in the focuser of 8-inch SCT.
@FailedProtostar Thanks Andrew! Glad I could help out! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :)
@rjmlaird Thanks Ryan! :-)
@DavidBflower Cheers! Though can't claim any skill on my part  just pure luck! :-)
@metrolinaszabi Thanks! :-)
@FamilyoFlowers @PeoplesAstro @NorwichAS @VirtualAstro @shaunreylec Lovely shot! Nice one! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
Fab wide pics of Comet Lovejoy from @suthers https://t.co/yy7aPrsNrh  @hipydeus https://t.co/CbWKOU3aHQ &amp; @mars_stu https://t.co/BGokaWiLFq
@mars_stu No problem! Yeah  got to see it several times while the Moon was around but only glimpsed it last night due to rain &amp; clouds. You?
@mars_stu You can configure it to update every day if you like.
@mars_stu If you go into the configuration window in Stellarium there’s a plugin that can be switched on to highlight stars with exoplanets.
@DawnSunrise1 Great shot Dawn! You've captured the green colour of the coma very well. :-)
@GrahamBowes Excellent image Graham! The coma is showing up beautifully there.
@numerisphere Thanks Alex! :-)
@DavidBflower Thanks David! That's a section I'm hoping to add more to over the winter! :)
@DawnSunrise1 @angegarrod Ha!
@DavidBflower Great stuff! Don't forget to submit it to Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2015!
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! That's really kind of you to say. I was lucky to get a night of great seeing. A very happy new year to you too!
@FailedProtostar Thanks Andrew! :)
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
@GrahamBowes Cheers Graham! :)
@DavidBflower Thanks David. :-)
@DavidBflower You too David! Hope 2015 brings you clear skies! :-)
@DavidBflower Cheers David! :-)
The resurrected @NASAKepler spacecraft has discovered the first alien world of its K2 mission: http://t.co/1klo4LGh2d http://t.co/jKqENsWm6f
@DavidBflower @Slooh Absolutely! Just hoping the clear forecast we have here holds. Best of luck with the imaging! :-)
Look out for my feature in Dec’s @SkyatNightMag about the astronomers who are giving @NASAKepler a new lease of life: http://t.co/MBWgwdrZzB
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
@PenguinGalaxy IIRC I was talking about the formation of EGGs. Hester et al. from 1996 explains a possible process: http://t.co/3lLZd8tWqJ
@PenguinGalaxy Was that when I talked about M16's EGGs in my Hubble talk? Intro to this paper covers some theories: http://t.co/DllilRwsKV
@PenguinGalaxy It's well worth a visit Alice. Lots of other astronomy &amp; space stuff in the museum too.
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks! :-)
@david_hurn Thanks David. :)
@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-)
If you missed last night’s excellent @BBCStargazing #CometLanding special  here’s the iPlayer link. http://t.co/LAlCbpEeJS #TheSkyatNight
@astronomyblog @TM_Eubanks @LauraKeeney @KeithMansfield @b0yle Liking these suggestions folks! :-)
@DavidBflower Yep. ~2.5 hrs' work in total to calibrate &amp; then mosaic all the panes together in Photoshop Elements before adding colour etc.
@AstroExeter Thanks John. :-) It was an Imaging Source DMK 21AU618.AS.
@numerisphere Thanks Alex. :-)
@DavidBflower sometimes see tiny flashes of light - essentially 'end on' meteors.
@DavidBflower Of course! :-) During a particularly active shower if you point a pair of bins or rich field scope near the radiant you can...
@DavidBflower of weeks so you may see a few more modest fireballs then.
@DavidBflower They are really quite spectacular David. The one in that video was clearly very bright  but the Leonids peak in a couple...
@fedkukso Thanks! :)
@m_vandenbrouck Ha! At least it actually is a moose!
@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-)
@FitzsimmonsAlan Wait  I thought it was 'BBC Alan'?! :-)
@KeithMansfield Thanks Keith! Hope you are well. :-)
@ct_la Thanks! :-)
@b0yle Congratulations Alan!
@TarynKelly7 Thanks! Yes  I did. :-)
@ct_la @CampOther No stickers used here. All carved by hand with a craft scalpel  cocktail stick &amp; spoon. :-)
@DavidBflower I’d certainly love to go climbing there! :-)
@astronomyblog Awesome! Thanks Stuart. :-)
Great moment earlier today when @Philae2014 met the Philae obelisk with some of the @Philae_Ptolemy team. http://t.co/IHiueEEggM
Had great fun at @TheUniverseShow last night. Still time to catch the tour ft. @chrislintott  @PeoplesAstro &amp; others. http://t.co/VA3L0sQOTm
In August I visited @RAL_Space_STFC to see a laser that makes mini supernovae. Full story in Nov’s @SkyatNightMag. http://t.co/ZQIdnTrF66
@grb090423 Cheers! :-)
@astronomyblog Your GitHub rendering of 67P is coming in very handy for a little project I'm working on. Thanks! :) http://t.co/mRol7dzDhM
@mars_stu Was fab to finally meet you Stuart! :-)
MT @NASASunEarth A video of yesterday’s solar flare and a twisted eruption of plasma  as seen by #SDO: http://t.co/RlHi91TFUT
@mars_stu Yeah  it gives a flavour of that  but I should note that was not intention. I'm working on the accurate relative-scale version. :)
@_TheGeoff Ha! Wouldn't the surface have to be silvered too? Anyway  I'm not sure how I feel about making it shinier than it already is! :)
@tweetsoutloud Thanks Bobak! :-D
@GeertHub Thanks Geert! :)
@blobrana Thanks. :) Yeah  I'll probably wait until the January apparition.
@_TheGeoff Or maybe a *really* long selfie stick.
@eatswimbikerun @GrahamBowes Thanks! Yes! Sign me up for the next flight. :-)
@DavidBflower Great shot David! Moon was looking lovely this evening wasn’t it.
@DavidBflower Hi David. Sorry I missed your FF tweets. Thanks so much! :-)
@fcain Thanks Fraser! :-)
Look out for my feature in October's @SkyatNightMag about one of the most exciting @HubbleTelescope projects yet. http://t.co/RAvYv2riQ5
@mars_stu @skyatnightmag Thanks Stuart! That’s very kind of you to say. :-) Was a really interesting project to write about.
@drm317 @skyatnightmag Thanks Daniel! Really pleased you enjoyed it. :-)
@FreelancePhilos Thanks! :)
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :)
@mars_stu Me too. Just been looking at some slides(!) I took on the day. :-)
@AstroEmz @sciencefocus Thanks! Glad you liked it. :-) @mggtTaylor was a great interviewee.
Should be on @SkyNews just after 4:15pm talking about @ESA_Rosetta. My office currently being turned into a studio. http://t.co/mxHYPB84cm
@Nancy_A Thanks Nancy! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! That’s lovely – great sense of depth with the clouds  ISS  stars and distant galaxy.
In Aug's @sciencefocus I look at how Rosetta survived turmoil to become one of the most exciting space missions ever. http://t.co/U3w3OSbcua
In August’s @SkyatNightMag (out Thursday) I explore the science of planetary nebulae  the night sky's glowing ghosts. http://t.co/lifFjuxHtv
@ettorins Thanks!
@gaokerena @cosmos4u This morning? In the northern sky? Quite possibly - there was a good display this morning.
@spaceindnews Thanks! :-)
@mars_stu Thanks. :) It's a single exposure of 1 minute @ ISO1600 (hence the noise)  18mm lens. Tracked by an HEQ5 Pro mount.
@erichand I've been speaking to some of the scientists here about that. Feeling seems to be that it's something to think about certainly.
@ettorins Thanks!
@manic_dave @skyatnightmag Thanks Dave  that's very kind of you. Crazy that it's been 20 yrs isn't it - when will the next one be I wonder!
In July’s @SkyatNightMag (out today) I speak to the astronomers who watched Shoemaker-Levy 9 hit Jupiter 20 yrs ago: http://t.co/NG6tIHFPKu
@_TheGeoff …optics are a bit outside my field though. Maybe one for Les Cowley at http://t.co/0iy8dxiiEw?
@_TheGeoff Strange! My guess is it was a lingering contrail drifting slowly south that appeared curved due to perspective. Atmospheric...
@_TheGeoff Also fogbows don't tend to be that large on the sky.
@_TheGeoff From your directions my initial thought was lunar fogbow (as Moon was in SE)  but diagonal feature in pics looks like contrail.
@_TheGeoff Hmm...what part of the sky was it in? How smooth an arc was it?
@mars_stu We need those 5-day planetary waves to kick in. Had a hint of them here in Somerset about a week ago so...
@DavidBflower Thanks David! Yes  and lots going on in H-alpha too.
The latest projects to be awarded NIAC Program funds include a Titan submarine &amp; a comet ‘hitchhiker'. http://t.co/rPmii8pOpP @sciencefocus
Yep! Definitely visible in the Juliusruh view. MT @cosmos4u Are these #NLCs in the NE German live views at http://t.co/LpttUngkaZ …?
@DavidBflower Cheers David! :-)
@AstroExeter Looking forward to it John! Always enjoy visiting the NLO. :-)
@Dam1enW @DawnSunrise1 Great shot Damien!
@remybergsma Nice one Remy!
@DawnSunrise1 Now's the time to have a go! :-)
@PCDPhotography Thanks! :-)
@mars_stu Cool isn’t it. Love that I have a ‘sibling’ to point to now when I tell people that our Sun spent its infancy in a star cluster.
@_TheGeoff Ha! :D
@Tim_O_Brien Look on the bright side  if it is chilly at least your ice cream won’t melt! :-)
In May’s @SkyatNightMag (out tomorrow) I look at Saturn’s rings &amp; the exciting next phase of @CassiniSaturn’s mission http://t.co/BvFUWwgsqf
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn. That's a lovely image - very atmospheric. :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Excellent! I’ll expect a full observing report! ;-)
@GMTelescope Thank you! :-)
Great to hear @OSIRISREx has got the go-ahead for construction. Very excited about this one. http://t.co/d1CAM22BHC http://t.co/PXkiOJNoj0
@david_hurn Thanks David. Hope you get some steadier skies soon.
@GrahamBowes That's a great shot Graham! I've gotta have a go at trying that! :-)
@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-) Great afocal shot - the dark surface regions stand out nicely and the colour balance is very nice.
@GrahamBowes Thanks. I was lucky to get a few moments of reasonable seeing conditions. Helps that I collimated the scope tonight too. :-)
My latest feature in @SkyatNightMag looks at the NIRSpec &amp; MIRI spectrographs that will fly on @NASAWebbTelescp: http://t.co/AfRu81ntyy
@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-)
@FakeAstropix Thanks! :-)
@david_hurn Thanks David. :-)
@cosmos4u Brilliant! Good luck tonight.
@einionyn Thanks Geraint. :-) IIRC I started shooting at ~21:47UT and all of those images were taken over the following ten minutes or so.
@KarenLMasters @dallascampbell @jodrellbank @Dr_Lucie Thanks Karen. :-) I've put up a gallery of them here: http://t.co/Ynky36n7nA
@cosmos4u Hi Daniel. Yeah  we arrived on station at 59.9°N  4.2°W and then our orbits slowly tracked north to the region of 61.1°N  3.0°W.
@astropixie @skyatnightmag Lovely isn’t it. All the work of the mag’s very talented art editor  Steve Marsh.
In March’s @SkyatNightMag I talk to @SungrazerComets &amp; @einionyn about #ISON &amp; that tantalising post-perihelion show: http://t.co/YiS3oYwoNV
No  I said it takes an *hour* to get your eyes dark adapted for aurora observing. http://t.co/u8mvQ1umnw h/t @DrStuClark
@chgreer @Planck @ESAHerschel Yep: http://t.co/6BjpKbi0kU
Astronomers using @Planck &amp; @ESAHerschel have discovered the most distant *cluster* of galaxies known: http://t.co/kYSwpuxdbB
@PlanetDr @juliasilge @skamille i've had to do that  or hold it the whole time  or attach it *under* the dress (not awkward AT ALL!)

@astrotweeps thank you!  will see what my local library system has.
@astrotweeps very interesting option.  do you recommend any books?
@Astrophiz  d'oh!  i never got back to you about this!  i should have time in october.  sorry for the delay...
@PlaneTalking @AAOastro also see page 18 of this AAO Observer for siding spring report: https://t.co/RjMkhR2wv2 (pdf)
#askAAO happening NOW!   get your astro questions answered @AAOastro  https://t.co/mQYTyOI2eZ
@GruntledChalkie @NASAJPL they claim wind and water over time  but it looks a bit more violent?   not my area of expertise  i'm afraid!
so pretty :) @OSIRISREx in SPACE!!!!! https://t.co/ClQiiuvPV5
the @OSIRISREx mission is to grab a sample of the #asteroid Bennu and BRING IT BACK!  so cool. #ToBennuAndBack

@natecochrane @R_Chirgwin disks are mostly hydrogen &amp; helium - not great building materials!
@natecochrane @R_Chirgwin i lean toward the warped protoplanetary disc of rubble idea myself.  can't wait until we can take images of these!
@natecochrane @R_Chirgwin and it would be unstable during construction - very complicated process i would imagine!
@natecochrane @R_Chirgwin harnessing a star's energy: good idea. dyson sphere? unlikely. where would material come from to build it?
@natecochrane @R_Chirgwin you rang?
@PlanetDr ugh  i know that feeling.  they know you're thinking about them.  💜
head over to @AAOastro now while @drsimmo talks about the new exoplanet. get your questions answered! #askAAO   https://t.co/JEnYwdw7Qe
@devin_cherry @Geodedicated it was the fastest launch from earth.  voyagers were boosted by other planets during travel.

@astronomyblog i read that you were looking for someone who knows the force....
@jen_gupta great to meet you! (finally!)
@astronomyblog my face in the still photo - haha!  reminds me of ida's grimace a little.
@jen_gupta i tried once.  they mostly only laughed at things that werent meant as jokes.  planned jokes - mostly fell flat.  tough business!
@jen_gupta @raspberrysauce @adam_avison oh  i've never seen that one!
@PeterDEdmonds @jen_gupta similar - it's an ergobaby carrier!
@emilylurice @Summer_Ash @startorialist @eblur27 @IFTTT that must be what i'm thinking of...
@Summer_Ash @emilylurice @startorialist see DM
@Summer_Ash @emilylurice @startorialist ah ok.  was any of it accomplished as a hack?
@emilylurice @Summer_Ash did you start @startorialist as a result of a AAS hack?
@DaveKary @claudiascosmos any suggestions?
@JLGalache @PlanetarioMed she was AMAZING!  i can't believe how calm and quiet she stayed on ALL THREE FLIGHTS!  i'm a lucky mama :)

@drarnakarick @sarahkendrew looking forward to seeing what unfolds for you.  good luck!
@astronomyblog :( sending hugs your way.
@vacant3rdman i miss sparkling shiraz!  happy new year!
@astronomyblog pretty sure that's mariah carey (should i hang my head in shame?)
@astronomyblog merry christmas to you too! i certainly wanted white wine in the sun  but stuck to sparkling grape juice :)
@cwmagee thank you.  you too! :)

@cwmagee i dont have to know an AU to use a parsec. was defined long before my time! once defined  its usable anywhere
@cwmagee use the average distance
@cwmagee my point still holds.
@cwmagee defined using tools of earth's revolution around sun  but then useful anywhere since it's just a distance.
@stuartgary good luck with whatever new adventures you find  stuart! we'll miss @ABCstarstuff!
@astronomyblog for me too!

@InvaderXan @JontiHorner @BadAstronomer explains the lack of IR to boot!

@astronomyblog @chrisenorth is the book available yet?
@drspacejunk @LisaFogarty if only we could share smells online (i very rarely think that thought....)
@drspacejunk @LisaFogarty the chemistry kinda scares me (if i'm honest) but i'm ready to give it a go!
.@astronomyblog @drspacejunk @AusAndgie7 yes  i'm often assumed to be male when i use Dr and no first name.  it's infuriating.
@alankerlin @AusAndgie7 YES! change will come from influential men stepping up to their leadership roles (@MatthewColless is good example)
@alankerlin @AusAndgie7 @MatthewColless seniour academics need to pressure each other with higher expectations!

@FimusTauri @bbc5live @wendyzuk @rhod_sharp the light we see is before it falls across event horizon of BH - then information is lost.
@FimusTauri @bbc5live @wendyzuk @rhod_sharp restframe massless
@FimusTauri @bbc5live @wendyzuk @rhod_sharp ...we dont know if the radiation was from a star or which star  etc...
@FimusTauri @bbc5live @wendyzuk @rhod_sharp information loss paradox is about entire object (star maybe) that falls in. if BH evaporates...
@FimusTauri @bbc5live @wendyzuk @rhod_sharp light particles (photons) are massless  so do not contribute to gravitational profile.

@astrofrog @jegpeek this has been my strategy for a while
@cwmagee @TerryEesti no  it's not normal practice.  that's why i was surprised enough to point it out.
@CosmicRami @drspacejunk you mean get pyne to space?
@vacant3rdman le sigh
the infamous @StargazerFred Watson is live on #askAAO for the next hour.  go to @AAOastro with your astro questions and to read his stories!
@vacant3rdman wind is picking up a bit - seeing is at 1.6" up here.  still gorgeous.  good luck!
@vacant3rdman very steady and calm here too - milky way is sinking and the moon isnt up for 5 hours. SUPER dark between MW set and moonrise!
@vacant3rdman do it!  seeing is at 1.3" right now!

@vacant3rdman @AAOastro @drsimmo chappie is around next week  so i'll bring #CAKE in on wed or thurs so he can enjoy too :)
@vacant3rdman @drsimmo we should do a helen plate dedicated to helen woods!
@vacant3rdman @drsimmo those look like isolated Xrays of human body parts.  kinda creepy.
@vacant3rdman i dont have 002 though.  maybe @drsimmo can track that down.  i do have the ANN plate though (see the Observer Feb 2015)
@kevinschawinski yes  it's the WORST. followed by heathrow.
@DoctorZen thank you! it has been a lot of fun working on these stories :)

@StephenSerjeant @AstroKatie @kevinschawinski there is collaboration with H-ATLAS team http://t.co/ykmkvDdIub and Driver et al. 2015
@chrislintott @vrooje @kevinschawinski @AstroKatie @galaxyzoo yeah  that would be an interesting next step.
@kevinschawinski @vrooje @chrislintott @astrokatie sure  but (i think) media here approached scientists about doing a short-term thing here
@chrislintott @kevinschawinski  @AstroKatie not sure about the history or how it got initiated.
@chrislintott @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse @AstroKatie by the time i found out about it  it was too far developed to change much.
@chrislintott @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse GAMA http://t.co/fkWv3kvKGq
@kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse similar  yes  but ABC wanted to do its annual citizen science month project with an aus-based group.

@Mozziebites @DrMaggieHardy @DrEmmaLJohnston @_PHAA_ @iamscicomm date/time  tv/radio program or event or school  topic  link if available
@kejames also  cant expect perfection immediately. we must praise progress or people wont feel encouraged to acknowledge steps taken.
@DrMaggieHardy @DrEmmaLJohnston @Mozziebites @_PHAA_ @iamscicomm a friday arvo chore is to open my file and add week's outreach activities
@kejames @astrokiwi true  my wording could have been better at encompassing the total of what the panel was discussing.
@kejames @astrokiwi they discussed best practices for many different topics: gender  diversity  mental health  harassment  bullying  etc.
@kejames @astrokiwi some panel members were representing orgs who received highest levels of our pleiades awards http://t.co/7HeXMuYoWv
@kejames @astrokiwi yes  karen  you made many quick assumptions and conclusions from very little info in a tweet.
@kejames seeing the community discuss the issue  even among a panel w/out POC  is a ++ thing. maybe organizers tried to diversify it? idk
@kejames i get that  &amp; agree. please understand how small the aus astro community is (500) &amp; how desperately it lacks diversity.
@kejames the panel was at our annual "Women in Astronomy" meeting talking institutional policy. discussion moved into diversity as well.
@kejames and can also say the next step in the process in australia is to improve number of POC  b/c #s so low! none in senior roles (2/2)
@kejames yes  it occurs to people. i did not select the panel  but i thought the discussion was good (1/2)
@kejames @cosmicpinot @Meg_Urry @evil_dr_hopkins @caastro_arc true statement. the discussion is happening: step 1.
.@JontiHorner yes  at the most basic level  language can impede or progress communication. it's hard to give up the comfort of jargon!
@CosmicRami @AstroKatie @astroduff @upulie @drspacejunk @CatherineQ that's awesome!
@sarahkendrew @chrislintott darrencroton oops  meant @PlanetDr in last tweet!

@GeertHub @cosmicpudding @j_t_allen BOOOOOO!!!!!!! 😕
@reneehlozek thanks for sharing your post on fb.  excellent read.  i needed the reminder to sit  stop  and take a deep breath.
@cwmagee @chrislintott @Biggreenbooks mostly good - mainly classics that i kept telling myself i would get around to reading.

@jtotheizzoe woah!   that's crazy.
@_sarahmartell_ @GorillaLibrn yes  but i havent seen any #dityspacenews that i would describe as "sexy"
@scottsmedley @AAOastro i like an "aperture of astronomers" but there is not an official word :)
@Blackprojects @El_Lobo_Rayado @LisaFogarty @SAMI_survey @AAOastro VERY big for this type of data!
@LarryWest42 @El_Lobo_Rayado yes  most likely.
and #MDGal15 is officially opened by @AAOastro director @wjcouch! http://t.co/tpdPpiIq76
@drspacejunk i was shocked and intrigued to see that ad last month! didnt manage to try it though
@Blackprojects cool!  there are theories  but with no way to test.... we cannot verify or disprove!
@DoctorZen thanks!! :)
@pdunwin @elakdawalla @NASA_Dawn you read the article?

@JennyMartin_UQ @OtherSociology @AAOastro yes  that's fine!
@_sarahmartell_ @Arachnology worse than nebulae!
@AAOastro woah - that photo of my face looks huge!   haha!
@dalcantonJD @davidwhogg @jegpeek david malin was one of the first (the first?) to add filtered images together to get color astro photos.
@Blackprojects of course it got a gravity boost from jups! if you look at the trajectory  still pretty direct  no major kink to grab a boost
@AstroHyde YES!   you understand.....

@merrdiff @jradavenport @dalcantonJD Let me/us know if you need any.. gentle correction assistance  Jim :D
@merrdiff ...do emails need to be sent?
@merrdiff Excuse me what now?
@BenneHolwerda Or conferences that say "YOU MUST ATTEND ALL THREE DAYS" or whatever.
@NGC3314 @SARA_Obs It looks like a fortune cookie!
@IBJIYONGI @PlanetDr I mean  I'll take one day of not being the special disaster  don't get me wrong ;)
@PlanetDr @spacejammie things that ought to help somehow do not.
@Mad_Science_Guy I don't know why  but this really reminds me of @TheBloggess
@GattaKat @hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI Yup! @Erikaham won one! I'm too old now :D
@jr_pritchard Always here for Bose Einstein Condensates.
.@DrMRFrancis Context : Overrated.
@PlanetDr hahahhahhaha. I gotta get me in on some of that action.
@PlanetDr @astroprofhoff Not yet. I like to leave things to look forward to.
@merrdiff @johannateske @chgreer I feel like maybe @jegpeek was involved with that? But I think a few summarized would be cool.
@johannateske @chgreer @merrdiff Like  imagine how helpful it would be? We also really should be doing audio versions of the CSWA blog.
@chgreer @johannateske @merrdiff I've also been thinking about how to add mp3's of the abstracts.
@chgreer @johannateske @merrdiff OOOH. I've thought about this too. Let me know if you need help.
@jegpeek pictures? What approach did you go with?
@astronomeara I think it is the only sensible path  honestly.
@vrooje @jegpeek @sarahkendrew WE COULD SCHEME
I really want to go to @jegpeek &amp; @sarahkendrew's super cool sound conference  but I need a shtick.
@scorfano @realscientists and teaching
@scorfano @realscientists service
@Julie_B92 @PlanetDr portably we are supposed to observe stuff ;)
@PlanetDr Can I *heat* the planet? ;&gt;
@PlanetDr My first response to this question is "pop it" which is why it is good I'm not a planetary scientist.
@carylgronwall @JohnDebes website online next week - the two days after June AAS
@GoAstroMo Other options... Larry  Curly  and Moe :D
@GoAstroMo I mean you have three just on faculty  right? Probably they need to just go by middle names ;&gt;
@GoAstroMo I do not think we have one at UW! Columbia was a bit greedy maybe...
@GoAstroMo @thegayYA Right??? Let's talk about the best way to execute but... SO HERE FOR IT.
@JohnDebes I would love a load of senior-ish men make it a "can't miss" place to be in June 2017.
@JohnDebes ;&gt; I'd *love* for men to schedule WiA on the calendars (directly following the Summer AAS in Austin)
@JohnDebes Certainly not on the panel. I'm not even sure where we'd find any that were qualified to speak on the issue.
@noah_anyname Because it is the kind of thing that only works is everyone is in on the joke together. So its helping with humour.
@GoAstroMo Can we do this at WiA? Maybe a panel on "White Men &amp; Science - Strange Bedfellows". https://t.co/juNUetad86
@DrMRFrancis Austin has delicious airport breakfast tacos. This is a solved problem.
@PlanetDr 😂😂😂
@PlanetDr yay  so you can definitely fit in 15 minutes of writing. ;) Where to?
@PlanetDr send me words #merciless
@gravitate_to_me oh no. Oh  I know him. God
@upulie Spectra and gels often look similar (my husband is a biochemist :D)
@PlanetDr I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.
@nhuntwalker Tragic  really. #TurningPoints
@shannonmstirone *hugs* We're going to make it.
@thetrudz Right  he's just making sure he's setting out the flags for his folks to pick up later.
@PlanetDr I think they've both been told to take it down a notch. Also  Anderson Cooper isn't trucking ANY nonsense.
@BenneHolwerda Well  now I've got forms to fill out  and have to talk to the princiapl. So I guess that was inevitable.
@Mad_Science_Guy @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI Racism  homophobia  transphobia  anti-Semitism... Slow to sink  I fear.
@Mad_Science_Guy @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI I mean  even if Trump doesn't win  this has brought a lot of hate in many guises to the surface.
@Mad_Science_Guy @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI I think the question will be - what happens when the election is over?
@Mad_Science_Guy @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI Yeah. Jews - Only white till things get pressed.
@dalcantonJD @PlanetDr I just realized I really appreciated on a telecon today  and wanted them to know
@nhuntwalker @dalcantonJD @caseycourval But their jobs are not "Present this worksheet  today".
@nhuntwalker @dalcantonJD @caseycourval Sure. Teachers can not carry the burden of every student every day.
@dalcantonJD @nhuntwalker gonna have to say - current approach locally appears catastrophically poor
@dalcantonJD @nhuntwalker right. Teachers committed to overheads and worksheets won't magically adapt.
@Mad_Science_Guy @nhuntwalker I wildly disagree.
@nhuntwalker general math literacy is low  teachers panic because it isn't what they are used to  it is poorly explained.
@nhuntwalker nope. It's great. People hate it because they don't understand math. I love it.
@nhuntwalker I don't think you teach to the middle. I think clustering skill groups within a class is crucial.
@nhuntwalker but it is possible  and common core is literally built for it
@astrobellatrix @DanaSchwartzzz *hugs*
@thetrudz He's been elected before  so he at least has to be passable  I guess? He can make sentences. #HighBar
@starstryder Like  did it work last time? I feel like it didn't work last time.
@DrMRFrancis And people are so old that apparently they won't even know it happened. So.
@DrMRFrancis I think its just that the Nobel has decreased in its relevance. It isn't that much money. The way they pick is a disaster.
@KnudJahnke I mean  tradition would have it they wait at least 10 years.
@KnudJahnke Yeah  it seems *pretty* likely people knew before the announcement.
@ZJemptv @AnaMardoll It is weird  but if you don't ruin your children by inflicting a strict gender binary the world gets less confusing.
@sondy Oh right! These are your new toys. YES! OMG  I just drove by White Sands like a week ago. *bounce* So excited.
@sondy We had tupperware to protect antennas on our balloons ;&gt; Where are you fieldtripping with the cool toys?

Some inspirational tweets this morning for @PlanetDr https://t.co/qLXvsnGpID
@thetrudz Another feature @Twitter will never implement - next to the fav button  a taboo buzzer. It would help.
@cfroning @SCTrager @shaka_lulu Your grandchildren better bring them back from their travels for you OR ELSE.
@shaka_lulu @FRANK_OKAY IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY.
@shaka_lulu I'm going a bit Madeline Albright.
@shaka_lulu Well that would be AMAZING. I suddenly find myself hoarding lapel pins.
@shaka_lulu Have you never met Jewish old people? ;&gt; Tchotchkes are a key feature.
@PlanetDr OH MY GOD ME TOO. I keep trying to pick off little jobs and then get pulled into the vortex. At least I'm West Coast.
@PlanetDr I still have not figured out a path to settle the fuck down.
@PlanetDr Oh my god  she is me at every sexist encounter I have ever had.
@_sarahmartell_  I KNOW. Haunted by misogyny of labs past.
@prgrmr42 @CatherineQ @PlanetDr @Summer_Ash Married white ladies fuck up the country every time with our voting. I should know.
@CatherineQ @PlanetDr @Summer_Ash https://t.co/c0kDAZTKpB
@PlanetDr @CatherineQ @Summer_Ash Obviously none of us have ever been in analogous situations.
@PlanetDr @CatherineQ @Summer_Ash the infuriating thing is he's basically making progress because people feel bad she's so competent
@CatherineQ @Summer_Ash @PlanetDr Right. Like  if she performs well  he's victimized  if she stumbles AT ALL  she's underperformed.
@Summer_Ash @PlanetDr I don't think anything about torturing yourself with that will give you that insight.
@PlanetDr @Summer_Ash Like  maybe I'll just watch "Zooptopia" instead.
@callanbentley @seis_matters @jetdillo @geosociety our prof societies need to start acknowledging they are failing in their role as advocate
@callanbentley @seis_matters @jetdillo @geosociety this is inevitable reinforcement of societal norms under guise of compliance

@demitrimuna (I am *fascinated* to see who shows up to sign it  in the end.)
@demitrimuna We've got these sprawling billion dollar projects and huge depts. but act like we're paupers. It is good to call us to account.
@demitrimuna I think a lot of us this comes down to us imagining the field as "underdogs" - and then failing to value work appropriately.
@demitrimuna I was at Python for Astronomers this spring and had a chat with Erik about management/structure stuff moving forward.
@demitrimuna I figured if I was going to sign  the least I could do was proofread it. :&gt;

@thetrudz and you don't have to be afraid of falling to your death from your bed  which seems like a downside.

@sondy the color scheme distracts  but it was clean and pretty comfy
@PeterDEdmonds @kahoakes @AstroKatie @DawnHFoster @GoAstroMo ahhhhhhhhhh. Now it all makes sense.
@hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI Yeah  there are days when you wouldn't even have to give me a shove. I'd do it for the world moving forward.
@hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI Is the way this works we just give Chanda our passports to hold  just in case?
@rhaegal @astrobellatrix awww. I'm sorry this resonated.
@SCTrager @GrumpyKelson @kevinschawinski Isn't it cozy down there  Kelson? ;&gt;
@loonunit @kevinschawinski Accidental death &amp; dismemberment. CLOSE.
@merrdiff It was health/dental/retirement basically.
@merrdiff I had one question  but it turns out the answer was "Shrug  follow your bliss" soooo...
@merrdiff I'm not sure I'd recommend it. Maybe all of us new hires should have a cup of coffee and chat?
@kevinschawinski Funny story: Brazil is based around a clerical error around my last name.
@kevinschawinski Now we are hearing stories of people's death and how they filled out the forms wrong and didn't get money.
@kevinschawinski hahahahaha. NO. Accidental DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT.

@astrokatey No such thing exists.
@astrokatey Yes  was an accidental RT  quickly reversed!
@astrokatey What's the context?
@kejames We already sat with him and watched the leaked video together  explaining what was said and why it was wrong.
@kejames He says "I want to be there the moment a woman clinches the Presidency."
@kejames We are letting our 13-year-old stay up specially for the whole thing.
@NoisyAstronomer @DrMRFrancis No  we haven't.
@stoutde @KarenLMasters That sounds great! Do you have a reference for that?
@astrobellatrix I need data and references (it's for a grant).
@Astro_BL Good question. Fraction of students pursuing science at college? Vaccination rates?

@jegpeek looks awesome!!
@Robotbeat @markmccaughrean @Astro_Adept @Jane_MacArthur the point is engage with *your* agency  don t just tell them s'one else is better.
@Robotbeat @markmccaughrean @Astro_Adept @Jane_MacArthur why does this always devolve into "who is better"?!
@astro_adept @markmccaughrean @jane_macarthur yes I think the real work is with ESA but media attention often more focused on what NASA does
@markmccaughrean @jane_macarthur @esa especially now that ESA have a base in UK. you should volunteer someone Mark!
@adrianprw @jegpeek just fill in the form already! 😀
@markmccaughrean @esa @drpetra thanks for the correction Mark!
@MikeWJZ @cbsbaltimore how long till it quiets down?!
@niais @jegpeek (I had to dictionary shtick)
@niais @jegpeek you have plenty of shtick :-)
@reneehlozek it's *almost* like something somewhere went right!
This looks awesome. #DtU cc @jegpeek https://t.co/t1l4onWZrP
@astrocrawford @nick_nwright @brunomerin the number is higher than I’d have guessed  but not surprised it’s a very significant fraction
@gravitate_to_me 😓big name in instrumentation…
@tcratius @vrooje @mikamckinnon I have no problem with you joining the convo but yeah  I find “gals” quite patronizing.
@tcratius @vrooje @mikamckinnon &amp; many times humanity went to “explore” it didn’t end so well  so these topics are not entirely unrelated.
@tcratius @vrooje @mikamckinnon we “gals” have room in our brains to worry about all those things too!
@benneholwerda that will have to wait. but pure parallels will be available for C1 for any 2-instrument combination.
@benneholwerda OK yes. You may need to wait to Cycle 2 then. @te_pickering
@benneholwerda you’re right that MIRI + NIRCam imaging will be available for C1  plus a few other combos @te_pickering
@benneholwerda you may however need NIRCam pre-imaging for your MOS observations but that’s not a “parallel” @te_pickering
@benneholwerda afaik NIRSpec MOS+ NIRcam coordinated parallel likely to be available for Cycle 2.  @te_pickering
@markmccaughrean wow that's beautiful
@karinavoggel @michelle_lmc and also hat &amp; gloves go a long way in keeping you warm  and can easily be stowed in a waistband
@karinavoggel @michelle_lmc have you got long sleeves you can tie around your waist? or a friendly spectator you can hand clothes too?
@michelle_lmc @karinavoggel I hate being too warm so I’d rather be a bit chilly at the start than too hot later on.
@natadastra @astro_adept for science/research there are also NASA fellowship schemes and places like STScI.
@natadastra @astro_adept yes that’s correct. though NASA also work with contractors &amp; rules may be more flexible there.
@markmccaughrean *cough*JWST*cough*
@astro_adept I’m not actually employed in the US  I work for @esa.
@astro_adept but generally American people are genuinely welcoming and helpful. def a contrast with other countries I’ve lived in.
@astro_adept I have to say moving to the US has been v easy. I am obvsly very privileged with good job &amp; visa  no language issues …
@eteq these talks are recorded at ST right?
@astro_adept and also to create rules to get the number they want.
@astro_adept well I can’t compare; just seems shortsighted to shut the UK off from the huge EU labour market.
@astro_adept @jareelskaj though I’ve never heard of US companies having to report about their numbers of foreign workers
@astro_adept @jareelskaj good Q - not so familiar with the US immigration system. I work for a treaty org so it’s easier for me in US.
@planetdr this is true  though would a reviewer know necessarily? not sure if the info is on the proposal. they may know the PI of course.
@r_d_alexander @Matt_Burleigh @ProfMike_M I would be okay with that!
@ProfMike_M @Matt_Burleigh yes Mayor  Queloz &amp; 3rd would be likely. If at all  that is.
@AstroKatie @michelle_lmc possibly just a systematic error
@govender I'm going to quote you on that 😉
@govender would love to see that talk  having been told recently by senior person that "impact is impossible to measure"
Excellent PhD programs advertising on this months job register https://t.co/m95G7Fd7N6 cc @michealjroberts
@gravitate_to_me I think Avi Loeb has already written a paper about that too
@jen_gupta like the last servicing mission when we all spent a week watching the live feed!
@michealjroberts @vrooje but there are so many people who will never have that opportunity. seriously.
@michealjroberts @vrooje I understand you feel disillusioned  and you're right that there are many problems in our system.
@michealjroberts @vrooje with all due respect  if you have degree in physics in the UK you are incredibly fortunate.
@michealjroberts consider applying for a young grad trainee scheme eg at @esa; @stsci are also recruiting heavily  PhD not always req.
@michealjroberts @vrooje big data has also made astronomy more inclusive for ppl with families  disabilities  less $ etc.
@michealjroberts @vrooje 👋 I'm right here. Building instruments.
@michealjroberts @vrooje and I've certainly lost count of all the rejections I've received over my career.
@michealjroberts @vrooje maybe useful to note that I and many other prof astronomers worked in non-academic jobs for yrs before our PhDs.
@michealjroberts sure open debate but I’m in an important meeting right now; we all have the right not to engage.
@michealjroberts because with a degree in physics/astro you can go into SO MANY careers and the country benefits as a whole.
@michealjroberts … though note I’ve only spent 2 of last 10 yrs working in UK so I’m not the expert (in US now).
@michealjroberts in astro a huge fraction of UK postdocs are funded on EU grants; that is a worry now I think
@michealjroberts astro PhDs can easily (&amp; should) go into non-academic careers  for postdocs gets harder.
@michealjroberts it’s dangerous funding more PhD &amp; postdoc positions if no permanent jobs for them to go to.
@michealjroberts @DrJoVian yes. I'm pretty sure ultimately the govt want return to the economy  not a bigger army of astronomers.
@michealjroberts @DrJoVian @SotonAstrodome astronomy inspires technology  arts  education  beyond getting more ppl into Astro PhDs.
@michealjroberts @DrJoVian @SotonAstrodome the purpose of outreach is much broader than making new astronomers.
@michealjroberts @robertmmassey as a professional scientist  I don’t like the assumption that I will do engagement work “for free”
@michealjroberts @robertmmassey someone is still paying for it - just not the visitors.
@michealjroberts @robertmmassey public engagement  “for free”? are you kidding?
@lachlanmartin @profmike_m @astrokatie yes I find them a bit clunky too but sometimes imposed by management and is at least a neutral term.
@profmike_m @astrokatie @lachlanmartin in project accounting we often use FTEs; “resources” is also useful and not to hard to diff from $.
@astrotweeps also “darm” in Dutch &amp; German means “intestine” which is far more entertaining.
@astrotweeps 👋! hope it’s an exciting event.
ESA Sky will soon include #JWST footprints says @BrunoMerin ! #esajwst16
last talk of #esajwst16 is from @BrunoMerin on ESASky https://t.co/aJ0CVAwVYk - @esa’s new tool for archives &amp; data viz
@vealslab a technique to study the environments around stars - like disks  or planets - by blocking the light from the star itself.
@markmccaughrean thanks Mark :)
@markmccaughrean here's me tweeting my a*** off from an ESA conference  and that's the tweet you reply to? 🙄😉
@sleepypenguin1 you can watch online  the link is here (day 2 today) &gt; https://t.co/sv6ekI3hhR
@jegpeek @desikanarayanan @acooray @benneholwerda @karinsandstrom imagining what a useful phrase “let it go” is in project meetings…
@jegpeek @desikanarayanan @acooray @BenneHolwerda @karinsandstrom would there be trademark issues for that?!
In praise of small astronomy - wise words and/or food for thought from @ProfMike_M https://t.co/1CWaHogfk2
@BrunoMerin do we have a hashtag for this conference? if not  #esajwst16?
@astrobellatrix @drarnakarick @demitrimuna OK thanks wasn't aware of the background
@astrobellatrix but casa for ALMA uses Python no? @drarnakarick @demitrimuna
@drarnakarick @demitrimuna no idea re Keck. I know ESO use python  presume astropy too. not sure what uptake in radio is (apart from ALMA).
@drarnakarick @demitrimuna good point! JWST is a big user.
@markmccaughrean are there any events planned at estec on the 30th?
see you soon @debbie_how @astrocrawford  @HighzHodge @LordGarretson @mattkenworthy @carolune @govender and all at the ESAC #JWST workshop!
@jegpeek it was advertised on the Talks list a few weeks ago but now has its own list. Weds at 1:30 @eteq @mubdirahman
@eteq yes me too thanks to my stupid cough @jegpeek @mubdirahman
@eteq @jegpeek maybe a good topic for one of the new JHU visualization meetings!
@michelle_lmc it was getting better and then got worse again. 😞
@markmccaughrean I will be wearing a sign saying "NOT INFECTIOUS"
@markmccaughrean oh they will know.
@starstryder I take pride in being extra scruffy in business class :)
@eteq @npr247 @astropy @brettmor @dalcantonjd that would be my concern too with that model
@jradavenport @brettmor @nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd  @demitrimuna are sadly a LOT of astro’s whose “community” extends only to their own grp
@demitrimuna @nhuntwalker @jradavenport @dalcantonjd @brettmor of course I agree - just stating concerns with alternative models
@nhuntwalker @demitrimuna @jradavenport @dalcantonjd @brettmor what they see as useful to their people  not broader community [2/2]
@nhuntwalker @demitrimuna @jradavenport @dalcantonjd @brettmor of course. but I’d worry that institutes would only want to support [1/2]
@demitrimuna @jradavenport @nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @brettmor Arxiv is a different kind of service no? v important  but different from code
@jradavenport @nhuntwalker @demitrimuna @dalcantonjd @brettmor if institutions are paying into “membership” they may also want more control
@chrislintott could a UK institute apply for community software  positions via the consolidated grant? @brettmor @demitrimuna
. @demitrimuna wrote a good paper on the problem with community software in astro. read it! &gt;&gt; https://t.co/FY28dOrgMt
@jr_pritchard I feel quite conflicted that this is how we find out about this stuff now (don’t doubt that it’s true though)
@michelle_lmc no push ups required to drive that bad boy.
@astrotweeps that's really interesting. What kind of teaching?
@davidwhogg @dstndstn @michelle_lmc @astrofrog I agree!
@michelle_lmc that is an awesome picture of you!!
@dstndstn @michelle_lmc @astrofrog yes those eye-roll people are just dicks.
@michelle_lmc yes I think it’s hotter where you are at the moment than here! I will try to get in a few km this evening.
@michelle_lmc the weather is definitely getting more pleasant for running. still hot but now cool in the mornings at least.
@michelle_lmc 2+ weeks  slowly getting better now. a nasty South African bug 😠
@michelle_lmc yes it gets a bit silly. I deleted my RK account and everything is connected to each other.
@michelle_lmc (says the one not currently doing ANYTHING due to stupid cough)
@michelle_lmc you’re on Strava? come find me!
@jegpeek @desikanarayanan @benneholwerda @conselice me too!
@astrotweeps @astro_liz it’s A&amp;A
@vrooje @Summer_Ash @emilylurice @jegpeek I agree. If we're naming it after people Leavitt is a good choice.
@janerrigby @te_pickering @astrotweeps yes that would be really useful
@dalcantonjd @astrotweeps saw it demonstrated recently too and it is really impressive!
@_hroe @astro_jje @astronomolly @JohnDebes no excuses you should all apply (not you Molly)
@astrokatey (but in the NIR)
@astrotweeps @astrokatey HARMONI &amp; METIS are both 1st generation E-ELT instruments for your IR IFU needs.
@astrokatey another MUSE!
@astronomolly @PlanetDr yes some pretty great sunsets at the moment https://t.co/ikdvmnc6be
@PlanetDr there are taco trucks? in Baltimore?
@drarnakarick 😮😦😨😱 fingers crossed!
@drarnakarick you're so brave
@astrophysaxist @astrobellatrix that sounds awesome! do come up to @stsci some time?
@michelle_lmc awesome!!
@e_astronomer I didn't care so much that I actually tried to do it :) but yes fun modeling exercise.
@AstroBrigi @drarnakarick @becky1505 soon I hope!!
@michelle_lmc ha love it. glad it's not just me 😀
@astrobellatrix of course! but shouldn’t be taken as a sign that you’re less engaged or competent. and men should have the same option.
@ProfMike_M omg you should hear NBC! Makes BBC sound properly intellectual.
@astraughnomer @astrokatie +1. they should really add a note about that in gender diversity training.
@StellarPlanet @stsci check my timeline
@planetdr @astronomolly he was in the stsci lobby but that was an hour ago now. likely that someone has kidnapped him by now - likely me
@astronomyblog I’m sorry Stu  sending a big hug. Email me any time.
@astronomyblog ??! are you okay?
@te_pickering @brianwolven you'd think after 1 bad crash they'd review the safety provisions...
@SCTrager @JossBlandHawtho @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick my PhD project was part funded by industry and gave me tons of valuable experience
@JossBlandHawtho @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick maybe facilitate movement between academia &amp; industry  in both directions?
@Cosmic_Horizons @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick not unless we drastically reduce the number of postdocs!
@cosmicpinot @drarnakarick @Cosmic_Horizons that would be a *great* improvement for postdocs
@drarnakarick @aagie it does make me glad I went to a girls' school. I think we were slightly more protected from that bias.
@kejames she's Han's sister right?
@drdasb @telescoper @knudjahnke sure but let’s not mix gastronomy with equestrian sport
@knudjahnke @telescoper ew!
@astro_liz @michelle_lmc (and yes I know you 2 were probably still in primary school then 😉)
@astro_liz @michelle_lmc hearing all the news about Rio this week makes me nostalgic for my 2 weeks at the IAU there - 7 years ago!! 😱
@PlanetDr @BaltimorePolice @BmoreCityDOT saw a few cones but they were scattered away
@PlanetDr I just saw a jogger along the water 😳
@PlanetDr it's crazy! So glad I'm not on the road tonight.
@zemogle @megschwamb @dotastronomy @becky1505 @chrislintott yup we know...
@niais @eilatg @carylgronwall yeah at some point we need to move away from acronyms and just name things!
@michelle_lmc Hope the elbow gets better!! I need a 10-hour lie-down now.
Death by push ups at the gym this morning. I dedicated all of them to @michelle_lmc 😀💪
@planetdr @astronomolly yeah I guess some areas are prone to flash flooding. hope it clears soon.
@PlanetDr  @astronomolly  Fells Point! https://t.co/IlMbvzdd1w
@astronomolly @jegpeek it never occurred to me. ha I learnt something new today.
@jegpeek @astronomolly interesting I never considered that some people never see thunderstorms!
@jegpeek I want to give him a hug now
@michealjroberts he's been a terrible leader.
@michealjroberts Smith? At this point there needs to be an effective opposition. But no don't think he'll deliver it either.
@michealjroberts alas having principles doesn't make you an effective leader
@michelle_lmc dinner in the evening but no plans in the daytime! email?
@michelle_lmc LSST meeting in Oxford and a day in London on Sunday.
@astrocrawford @michelle_lmc oh that sounds easy I'm in!
@astrocrawford @michelle_lmc fantastic you guys just need to find a 3rd person for me to cheer on.
@michelle_lmc @astrocrawford but 56 is only a tiny bit further than 42...? I'll do 21 so I can have your beer waiting for you 😀
@astronomolly @jegpeek yes good news!
@michelle_lmc plus I’m sure you can arrange for a few colloquiums so it would totally be a work trip.
@michelle_lmc I’ll check with my people but I think this is meant to be good https://t.co/QoBBBSFLPp
@michelle_lmc though I hear South Africa has some great races (not just Comrades) if you’re looking for a nice destination!
@michelle_lmc not so up to speed in that category - other than some of the famous Alps ones.
@michelle_lmc the HD trail marathon? that would be impressive :-)
@michelle_lmc you’re doing one?? awesome!
@PlanetDr come along some time if you like!
@PlanetDr Hammerman beach - beautiful &amp; safe.
@PlanetDr especially when great swimming is only a half hour uber away! I hope they get some good antibiotics.
@PlanetDr yeah.
@SleepyPenguin1 then I misunderstood - sorry.
@SleepyPenguin1 wasn't meant as a religious expression just concern for colleagues. also calling religious people dumb is really stupid.
@planetdr @astronomolly @laurawatkins_ unfortunately in many places there is zero support for publication charges.
@planetdr @astronomolly @laurawatkins_  yes my experience is generally v good too
@ProfMike_M wow yes - big news and the timing is interesting.
@PlanetDr oh that's the theme? I was impressed at so many space-themed events! Planning a visit tomorrow.
@astronomyblog yes different situations but there are definitely parallels
@astronomyblog for me it's more that any attempt at balanced discussion about science was shouted down by angry anti-EU folks
@sctrager @benneholwerda @knudjahnke ha that’s 2 tweets with the same recommendation - definitely checking them out. thanks Scott!
@jonathansick @benneholwerda @knudjahnke oh thanks - unsolicited input v v welcome!
@benneholwerda @knudjahnke yes my trusty @timbuk2 bag is falling apart and after some research am concluding they are still my fav choice
@knudjahnke well I don’t think carrying my laptop around every day is particularly “fun” but my job requires it.
@knudjahnke am looking for a new laptop bag and is striking across the board that women’s bags: fun/impractical  men’s bags: work/functional
@knudjahnke no no not that. I meant “women all over the world tae their laptops to work” (tho knew that was prob not what you meant)
@knudjahnke all over the world  Knud!
@michelle_lmc she's so amazing
@telescoper @geerthub wave from Brussels! enjoy your stay  Ghent is wonderful!
@astronomyblog @orbitingfrog I know!
@astronomolly @NatureNews bendy mirrors break #threewordthesis
@ProfMike_M @NGC3314 @astronomolly agree entirely!
@ngc3314 @astronomolly @profmike_m + if I have to do an hr of research to understand the point of your proposal  you’re wasting my time.
@ngc3314 @astronomolly @profmike_m well if it’s v poorly written then I can’t judge the science. but I’ve had arguments about this.
@astronomolly @profmike_m don’t assume your reviewers know your exact field. I’m perfectly competent but I do need *some* context! (2/2)
@astronomolly @profmike_m having served on a small TAC though I do think it’s an important lessons for PIs (1/2)
@markmccaughrean @dstndstn @geerthub @benneholwerda fyi early release science with #JWST will have 0 prop.
@vrooje @BenneHolwerda yeah they were just treading water. leadership not credible which becomes a big problem in a big crisis.
Hey @startorialist do you like @astrocrawford and his magic science kilt? Feat. @NoTruerAlien &amp; myself #spiehack https://t.co/JKmz3lBQJL
@spietweets 5 pm I hope!
@spietweets @womeninoptics excellent thanks!
👏 for quick action. hope extended to all @SPIEtweets conferences? https://t.co/hjy6t3vX3w
@michelle_lmc  @eteq "Minnesota Michelle" has quite a nice ring to it no?
@niais @KnudJahnke definitely 😒
sorry mis-tweeted earlier; obviously anyone can go to the @SPIEtweets poster sessions but people with kids have reported being turned away.
@niais @KnudJahnke so not a venue/insurance  thing?
@DrJoVian @markmccaughrean ha ha yes  poor buggers ⚽️😓
@markmccaughrean @DrJoVian well right now we're still in everything!
Construction of housing for crew building @GMTelescope at Las Campanas has begun - they'll have a nice view - McCarthy #SPIEastro
@BenneHolwerda @AstroKatie @mattkenworthy @astrocrawford @upbeatprof only that I'm kind of happier when I'm not on a plane
@ProfMike_M don't leave us Mike!
@michealjroberts well their priority is the human cost of its member states. UK people have chosen out of EU protection.
@michealjroberts I think it was naive of Leavers to ever think otherwise. The EU isn't going to be vindictive but has to maintain unity.
@Nate_Cohn @PlanetDr my feelings exactly
@orbitingfrog @vrooje @aagie @becky1505 sorry to miss you Rob!!
@drarnakarick @kellecruz @chrislintott I think I missed part of this convo but definitely in favour.
@eteq good question &amp; not sure of answer. cc @BrunoMerin !
@teagazer @demitrimuna @ashpags @merrdiff @kellecruz advertise how? we always have examples of non-code hacks whenever we list or present.
@ashpags or what Demitri said (catching up on thread…) @teagazer @merrdiff @demitrimuna @kellecruz
@ashpags turn it round: what would make you want to come? @teagazer @merrdiff @demitrimuna @kellecruz
@mattkenworthy @merrdiff @kellecruz it’s not just coding though - that would reinforce the image even more!
@mattkenworthy @merrdiff @kellecruz oh really?! Do you have any suggestions?
@merrdiff @kellecruz I would def like to hear from people who feel this way about #dotastro to learn how we can do better
@merrdiff @kellecruz hope this is not our image  we always work hard to get a mix of skills  backgrounds and returning vs new #dotastro
@njgoldbaum @kellecruz still working out details so not announcing anything yet but most likely not Europe/N America
@markmccaughrean actual cats &amp; dogs falling out of the sky in UK
@markmccaughrean oh I expect I'll be doing that too 😀
@markmccaughrean and I will be decamping to S Africa for a good part of August to avoid east coast summer
@markmccaughrean I don't entirely disagree with you Mark but today is particularly obnoxious!!
@markmccaughrean @ScienceNelson @MonicaGrady @SpaceKate ha no one told me that in the interview :)
@PlanetDr good luck!
@PlanetDr eep what time is that for?!
@markmccaughrean thanks for the tip Mark! sadly had plans already.
@michelle_lmc impressive collection :) have fun!!
@drarnakarick but I think there are definitely ways of gaining the benefits w/o the downsides eg shared positions  short stints abroad etc
@drarnakarick I'm a bit ambivalent about it as I've gained so much from living in different countries
@michelle_lmc yes I don't see why they can't have the attractive privileges for members' partners but make it gender neutral!
@philipbull @jr_pritchard yes building an international observatory could def qualify as a "global challenge" imo!
@benneholwerda @te_pickering @aallan I’m trying out OneNote which is now free.
@te_pickering @benneholwerda @aallan well it’s been great for many years…..
@benneholwerda @aallan worrying noises about company health.
@aallan I’m trying out OneNote  understand it can import under some OS but not sure about OSX. using both in parallel for now.
@aallan have you been able to migrate easily? and to what? am considering doing the same.
@markmccaughrean great I am arriving just after 11 pm.
@markmccaughrean oh are you coming to Victoria this week?
@PlanetDr @astronomolly hope you packed your sunscreen this morning
@e_astronomer "newly licensed at 35" I guess is interpreted as "omg took her 20 years to pass her driving test?!"
@PlanetDr argh my eyes!
@planetdr weather forecast for next 2 days on the radio this morning was “hellfire and damnation”.  😞
cc @michelle_lmc  https://t.co/nc2WORbiFv
@chrislintott @jegpeek I think ADASS was quite good in that regard last year  to be fair.
@dstndstn @jegpeek @augustmuench @jonathansick don’t know the details TBH  just saw tweets!
@jegpeek @augustmuench @dstndstn @jonathansick note there’s currently an IVOA meeting ongoing. send suggestions that way? #ivoa2016
@planetdr @kat_volk @hauck can you train him (her) to nod in agreement whenever you’re talking?
@planetdr @hauck @kat_volk I would hate to have telecons with video  especially the ones I take from my bed.
@markmccaughrean seriously? east coast weather beats uk weather by 3 orders of magnitude. Just not today.
@astronomolly @laurawatkins_ @biphenyl oh so you need to buy the domain  not the actual hosting?
@astronomolly @biphenyl https://t.co/bLw9a1B9r7
@astronomolly @biphenyl ok. for my own domain I use laughing squid  they are not the cheapest but good ethos and decent support.
@planetdr yes not a good day to be on a bike at 6 am.
. @SenatorBarb does give good science banter - good speech :-) https://t.co/1Zu8ytRT6f
@cosmos4u @mpoessel there are many simple wordings that would convey the more international nature of the mission better
@markmccaughrean well exactly.
@markmccaughrean oh wait you’re right! I was so pleased to see even a *mention* of ESA &amp; CSA :-) MIRI is half JPL…
@markmccaughrean that is partly the reason I’m sure but the largest IT company in the world needs to do better.
@markmccaughrean yes I know there are ways around it but it’s 2016 ffs  surely they can fix this?
hey instrumentatlists/coders: have you signed up for the @SPIEtweets #hackday in Edinburgh yet? https://t.co/ln6E25fpQP
@planetdr sure always happy with company! when &amp; where do you normally run? (or email me)
have you signed up yet for the @SPIEtweets #hackday in Edinburgh?! come join us &gt;&gt; https://t.co/TQ6Gu16be1
@markmccaughrean I hear you but it sure is very very comfy.
@markmccaughrean obviously I would like some kind of collaboration between @esa and @rapha on this :-) @jarimakinen
@drarnakarick I can help with runs in/near London and Oxford!  @astrocrawford
astronomers &amp; engineers! if @SPIEtweets Edinburgh is in your calendar  come join us for Hack Day &gt;&gt; https://t.co/P1abjPcUkK
@markmccaughrean F version would be great thanks :-)
@markmccaughrean me! @esa
if you're coming to the @SPIEtweets Astronomical Telescopes in June  join the Hack Day on Thursday! https://t.co/QFvnSwB9Sq
@brendonbrewer that would make sense!
@startorialist  you are amazing. @astro_Liz @CustomShoeShop
@astro_Liz are you allowed to bling them up? Sounds like a good @startorialist challenge!
@startorialist @astronomolly love it! you should market your brand by introducing Startorialist *Days at institutes.
@astronomolly @startorialist oh like "no flip flops" friday :-)
@astronomolly @startorialist they come in in formal wear?!
@astronomolly should we introduce formal Fridays at the institute? @startorialist
@PlanetDr likewise "this is probably politically incorrect but...."
@michelle_lmc but that seems to be the council's argument (from reading the quote on the BBC article)
@michelle_lmc yes exactly. I could understand if it were a for-profit organisation but as it's not it's a stupid decision.
@michelle_lmc I think the idea is they want to charge parkrun the organisation  right?
@markmccaughrean you're still eligible?
@karinavoggel @michelle_lmc even in high-crime cities you can live a pretty normal and relaxed life  as long as you're a little careful
@karinavoggel @michelle_lmc those 2 cities are particularly bad. you'll be fine!
@PlanetDr I haven't seen those yet but good tip to avoid that one.
@astraughnomer that's amazing  congratulations!
@jegpeek argh sorry to miss it! slow drive back from Goddard tonight @astronomolly @willowdower @astronomyontap @faketumlinson
@startorialist yes sorry that's what I meant - thank you my day is MADE :-)
dear god #spacepants @startorialist https://t.co/hpqnbBTOXB
neural network prediction of galaxy morph's using @galaxyzoo data by @sedielem &amp; @kwwillett  (2015) https://t.co/rFsnOnFWpQ cc @jegpeek
@brendonbrewer yes interesting - thanks!
@michelle_lmc good luck and have fun!! will be thinking of you :-)
@michelle_lmc is it this weekend??
@PlanetDr I'm in Bloomberg
@PlanetDr thankfully my own coffee machine should be arriving any day now...
@drjovian @michelle_lmc I've heard this before actually - crazy
@markmccaughrean good to know!
@markmccaughrean I'm going to miss working on ground-based instruments! No trips to Garching for a while...
@astrotweeps I've had people look nervously at me and say "this is not for tweeting".
@markmccaughrean I may need a raise for one of those…
@markmccaughrean I agree but I'm trying to stay alive until the #JWST launch and my employer has posted me to Baltimore.
@mggtTaylor very soon I'm sure 👍
@mggtTaylor excellent! Come visit your friends in Baltimore some time :)
@mggtTaylor what's next Matt?
@albertoconti great picture team!
@jegpeek absolutely  am around
@jegpeek no I'll be back tonight. house move tomorrow!
@albertoconti this morning?! mine was pretty bad too but no booze
and cc @jegpeek for this paper: Sick  the spectroscopic inference crank https://t.co/jOegtuFv1o
@planetdr yes hi I am here :-) thanks for the tip! need ALL the local recommendations.
@planetdr got good hairdresser tips for Baltimore?
@jegpeek @kwwillett 👍 might quote you on that
@brunomerin yikes I have to update my details for this!! @sxsw2016
@astrogrant have to say I got a little distracted by the dogs to listen to what you were saying. was that the point? @astronomolly @eteq
@SleepyPenguin1 I haven't used it actually. I'm not sure many professional astronomers do but does have some great functionality afaik.
@geerthub it's true  it's not far. but also snow and ice in winter.
@kevinschawinski thanks Kevin!
@e_astronomer I use Jekyll and you don't really need to know Ruby for it. only a few commands for installation.
@chris_tibbs @brendonbrewer  thanks!
@geerthub thanks I am recharging my batteries in the homeland for a few days before I fly. 🍟🍺
@sleepypenguin1 thanks!
@michelle_lmc @surreyastro it's a gorgeous night for some observing!
@kevinschawinski yup yup
@kevinschawinski yup!
@astrotweeps it had a honeycomb backing too no?
enjoying Matt's @astrotweeps stories of Roger Angel &amp; Steward mirror labs. fab technology and worth a visit if you have the opportunity.
@davidwhogg @sctrager @melissakness @astrowizicist @jegpeek and I want to hear about all this at a conf at @stsci next year. more soon :-)
@jegpeek I have some moving chaos to deal with here and definitely looking forward to being on the other side of that now :-)
@mad_science_guy @drskyskull #WTFfoodorigins uncle Bob died from eating this shark  maybe if we let it rot for a while it will be ok?
@mad_science_guy or oh look coffee berries in the poo of these cats  bet that will taste good @drskyskull @drskyskull
@megschwamb oooh congrats Meg!
@michelle_lmc mais bien sur! and in astro  all roads lead to Baltimore these days :-)
@michelle_lmc OMG you didn't mention the push ups to me!! that is BIG news! :-)
@merrdiff congrats!!
interesting! RT @jjkavelaars: @astrotweeps like @astrokiwi says. Underfunded data projects is CANFARs speciality.
@startorialist  https://t.co/h2m1HS9Wuv
@te_pickering sure - big overseas move is a difference sort of company than overland move. @astro_liz @benneholwerda @khesser
@te_pickering my quote from them (for much shorter int'l move) was insane. 3x higher than anyone else @astro_liz @benneholwerda @khesser
@pedroperos exactly
@pedroperos but sure  many things wrong with the way the immigration debate is going.
@pedroperos I guess the argument is that people with genuine "need" aren't immigrants  they're asylum seekers.
@niais you have mine! @mathematigal @planetdr @hubbahubble @princsssuprnova @intrplnetsarah @milkysa
@niais there must be an overlap :-) @wikisteff @mathematigal @planetdr @hubbahubble @princsssuprnova @intrplnetsarah @milkysa
@niais we need a Venn diagram of our interests @wikisteff @mathematigal @planetdr @hubbahubble @princsssuprnova @intrplnetsarah @milkysa
This looks interesting cc @govender @astrocrawford  https://t.co/3Z3CWlmQk2
Ah this is excellent news. Congrats @govender and @Astro4Dev! https://t.co/MvftnsHoI4
today I'm giving the seminar at @imperialcollege on my simulations of high-z galaxy observations with E-ELT/HARMONI.
@drarnakarick @becky1505 and well remembered! hope you will join us.
@drarnakarick no way! the Lexa and I have had way too much fun. ditto the ski gear.
@benneholwerda solves the problem right there  no?
@benneholwerda only after filling in the first 10 forms I realised I'd misread a number on my new address. drink *10.
@michelle_lmc high five for winter sun :-)
@astronomolly @dalcantonJD  I read that tweet like you were talking *about* @planetdr :-)
@scorfano @benneholwerda yes that's why provenance is important and there are technical ways to address that. overall still beneficial IMO.
@PlanetDr this is why I delayed my move date till spring. so glad I did!
@markmccaughrean oh that's a good idea. but will the movers allow it pre-packed? transatlantic move  not allowed to pack myself.
@markmccaughrean yup exactly. might try to find one 2nd hand. my bike isn't that expensive but still worried about shipping it.
@markmccaughrean ah thanks! currently investigating best way to get bike across the atlantic safely…
@markmccaughrean of course of course  &amp; they are pretty funny
@markmccaughrean have found cyclists on the road &amp; in races way more patronising and sexist than ever had with running though.
@markmccaughrean most of the derogatory terms are pretty gender-specific but sure  not too bad I suppose.
@markmccaughrean also no better way to Rule 5 by swimming before your ride  getting on your bike wet  and finishing with a run. There.
@markmccaughrean and also  whilst probably funny to insiders  this webpage makes me never want to join a cycling club  ever.
@markmccaughrean also cycling geekery really needs to come up to speed with the fact that women cycle too.
@markmccaughrean funny but they get a bit silly. definitely lost me at #42!
@markmccaughrean ouch! :-/ I still care more about humans than bikes (I know  priorities etc)
@markmccaughrean oh no Mark - hope no damage!!
@vrooje yes of course  forgot about that one! @e_astronomer @authorea
@e_astronomer I think both of those are good options!
@markmccaughrean @demitrimuna I think I'll take it as a win anyway (not work-related)
@aallan @markmccaughrean exploitation of ESA space missions I mean
@aallan @markmccaughrean ... Unless we talk about how EU strengthens our position in ESA  which it does by providing ££ for exploitation
@markmccaughrean @aallan I think we should leave ESA out of it tbh
@markmccaughrean @aallan there are plenty of good things about the EU  we should focus on those.
@markmccaughrean @aallan misinformation about what the EU is is a big reason this referendum is happening in the first place
@markmccaughrean @aallan more about not spreading misinformation. Its not about Europe  its the EU  and ESA is separate from that
@markmccaughrean @aallan that's a bit dangerous though - too many people already think ESA is an EU body
@astronomyblog @jonmbutterworth I think it's a good sign that we're talking about it
@stpkav @e_astronomer @astronomyblog so what happens then? No action?
@e_astronomer @astronomyblog of course sexual harassment is just one of many ways you can abuse power &amp; bully people
@e_astronomer @astronomyblog maybe even require that sort of metric to be publicly available?
@e_astronomer @astronomyblog after reading the Caltech case  looking more closely at # students who don't complete PhDs with a given prof
@jr_pritchard you can probably scrap the "nice" too - depending on the postcode.
@geerthub lovely :-) I know how you feel  landed before dawn this morning too. too bad I'll miss you - catch up soon!
@geerthub you in town for long? think I'm in London on Weds.
@geerthub heard good things about LMNH yes! once it's acceptable time for beer (… 11 am-ish?) I quite like Brewdog.
@geerthub got a preferred area? London's big!
@thomasbasboell @shubclimate for example by M. Banaji: https://t.co/shwcNmvXuv (+ link to new book); A. Greenwald: https://t.co/tiAVb4YXUd
@shubclimate in any case  I think oversimplifying complex issues (in whatever way) is often what leads to polarising a debate.
@shubclimate after all  unconscious bias works on many levels - skin colour  religion  social background  etc.
@shubclimate to us as human beings. not something we are deliberately inflicting on one another.
@shubclimate @thomasbasboell I don't think so  as long as we frame unconscious bias as something that affects ALL of us and is intrinsic …
@shubclimate @thomasbasboell yes there are many good studies. check out Project Implicit at Harvard for example.
@shubclimate @efeprat (also aside: women w/o children fare less well than men too  so is not simply a baby issue).
@shubclimate @thomasbasboell and mitigate where possible. "gender in science" is just one small aspect of that.
@shubclimate @thomasbasboell in ways that perhaps don't lead to the best outcomes for that society as a whole. we have to be aware of that …
@shubclimate @thomasbasboell affects our (everyone's!) decision making in numerous ways that affect  who-does-what in society …
@shubclimate @thomasbasboell certainly and don't think I did that. but unconscious bias (which was mainly talking about) is well evidenced…
@markmccaughrean @alokjha seem to remember Belgium had its own version of Delta plan post-'53 but never completed? (not sure of details tho)
@markmccaughrean @alokjha can't watch video as am working but surely the long-term vision and management is pretty unique?
@drarnakarick good luck Arna! hope good things on the horizon.
@owlice @drarnakarick oh right - yes I spotted that MNRAS allowed software citations  didn't know AAS was so restrictive about that before
@astropixie @astronomyblog seconded Stu  big hug! I quite enjoyed reading this on the subject of insomnia: https://t.co/kYZL4q040g
@drarnakarick not sure. maybe they'll wait for AAS to figure out details  then adopt same policy?
@markmccaughrean not sure  staying conservative with sporting resolutions given the big move. suspect cycling culture in US a bit different.
@markmccaughrean ha it's probably quite low. 20 maybe? my cycling is rubbish!
@highzhodge @michelle_lmc just saw this tweet - trying to imagine Casey's face!! that's pretty shocking; agree it stops being fun v quickly.
@markmccaughrean love screen on the green :-)
@michelle_lmc the problem is that by the time anyone voices discontent  it's v short notice to invite new speakers
@vrooje @BenneHolwerda apparently conda is the way fwd these days
@jr_pritchard @drjovian oh that's a cool graphic. good one for my public talks.
@jr_pritchard @drjovian people who have signed away the next 10 yrs of their life to work on it would prefer you not to discuss this 😕
@jegpeek so. many. zeros.
@markmccaughrean thanks captain! I have 5 night shifts lined up next  starting on New Years Day.
@astraughnomer that is epic!
@markmccaughrean maybe not but the #JWST instruments are getting a lot of action over in Goddard at the moment!
@astraughnomer good choice #Belgium
@markmccaughrean I had to use a lever as my hands failed so am expecting to find it punctured by morning... #fingerscrossed
@markmccaughrean there was no way I could fit a new tire with bare hands in the cold....
@markmccaughrean needed to replace a tube and a tire and gave it a good clean too. Taken weeks to find time to do it  so bored of the bus!
@markmccaughrean it was really unpleasant for sure. lost feeling in hands so had to bring a few jobs inside.
@planetdr sadly I don't work in planetary science  otherwise it would def make more likely to cite you :-)
@benneholwerda the bartender @drannawatts @mattkenworthy @astrocrawford
@MJIBrown @glyndaviesmp don't god your breath. I am an imaginary academic after all! ;)
@chrisenorth @jen_gupta also ~annual trips to family in California kind of put it in perspective.....
@chrisenorth @jen_gupta wow that's dedicated. We've always just done the "deal with it" method. They adjust eventually!
@jen_gupta @BBCBreakfast it's probably fairly similar. I officially have one big kid though. She's still sleeping! 🙀
@jen_gupta it's a reasonable response! ;)
@jen_gupta should I be worried!? ;)
@mollhackabout @jen_gupta awesome! Do you want to share his project? Tweet to @UoPCosmology if so. :)
This is why we do these things and put so much effort in. @jen_gupta :) https://t.co/xFP7NCxkkt
@startorialist they're @TikibooFitness leggings. @SotonAstrodome told me about them I think.
You might catch me on @bbc5live in a few minutes talking about #MeteorShower #meteors #Orionids
@jen_gupta did Holly leave too?
@jen_gupta a change is often a good idea. Its why I occasionally go work in cafes. :)
@jr_pritchard thanks. :)
@jr_pritchard is it still live - can you tweet me the link?
Really hope this isn't another Mars landing failure. Fingers crossed for little Sciaparelli. #exomars @ESA_EDM
@nhuntwalker @dalcantonJD @jradavenport @Life_Affirming something which picked up "I'm having a bad day" (etc) and sent virtual hugs maybe?
@BenneHolwerda sorry retweeted with fixed typo in hashtag
@ScolesSarah @Annie314159 @galaxyzoo hey @NGC3314 do you have comments here?
Think Daily Fashion is going to get s surprise! Although there are @startorialist tweets! https://t.co/dFd4fKobBJ
@astrobellatrix yes. The timescale depends on mass. Should have been a "some" on there. If they form they're variety of masses.
@realscientists are you sure? I though Mary Somerville was the first woman published by @royalsociety
“When Einstein met H.G. Wells” by @StartsWithABang https://t.co/xAeOkLUjjN
@gravitate_to_me @ICGPortsmouth look out for our Dennis Sciama Fellowship advert posted soon. Email me if you're serious! ;)
@startorialist from Gap btw who have lots of stars all over clothes labelled "girls 6-14" (in UK outlet shop at least).
@startorialist second tweet I remembered to add the photo!
At the @portsmouthuni Vice Chancellor Address in beautifully renovated lecture theatre in Park Building. https://t.co/r8B0ETF9rN
@jen_gupta @amattwithers @lecrasc @WinSciCentre @SEPhysics we should photoshop that on @ICGPortsmouth group shot!
@ProfMike_M but is "helpful" actually a good thing? E.g. Why women should stop being so helpful at work https://t.co/L1WdkoSnic
@ProfMike_M vey consistent across subject (except in fine arts).
@astronomyblog I love that you did this. The result makes me sad/frustrated though. :(
@astronomyblog yet again thanks for collecting stats on this. I cannot understand why @MockTheWeek can't manage &gt;1 woman *on same show*.
@gravitate_to_me thanks. :)
@ProfMike_M yuck. Thanks for explaining.
Do you think@we look like geologists? European Night of #volcanos @portsmouthuni https://t.co/WTP630X4JQ
Having a hard time summarizing how awesome @jen_gupta is for astronomy outreach in 250 words.... Still  good problem. :)
@astrotweeps @esa @ESA_Rosetta awesome. Thanks for sharing the pictures. :)
Conversation over breakfast this morning: how amazing it is that Jupiter's Great Red Spot is bigger than Earth. @jen_gupta @amattwithers ;)
@manwhohasitall @jen_gupta we don't mind "gentleman astronomer" either....
@MJIBrown @amelia_fmc  @RossEHart yeah we see a strong trend for that in @galaxyzoo (but also most spirals have 2 arms  and esp if barred)
@MJIBrown but see Hart et al. (2016) where we suggest they do (slightly diff consensus algorithm/redshift bias): https://t.co/rX6EB36Ruu
@MJIBrown intentional mispelling I assume? ;)
@MJIBrown we've also had "I’m not where I wanted to be in the talk  so I will speed up now" BINGO  and public arguing about length...! ;)
Summary of @JossBlandHawtho and @kevinschawinski need to be careful correlating galaxy properties with AGN due to timescales.  #galaxyface16
@BenneHolwerda @astroboy_moreno - I think perhaps Omega-Cen - quenched  then eaten by massive galaxy? Qunched.
@BenneHolwerda @vrooje Amy Moffat was at both....
@jr_pritchard @dunkenj European City of Culture I think.....
@azurichard really need to chat with some expert amateurs (which I am not). I just suggest start with Moon and bright planets :)
@kevinschawinski like #galmorph last week?
@MJIBrown we are very far from done with imaging the local Universe. Clearly! ;)
@kevinschawinski so this is basically saying red discs (spirals) are important - right? Just not saying it that way.....?
@jr_pritchard  - Scott Croom just applied our advice for encouraging questions at #galaxyface2016 (will now take data to see if any effect!)
@caastro_arc could you pick one asap and tweet on both? @JossBlandHawtho @MJIBrown @kevinschawinski (annoying to follow 2)
@kevinschawinski #galaxyface2016 I believe
@azurichard also start with bright planets - Jupiter  and Saturn are my favorites. :)
@azurichard also try looking at the easy targets first - the Moon is amazing first time through a telescope  and changes through the month.
@azurichard recommend you look for a local group of amateur astronomers and/or join online community/subscribe to magazine :)
@JossBlandHawtho @caastro_arc @MJIBrown will add some challenges! ;) #galaxyface2016
@JossBlandHawtho @caastro_arc requested #galaxyface2016 @MJIBrown :)
@MJIBrown #tag ideas for "Changing Faces of Galaxies"?
Good one for @startorialist kids section. :)  https://t.co/YBS9PC90Fg
@AmelieSaintonge @kevinschawinski @JossBlandHawtho actually I don't think that's great  but can't think of better.
@aussiastronomer also to be fair my idea of winter after 8 years in Southern England is not what it was when I lived in Boston! ;)
@aussiastronomer Tasmania though.... in Sept.... looks cold and rainy from the forecast. And leaving from warmest Sept in UK in ~ 100 yrs
@jen_gupta not brilliant timing  but it's worth it. :)
@astronomyblog @ODIHQ I do get around. Result of that project now discussed here: https://t.co/JyjFDSJ8a0 @LandscapeWatch
@robertcnichol thanks - most credit to @astro_hedgehog of course. Hope she is very proud of writing 1st @MaNGASurvey kinematics paper! :)
@aussiastronomer absolutely dr. No question.
It's @Flightsuit_Tim in the @UoPTechnology office! @astro_timpeake :) https://t.co/RhN3VMESs5
@michaelaye @astro_hedgehog @MaNGASurvey all stars move  but some galaxies are dominated by random motions  not coherent rotation
@ICGPortsmouth these ones are from @TikibooFitness (via @SotonAstrodome)  but @startorialist has an entire section of ideas. :)
@jen_gupta that was one of my pay offs for managing to get out early on the seafront. :)
Managed a @startorialist style run this morning along the seafront. :) https://t.co/EJIHZfi8uA
@robertcnichol @chrislintott has proposed jacket linings which would work  but I believe @ShenovaFashion only do dresses/skirts.  :)
@startorialist congratulations. I thought as much in Wisconsin! There's a lot of cute baby space fashion. :)
@DocJuniorST @FakeAstropix @PeterDEdmonds also an example of how easy it is to make unthinking mistakes........ #irony
@astrotweeps sounds like a plan to me. Fwiw I think you've done great this week. :)
@astrotweeps so it's past midnight for you? Sunday morning here. I'm enjoying coffee and news. :)
@astrotweeps where are you right now? Surprised to find you tweeting at this hour!
@747Captain correct!
@AAOastro best wishes for the transition! I remember return to work being rough  but for me so worth it in the end. :)
@oneillleo @astrotweeps will show this poll at the beginning of @PompeyPhysics Computational Physics (plus describe my woeful training!).
Many Qs about why Moon can be seen in daytime yesterday. Nice demo of Jupiter and Venus in daytime. @jen_gupta https://t.co/aX1WcrX4tF
Love this demo of bending of space time made by @PompeyPhysics student Andy @portsmouthuni #purplespacetime https://t.co/djRqxJ9XvC
Great day @VictoriousFest #victoriousfestival talking abt scale and expansion of Universe + gravity w @ICGPortsmouth @jen_gupta @violegp +
@aussiastronomer hang in there. Also write things down. I'd literally be lost if I didn't. ;)
@jen_gupta also "Large" often means very small (it would seem) for women's exercise wear... wonder why. :(
@DrDasB @sdssurveys we can help with that too. We have a bunch @ICGPortsmouth - we'll get you one. :)
@DrDasB @sdssurveys you can have one if you promise to use it only for EPO.
@MJIBrown @SciBry yes. Needs context. :)
@MJIBrown @SciBry I reckon we can find worse if we look a bit. Agree that one is very bad though!
@dallascampbell @NASA_Hubble asked son what it was meant to be and he said "cake". Got to love literal 6 yo mind! ;)
@david_hurn @jen_gupta stickers better to represent gravitationally bound systems (galaxies and galaxy clusters) which don't expand...
@david_hurn @jen_gupta e-foldings will be hard. The stickers fall off if you blow the balloon up too fast! ;)
Every time I see the @TfL Night Tube signs I can't help wishing they were real pictures instead of @FakeAstropix :( https://t.co/gte8beKRn6
I will post a (pre-run!) picture if I like them! ;) @startorialist @SotonAstrodome @MinkJessica
Thanks for the help on space leggings @SotonAstrodome @MinkJessica @startorialist - went for "intergalactic capris": https://t.co/AY7VYw8pmt
@ColemanKrawczyk @coffee_samurai @jen_gupta those are a thing of beauty to behold. :)
@nialldeacon @jen_gupta @Jillian_Scudder or have it delivered to my MIL in California as an Xmas present to myself...?! ;)
@startorialist awesome thanks! We're having an @ICGPortsmouth team at the Great South Run this year  so I need some appropriate wear! ;)
@jen_gupta yes I think VAT is added. I guess i was used to that living in the US - it also happens there (amount depends on state)
Hey @startorialist - are you aware of any astronomically themed running gear (thinking leggings)?
@jen_gupta it's under £135 so I think it's OK. No Custom Duty: https://t.co/XAUmCdXVa0
Love this: Glow-In-The-Dark Constellation Dress @startorialist @jen_gupta  https://t.co/qLQQk8lEcN
Fair return - @jen_gupta gives me cakes too! ;) https://t.co/1hL2Jz4Bw9
@jen_gupta @JohnChinner ha - yeah unless you bring random members of the public with you! ;) Then maybe! ;)
@LibbyJackson__ I always assumed they're the same. US pint different to uk pint though.
@jen_gupta I am going to be on a train back soon. Should be there by 3pm.
@ProfMike_M nice shot.
@MonicaGrady @haykirstin @OUstudents @OpenUniversity @BBCr4today how irritating.
@helen_hm11 thought we walked past you in the street! Have to take my kids home so can't stay for your talk. :(
@jen_gupta thanks I think it was ok  although J said John Milton's was more fun. Kids!
3D printed toys from @WinSciFest #wsf16 @techagekids https://t.co/R6afpDdXjV
Set up to talk about #toysinspace #wsf16 @WinSciFest @Lottie_dolls https://t.co/BnZlK5QL6Z
@jen_gupta @WinSciFest were leaving in 30 mins. Feels wierd to go to Winchester when your in CA!
Was amused to see this in #Portsmouth library advertising 1976 astronomy slide lecture by John Mason. @jen_gupta https://t.co/0LUqBP5I5L
@Historyheroesuk @WinSciFest @Lottie_dolls not that I'm aware of.
About to discuss this news on @BBCr4today Scientists unearth two rocky planets in 'habitable zone' of their star https://t.co/1IWjhnYWYi
Still love that #stargazer @Lottie_dolls went to space. I'm talking abt her and other space toys @WinSciFest friday. https://t.co/aJKSmheR8O
@kyle_carm @starstryder @mickhyde space has billions of stars  but is also very empty. It's just so big!
@mickhyde @ProfMike_M very nice. Thanks for sharing that. So it's not so isolated as it looks at first glance!
@mickhyde @ProfMike_M that's another beautiful image. :)
@drspacejunk thanks for sharing.
@Astro_JohnCF @TrueSciPhi a PhD by definition is original research - e.g cby examining old databases in a new way. As @galaxyzoo showed.
The research output @ICGPortsmouth was in the top 10 across the UK for the REF2014 assessment. @portsmouthuni #SeaCityStudy
Physics @portsmouthuni has 100% student satisfaction in both 2014 and 2015. #SeaCityStudy
We're discussing why to study physics @portsmouthuni - top research + top teaching = why not? #seacitystudy
Ill be working today @portsmouthuni open day  welcoming new prospective astro/physicists.  #SeaCityStudy
It seems that "@astro_timpeake" is here to great @portsmouthuni open day visitors today! https://t.co/MW0kzIwmlK
@MattWest_S4 @jen_gupta gin and tonic with lime. :)
Taking advice from @jen_gupta now my observing done for the night. :) https://t.co/1rBRuBy0v4
@PenguinGalaxy I'm fine. Slightly suffering from information overload!
@PenguinGalaxy @realscientists @galaxyzoo only this week. It's a rotating account.
Just a reminder that this week I'm tweeting from @realscientists at #sdss16.  :)
Join me on @realscientists this week for #sdss16 week.  https://t.co/pKTJnlpmO2
@adnan_a_malik @realscientists @RealSciMods awesome. Thanks.
#stargazer @Lottie_dolls at Yerkes Observatory. https://t.co/VcRB8kIqFB
By the way from tomorrow I'll be tweeting as @realscientists for a week. All #sdss16 tweets will go there. :)
@dallascampbell :)
@dallascampbell @BBCTwo @FryRsquared I'm still catching up  but hope you noticed @guardian mention as best thing on today!
@kevinschawinski thanks. I had tweeted that earlier if you look (and I've told her). Twitter crowd v. concerned to fact check my 9 yo! ;)
Nice that @LibbyJackson__ got a mention in of the #schoolsconfences. We're delighted to be hosting one of them @ICGPortsmouth @portsmouthuni
@mggtTaylor it's quite interesting to hear the perception of 9 yos on world events. I've also been asked which continent we are joining! ;)
@mggtTaylor @NASA @esa that was her perception though Her friends also worried England has to leave #euro2016 if we don't vote #remain!
Now @LibbyJackson__ looking very happy on @BBCNews #congratulations to all at #UKSA #WelcomeHomeTim https://t.co/98cbbhWEF7
Son (6) makes his comments on the current @NASATVLive view from space: "Why is it going so slowly? Which planet is that?"  @AmazingSpace2
@OmanReagan "voids" is used to describe spaces with few galaxies  and filaments or "the cosmic web" for the rest.
@OmanReagan we live in a small collection of galaxies called "The Local Group". We also sometimes refer to the "local Universe".
Fun to wake up to tweets about @kevinschawinski #aas228 @galaxyzoo talk. Thanks @chrislintott @vrooje. :)
It's @BBCStargazing Sky at Night tonight in which @chrislintott and I explore UV and X-ray images of Whirlpool. :)  https://t.co/XEOVLiijem
@kevinschawinski does the age of a tool matter if it functions? Agreed FERENGI could be improved upon however....
.@PenguinGalaxy @galaxyzoo @UoPTechnology in a talk - relevent slides attached. https://t.co/vYwr3ob3uT
Hey @PenguinGalaxy - I just used you @galaxyzoo Limerick (credited) to explain my research @UoPTechnology! ;)
@Lottie_dolls great project. :)
This is obvious when you watch  but I'm so glad @astronomyblog is tracking the numbers. Current #limitone not enough https://t.co/qsM6Sczipg
@astronomyblog tweet the link?
@megschwamb sorry we didn't have time for more than "hello  goodbye" last week. :(
@megschwamb thanks. :)
@robertcnichol @sdssurveys @jajohnson51 thanks for the most Bob like congratulations ever! ;)
Awesome @Wikipedia page "Galaxies in fiction". One to read properly when I have chance: https://t.co/kKyogqLhFT
@davecl42 @jen_gupta @ICGPortsmouth very cool I like the colours. :)
@AstroUDP @jen_gupta @coffee_samurai @ColemanKrawczyk thanks. :)
The @portsmouthuni version of @MaNGASurvey press release from today: hi-lighting contributions from @ICGPortsmouth https://t.co/6oSvBf6FYg
@AstroUDP is the video you just showed available online? I would like to show my colleagues @jen_gupta @coffee_samurai @ColemanKrawczyk
Majewski now talking about the @APOGEEsurvey @NASAKepler collaboration to measure ages of stars in Kepler field. #sharingonesky
@chrisenorth but why the implication we should we be scared of physicists or astrophysicists? That's not a great message....
It's @ICGPortsmouth Director  David Wands with #5. @portsmouthuni #Charityfootball https://t.co/F7nsePnV1O
1-0 to staff already. Hooray! @portsmouthuni #football https://t.co/F1HYMPQ4Hd
First visit to @PompeyFC_News Fratton park today for @portsmouthuni Staff vs Students. @ICGPortsmouth represented by HoD  David Wands. :)
An inside look at what it's like to be a female STEM major https://t.co/TsNEwlFPel via @usatodaycollege
@mpoessel @claudiascosmos @astropixie @zemogle @sarahkendrew @carolune @orbitingfrog happy memories!
@NGC3314 @eddedmondson @hannyvanarkel @KHesser @AMWeijmans coffee! Of course not. It's tea....
It's the @portsmouthuni @ICGPortsmouth @pintofscience being advertised in #guildhallsquare as I walked thru. https://t.co/SRHLFtZ8EY
@eddedmondson @DrMRFrancis with @IamGBT I get one pixel  but a spectrum which resolves the rotation of atomic hydrogen (hopefully)
@eddedmondson @DrMRFrancis  @sdssurveys yes sorry if that was confusing. The @sdssurveys image of a galaxy I'm using @IamGBT to observe.
@chris_tibbs @Caltech @SOFIAtelescope that sound amazing!
@kevinschawinski well we did just have several days of clear weather! Catching rare events is tricky though.
@maricarjagger @jen_gupta @BritishCrafting currently I'm quite well set for star shaped jewellery!
@robertcnichol I'm in London tomorrow too (House of Lords....).
University hosts day of talks on EU | UoP News @portsmouthuni  https://t.co/9CUyyhET28
@robertcnichol @BBCr4today haha yes does seem quite unlikely. Odds of less than 5000-1 I would have said! ;)
@hackenslash1 true - but that's a long time to wait for it to come to us...
@robertcnichol thanks. I'm excited about the opportunity. :)
@jen_gupta @ProfCathHarper how lovely. :)
Tickets now available for the @portsmouthuni @pintofscience events: https://t.co/ieXM1RQpmr with @ICGPortsmouth @LucyNewnham1 and others.
@sondy I'm sure you know you're doing the right thing. I know it's not easy.
@claranellist however statistics also show it's usually (not always) the Dad who earns more  so usually Mum who gives up work....
@claranellist yeah. Not only is it expensive to put children in childcare  it's assumed it's the Mum who will give up job if it's too much.
Interview with Michelle  a Real-Life Rocket Scientist - Shenova @startorialist  https://t.co/dLlwADgNrz
@chrisenorth @vrooje @boomerang @todoist thanks for the additional suggestions. I definitely need some thing. I'm never on top of things!
@jen_gupta hope it went well.
More signs of #spring on the @portsmouthuni campus (near @ICGPortsmouth building). https://t.co/hY6vfhAzKM
@jen_gupta not sure my answer would help  but we can chat later....
Thought this leaflet from @portsmouthuni student services was great. :) https://t.co/gxZYiPtbC4
@astrobellatrix @Independent I was thinking that too!
I learned that @astro_timpeake is doing lots of important science for the UK and Europe while onboard #iss @RoyalAstroSoc
I also think I learned that quasars are very easy to explain  I just don't know how to do it.... @RoyalAstroSoc
Very pleasant day in London @RoyalAstroSoc - now the train home  with snacks a G&amp;T and an episode of @qikipedia courtesy @BBCiPlayer :)
Here it is @astro_timpeake "Peake Chic" for #FridayFashion @startorialist https://t.co/DihhB5uRep https://t.co/HiF92TYTjx
Apparantly there has been a new thing in the UK called @astro_timpeake "Peake Chic" #FridayFashion @startorialist
Kuh: 24 million people in the UK watched @astro_timpeake launch. @RoyalAstroSoc general meeting.
Elvis now talking about "Occam's Quasar". I like it @RoyalAstroSoc
Now in the @RoyalAstroSoc general meeting  with Martin Elvis talking about quasars. #sciencefriday
@PBarmby @chrislintott @e_astronomer to be fair it's hard luck if you aren't near London (not exactly the centre of the country....).
Now hearing abt plans to make superset of @ESAHerschel extragalactic surveys  by Peter Hurley (@PhysicsAtSussex) called "HELP". #rasredshift
@chrislintott @e_astronomer I know. I hope @galaxyzoo volunteers appreciate that we are working hard on understanding galaxy evolution! ;)
Made it to @RoyalAstroSoc just in time for start. Now listening to Richard Ellis explain what we know about high z galaxies. #RASredshift
Made it to @RoyalAstroSoc just in time for start. Now listening to Richard Ellis explain what we know about high redshift galaxies.
Slightly early start today - London for @RoyalAstroSoc meeting. Cheered up by new coffee shop and new dress. :) https://t.co/GyIO31WFf6
@robertcnichol yeah. Interesting isn't it. They claim they may be revealing unknown CMB systematic in the abstract.....
@DawnSunrise1 layers. And comfortable water proof shoes. The weather has been very variable lately.
@PenguinGalaxy awesome. @LucyNewnham1 @jen_gupta here is a galaxy in the shape of an elephant. ;)
@ProfMike_M OK here's the spectrum. Not exactly a thing of beauty (yet - the Sun is up...) but I see no HI there! https://t.co/eiMDs7PLu6
@ProfMike_M yeah I'm cheating as I've looked at the MaNGA emission line map! ;)
@ProfMike_M unfortunately 90s of GPS signal in those last 5mins of data  so have to wait a bit longer (looks like a no though...).
@ProfMike_M we'll find out in a few minutes! ;) Meanwhile back to helping to cook roast dinner. Think this is #WorkLifeBalance
@ProfMike_M @MaNGASurvey yes. HI non-detection as I predicted. :)
@jen_gupta yes I suppose it was. Couldn't think of any other way to actually remember to tell you! ;)
@jen_gupta love that I didn't even have to ask you to do that. Clearly we're in sync! ;)
@jen_gupta @LucyNewnham1 @DrLucyRogers there is actually a galaxy shaped like an elephant. @PenguinGalaxy may know it's name....
@simon_rp84 @TomFeilden actually I did  but I guess I don't remember that. Only gazpacho soup! Sorry.
@simon_rp84 @TomFeilden definitely not a white hole. It's a galaxy. Just a slightly strange looking one.

@bryn00 no  it's being refurbished..they're all in one ginormous open plan office...
@KnudJahnke probably
@KnudJahnke @seanmcarroll it's very  important to keep your latex clean.
@DrDasB You may be right. Let's see how they respond.
@bryn00 Evidently a polymath...
@GeertHub so am I  as long as it's espresso...
@GeertHub it is true the cappuccino is not beard-friendly  but there are other modes of coffee intake. I'm a strictly espresso person.
@GeertHub you need a beard... 😉

@mckinneytweets @Barristerblog Presumably if one tweets something one shouldn't that could be contempt of court?
@mckinneytweets @Barristerblog I've never been in a courtroom so know nothing of the protocols. Interesting!
@Barristerblog @mckinneytweets whom do you ask  the judge?
@Barristerblog @mckinneytweets is it allowed to tweet from a courtroom? Presumably so  but I never knew!
@MawKernewek but many will want to leave..
@laurencepearl @jfcryan I know four more personally  one going at the end of this month.
@MawKernewek @mcnally_bucky @Rachael_Swindon yes  but "1 billion" will be called "2 shillings and sixpence".
@bryn00 it's nice to eat too!
@bryn00 that would have been too obvious!
@e_astronomer perhaps it should be "the lone and level sands stretch Farage's way"?

@GrumpyScientist I can't see it from home...
@e_astronomer they're rubbish unless they have me on the panel.
@bryn00 Now that I didn't know!
@bryn00 Max told me about his son some time ago; Mark used to play for Essex but has moved to Leicestershire.
@barryjbutler @MawKernewek Quite. And I think we're a pariah state already.
@markmccaughrean thanks for letting me know!
@markmccaughrean is anyone doing stuff with the quasars?
@GeertHub They already took over. Didn’t you know?
@gaeleksi sadly  I haven't had any wine. I think that was the problem.
@e_astronomer @TheOKC indeed. Sadly  I think there'll be quite a few more such departures over the next months...
@bryn00 next door to Valentino's..
@bryn00 The Flute and Trumpet was until recently The Promised Land..
@sarahkendrew @stsci @jegpeek no teaching? How dull!
@GeertHub it would attract more interest if it were in Comic Sans..
.@scorrice When Bach is on I listen to Bach. No space in my head for anything else.
@bryn00 I meant the forward version  which I thought stilted and passionless.
@andrewpconnell @Jonesthesteam72 what about those who derive the benefit and then emigrate? Or those who get rich without going to Uni?
@andrewpconnell @Jonesthesteam72 my view is that it benefits public and individual  so both should contribute.
@andrewpconnell @Jonesthesteam72 but you pay tax whether you went to university or not..
@Jonesthesteam72 @andrewpconnell but once at university fee regime was fixed. All those who started on 3k continued at that level.
@e_astronomer I've never been to Thanet. It's nice to have fulfilled one ambition.
@bryn00 so Mahler had three songs disallowed. Were they offside?

@naivebayesian @TeslaMotors whoops!
@Astro_Wright @Robotbeat molecular and solid state processes have effective temperatures way higher than 300K for purposes of Carnot
@Robotbeat and ps. Flares could help
@Robotbeat @chrislintott @SCTrager (a) haven't calc'd; just sayin' (b) fact that PVs work in the IR isn't sufficient (c) no doom implied!
@rdrimmel No! But the usable free energy drops very quickly with the temperature of the host star. Of course the flares could help!
@brendonbrewer I was reluctant to tweet that! The Carnot cycle? Does that ring a bell?
@adrianprw @caprastro @shaka_lulu I was trying to remember what they are called!
@caprastro @shaka_lulu that ensures that the LSST data can't be used to investigate #contrails!

@chgreer @brendonbrewer I plan to go down before the ship

@shaka_lulu you will be missed. @_inundata  you will be drunk.
@GeertHub @GoojajiGreg that is awesome! Does that mean that a larger chunk would  say  wipe out Berlin?

@physicsmatt another great feature!
@hubbahubble @exoplaneteer I know!!
@physicsmatt Just had a thought: it would be SO COOL if past-Rome was on the lightcone. A periodic Universe would be the best thing EVER.
@physicsmatt actually  Rome 3000 yr ago isn't on the light cone  so-strictly speaking-doesn't have a redshift!
@physicsmatt did you mean "was"? I think most Romans are either Catholic or atheist these days!

@GeertHub @aussiastronomer @KeplerBot yes!
@jbocha who do you like after Exaggerator? As you could predict  I like Cherry Wine...
@GeertHub @aussiastronomer bot idea: tweet one @NASAKepler variable-star lightcurve per day  with classification
@aussiastronomer @NASAKepler these are great! What kind of variable was (2)??
@aussiastronomer alien megastructures!  🙂
@brendonbrewer I hope that's true!
@bochowns @jbocha @UNUsays @hope_reese @TechRepublic indeed. Exaggerator will go off at 1:2!
@jbocha @bochowns @UNUsays @hope_reese @TechRepublic those were short odds bets among exotics. The parimutuel odds are also crowdsourced!
@jbocha @bochowns @UNUsays @hope_reese @TechRepublic isn't it a no-brainer?

@KyleCranmer @openscience yes  you are absolutely right there
@KyleCranmer @openscience I only see it as a cost because you have to think about it  and maybe talk to a lawyer

@partialobs @rdrimmel @hubbahubble if possible to re-do searches in full data stream  this is a policy change and I withdraw my criticism!
@jegpeek @jradavenport @rdrimmel @hubbahubble @MAST_News this is great! I take it back re panstarrs
@rdrimmel @hubbahubble the list is known: panstarrs  LIGO  LHC/Atlas  you name it!!
@rdrimmel @hubbahubble we were talking in general  but real q is: assassinate or wait?!
@cloud149 @jegpeek why you are reading this as being about physics? These are all-NSF priorities; most sciences weren't mentioned at all
@jegpeek @willowdower @astronomolly my only point is that a DOI without versioning is worse than useless
@jegpeek @willowdower and that would be bad if we interfaced with @GitHub programmatically; we do with mast: https://t.co/jBSRAOj9uK
@willowdower @jegpeek also  interface changes interfere with development
@jegpeek @willowdower not a reason not to make them accessible! #reproducibility

@lukedones @kellecruz @alexteachey thanks -- useful!
@hubbahubble @kellecruz @alexteachey typical single-system limit at each L-point is a few M_earth? Sounds right. How much does Jupiter have?
@hubbahubble @kellecruz @alexteachey Highly relevant! You don't have a PDF of the poster any more?
@lukedones @kellecruz @alexteachey Awesome! I mean the former... But if there are limits on the latter  I'm impressed!
@duetosymmetry @jegpeek @astronomeara @kellecruz @alexteachey Good point. Do tidal distortions of hot Jupiter (or star) kill Trojan orbits?

@jbprime It's pretty different to be illuminated by an accretion flow than a 5700K star! But great movie treatment

@brendonbrewer @iamdavecampbell absolutely!
@megschwamb @merrdiff thanks!
@merrdiff good question. @megschwamb ? Is there a viewable doc?
@astrokatey @hubbahubble agreed. In the long run public engagement leads to sustainable (and ethically justifiable) funding #aaac
@carylgronwall it's the right thing to do in the ecosystem. I do it too #aaac
@NGC3314 @Astro_Wright @AAS_Policy yes and surveys are being designed
@astronomyblog I just don't want the Facebook like icon albedo-ed onto its face!
@GeertHub without the "(2/2) /cc" your tweet would be funnier (and more awkward).@chrislintott @exoplaneteer @elsisrad @zemogle

@jegpeek @amyekimball oh yes I do!
@rasc @Dunlap_Obs I grew up in that dome. Laser Rock!
@brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer is it non-negative semi-definite to machine precision?
@brendonbrewer I bet it does!
@brendonbrewer @JuliaLanguage looking forward to seeing it
@rdrimmel @mfouesneau @ESAGaia absolutely

@StartsWithABang I mean "you" not "they"!
@StartsWithABang do they compute the carbon footprint?
@brendonbrewer how many of them are bots? I got followed by nine nearly identical users this weekend
@aussiastronomer @Astro_Wright @planethunters @SanchisOjeda yes he was
@brendonbrewer @lessig I'm disenfranchised: The primary is always decided before NY votes  and NY isn't a swing state for the election.

@GeertHub @exoplaneteer @bschoelkopf 3) Well  I think; or that's my intuition.
@GeertHub @exoplaneteer @bschoelkopf @mrtommyb 1) NO  and 2) whoops -- https://t.co/9PhBiOCKAw
@mrtommyb @GeertHub @exoplaneteer That's reasonable -- we also compare to some median filtering  but point taken.

@brendonbrewer great question. Not off hand. Try Tom Loredo. He knows things like that. Cc me!
@merrdiff @StarTrekRewatch @erinbspace I like how the holodeck solves strong AI and to @arfon it's just a computer security bug
@merrdiff @StarTrekRewatch @arfon @erinbspace oh no! Did they tell me that was going to be released publicly?
@KnudJahnke I'm sure you are correct
@michaelwaskom @michaelaye @t3kcit @jakevdp @tacaswell just kidding around! But I love the robustness challenge here
@michaelwaskom @michaelaye @t3kcit @jakevdp @tacaswell (a) I'm sure we can be robust (b) nbins=10 is a choke on EVERY dataset

@brendonbrewer @KaighinMcColl you need to get yourself a HULK and also an explanatory blog post
@nsuntzeff @jegpeek My point is simpler: these three curves are not the least-square-fits to the data at each set of cosmological parameters
@dstndstn I fear @twitter will shut you down @GeertHub
@NGC3314 @1seceu Woah  that is FUCKED.
@jegpeek @nsuntzeff Actually  I think that's a slight over-estimate  b/c the curves were normalized to meet at z=0  not the data pivot
@RobGoldston @jegpeek @ashpags @exoplaneteer That is a terrible use of vodka.
@jegpeek And one of them was Bessel!  Oh yeah!

@hubbahubble @AstroDressing what's the hashtag @exoplaneteer
@ProfMike_M I have often said the same! But of course there's the whole "dollars weigh less in space" thing
@exoplaneteer can you point @brendonbrewer at the mixtures-of-gaussians-in-fourier-space GP paper?
@brendonbrewer this is a decade-length project  not a year-length project.
@brendonbrewer oh and ps you have to run on 70 000 data points fast
@brendonbrewer Yes  it is to make the spectrum model from a stellar model; this requires MANY nuisance parameters  it turns out.
@jbocha your picks by email were good; I hope you cashed. My only hit was an insurance exacta. @AndyChrisCRPC

@brendonbrewer @ruthangus definitely useful! We have a few more experiments to do but then let's get together to chat (by phone)
@GeertHub @exoplaneteer probably not in 140 characters! Lots about inference  sampling  noise  and model-space search; also code+tests+users
@cosmos4u my point wasn't specifically about any culture
@cosmos4u I mean that we do (and ought to) try not to build buildings inside the view of natural wonders  even though many would love to.
@brendonbrewer exactly my point: I am the lazy  you are the non-lazy!!
@brendonbrewer once again  the #lazyweb works for me! Thanks so much.

Hey @planethunters and exoplaneteers: Is there a paper somewhere with a catalog of single transits (ie  P &gt; 4 yr) in @NASAKepler data?
@Astro_Wright YES they are hella coherent.  Typical G star and giant modes are unresolved in 4.1 yrs of @NASAKepler observing

@StartsWithABang ...if conduction dominated  illumination by Sun on skin would feel irrelevant.
@StartsWithABang ...if radiation fully dominated  Sun would seem equally "hot" year round.

@darth Clearly Vulcan  except SHE'S DUMB AS DIRT.
@darth https://t.co/CQz1gRQNXN
@astronomolly @Harcel @groorg1 I have monocular vision and get some depth by scanning focus.
@nhuntwalker @PeterYoachim @jakevdp I'm partial to "ugly code exchange"
@BenneHolwerda Agreed.
@astrobellatrix Yeah  would probably have to include results. Definitely there needs to be a balance to protect interests of both sides.
@DudeDarkmatter @jbprime @bbcluther She is the best character ever.
@merrdiff @emsque Or at least  of one unlucky person in Andy's office...
@astronomeara @davidwhogg "They're all good stars  John."
@astronomeara "They're all good dogs  John."
@aussiastronomer Ouch. And  yup.
@AgolEric @brettmor @ethan_kruse @nhuntwalker 🐏🐏🐏🐏🐏🐏🐁
@SKEEerra @IBJIYONGI @hubbahubble @rbrtjsnhrrs This is my favorite tweet of the week.
@IBJIYONGI @hubbahubble What's "F* that noise" in latin  because you're going to need a motto.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @ethan_kruse "deeta"?
@brettmor @ethan_kruse @nhuntwalker If I'm using it like "the data(sample) is"  singular. If "the data(measurements) are"  plural.
@brettmor @ethan_kruse @nhuntwalker I tend to treat it like "moose".
@Summer_Ash @hubbahubble You are both champion females.
@hubbahubble I've just been watching this a few times a day  as needed. https://t.co/uXZBYZyh4F
@GoAstroMo @niais First week at MIT  all I met were Steves. (To first order)
@mcnees Ain't no party like a wild turkey party.
@mcnees Wild turkeys do not believe in a two party system.
@hubbahubble @aomawa She is BOOFUL AND GOOD!
@mmcknett @merrdiff This. It gets gnarly. Water flowing over  floating bridges. Trees falling over onto cars and houses. No power for days.
@nhuntwalker @united @BrandonEaston FFS.
@mcnees You should go look at @DudeDarkmatter's timeline...
@hubbahubble @PlanetDr Well  there you go.
@PlanetDr @niais But seriously  how do ppl not get that honest gratitude is one of the easiest thing you can do to make your world better?
@PlanetDr @niais THANK BOTH OF YOU! THANK YOU BOOPLEFLOOFS!
@hubbahubble Oooooooooo.
@nhuntwalker @caseycourval @niais Yeah  time/effort is a limited resource. But  my experience is that often no one even starts the work...
@caseycourval @niais @nhuntwalker though  there's often some underlying issue with the disengaged kids as well  just undiagnosed...
@niais @nhuntwalker In comparison to systems with much deeper  but narrower minima  where works great only when perfectly implemented.
@niais @nhuntwalker So  I think many suboptimal choices schools make are the ones with broad local minima. So  if not perfect  still not bad
@niais @nhuntwalker It takes so much sustained support to get lessons from small studies effectively rolled out to entire schools.
@niais @nhuntwalker And in practice  teachers usually don't. (For many reasons that are not "teachers bad")
@niais @nhuntwalker I have seen studies confirming this  BUT  outcome depends -strongly- on getting clusters right.
@eteq @RisaWechsler @vrooje @jbprime @acooray @jr_pritchard # of fac positions is typically independent of grant $. Diff funding streams.
@DudeDarkmatter @astrokatey @jbprime That must have been AWFUL. Jeez.
@PlanetDr &lt;sigh&gt;
@jbprime @RisaWechsler @brant_robertson &lt;thus solving the oversubscription problem&gt;
@DudeDarkmatter @astrokatey @jbprime FFS.
@vrooje @jbprime @acooray @jr_pritchard Fundamental problem is not enough $$.  That said  I still don't think this is the right decision.
@vrooje @jbprime @acooray @jr_pritchard Well  NASA/NSF *are* trying to respond to real concerns about erosion of grant programs.
@vrooje @jbprime @acooray @jr_pritchard For NASA Astrophysics Subcommittee? Highly unlikely.
@jegpeek @lukedones So I guess there's a "If I make it there  I'll make it anywhere" aspect to it. Provided they don't kill anyone first 2/2
@jegpeek @lukedones Pgh has tunnels  multiple vertical planes (roads on bridges and valleys at same x-y coord)  absolutely ZERO grid. (1/2)
@lukedones Pittsburgh's topography is insane. Totally a bonkers place to try self-driving  no matter how good CMU's engineering dept is...
@lukedones That was just horrifying.
@hubbahubble Most people I know who are into it use astrology as a tool for self-examination. And  well  most of us could use more of that.
@AManCalledHwk @nhuntwalker When they showed his backstory though  the whole meaning of that laugh changed for me. Just became pure tragedy.
@nhuntwalker I gotta finish Luke Cage before Flash starts up!
@nhuntwalker Joe West  though. America's dad.
@nhuntwalker I either had some of those outfits or wanted them when I was older...
@nhuntwalker Yup. Also hits a huge vein of nostalgia for me -- the production design nails my childhood.
@nhuntwalker I'm loving the Get Down.
@mcnees ooooooo!
@sondy Tell him Hi!!!!
@sondy It was super interesting!
@nhuntwalker They *claim* it's UW football traffic related  but....
@Jonesthesteam72 Why you kill my buzz  man?
@adrianprw @jegpeek @astronomolly I didn't even try because it would pretty much be "dog  dog  dog  .... dog  ...um....dog"
@dstndstn @jegpeek Like "The sky is pink" is proposing a debate?
@jegpeek @dstndstn When they go low  we go high.
@PlanetDr @dog_rates https://t.co/VKhB8jGX8k
@PlanetDr Tuning in late. We have space whales?
@hubbahubble Home misses you.
@merrdiff @UW I think Seattle does  but not sure about the state as a whole.  I put a question in.
@BenneHolwerda @e_astronomer Yeah  I had to run one recently  and all the discussion was by The Usual Suspects....
@janerrigby @astronomeara  "Mute me!" &lt;HONK&gt; "Mute me!" &lt;HONK&gt; "Two times!!" &lt;HONK&gt;&lt;HONK&gt; "&lt;flushing sounds&gt;"
@janerrigby @astronomeara And their smash hit "Sorry. I was on mute."
@NGC3314 @BenneHolwerda @PBarmby Oh noooooooooo!
@ProfMike_M @e_astronomer You seek your own downfall or Andy's?
@astronomeara We're all so silly. Stoopid brains.
@e_astronomer Ha! Luckily  I am in a department of terrific collaborative people  so this particular worry has never entered my mind!
@lcjohnso @nhuntwalker I don't know! Seems like the best theory so far...
@nhuntwalker A madman who likes to count.
@shaka_lulu @aussiastronomer I WILL BE COUNTING YOUR DONUTS  Walkowicz.
@aussiastronomer @shaka_lulu "These are an inadequate number of donuts! Rescind her PhD!l
@shaka_lulu @aussiastronomer @PlanetDr I'm fretting needlessly about a non-essential craigslist ad. Because that's how civilizations fall.
@aussiastronomer @shaka_lulu But that's too rational  so let's FREAK OUT!!!!
@aussiastronomer @shaka_lulu And you know what  even if you did forget something? It'll -still- be ok! It's amazing.
@shaka_lulu It's so ridiculous. I would never treat anyone else the way I treat myself sometimes.
@shaka_lulu True. But the circle of Things I May Have F'ed up expanded dramatically.
@mcnees And truly  there is little that's rational about it. I know my brain quirks well enough to have anticipated that this would happen.
@mcnees Nah  past chair was a good guy. There's just a lot of balls in the air.
@PlanetDr 👍
@PlanetDr I recognize that it's totally irrational  but the stupid brain wants what it wants....
@PlanetDr But I can never give myself credit for that. Especially not at 3 in the morning. MUST FOCUS ON PERSONAL FAILINGS!!!
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @demitrimuna 1k avg. Would love a sliding scale based on user base. 1k is huge for state colleges...
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @demitrimuna Cash stream for central support  in-kind donations for maintenance.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @demitrimuna Which is why the "multiple paths to subscribing" could work.
@brettmor @nhuntwalker @demitrimuna But maybe can merge with subscription model. You can pay cash  or support local.
@brettmor @nhuntwalker @demitrimuna Good way for students to skill- and resume-build while keeping a foot in both worlds...
@brettmor @demitrimuna That definitely has a 2 birds with one stone appeal. Lots of back end costs on grads (tuition  benefits).
@brettmor @demitrimuna Probably better model is "so cheap people don't think twice" and drastically expand pool. 300 groups with 1K.
@brettmor @demitrimuna But 10k/yr is a lot. That's why depts were more than happy to let IDL costs lapse.
@brettmor @demitrimuna It's probably $150k/yr incl benefits  min. So  2 people is $300k/yr burn rate. 30 donors of 10k would do it.
@brettmor @demitrimuna None of this is insurmountable  though.
@brettmor @demitrimuna I had to jump through crazy hoops to get cloud computing budgeted before it was more widespread.
@brettmor @demitrimuna Meaning  there are huge structural obstacles with new types of costs. "Buying software" is a known category.
@brettmor @demitrimuna It's a possibility. Prob depends on # of digits and whether it can be structured to look "budgetarily recognizable"
@ktcherny @jegpeek @adrianprw @authorea That is some mighty fine viz  Kirill!
@_sarahmartell_ &lt;extra happy to be member of CAASTRO-3D&gt;
@mcnees No ejecting your right eye.
@mcnees   &lt;J. Crew Headquarters&gt;  "Oh sh!t. How are we going to break this to @mcnees?"
@niais @startorialist I would be more worried about jealousy.
@niais Loved this one too! https://t.co/0akkUznryR @startorialist
@astrotweeps Woah!
@ethan_kruse @hubbahubble That title and abstract pretty much covers it  really.
I'm thinking one of my colleagues needs to write a paper titled "Hey Look  Exoplanets!" https://t.co/gMJGlNy8D4 @hubbahubble
@rareflwr41 @astrotweeps I wuv her.
@Alex_Parker @lukedones @niais Amazingly  we ran into a "Pigeon Assassin".  https://t.co/jdkUvsAmB8
@rareflwr41 @astrotweeps Does she flinch if something is wrong? That would be awesome  to have a grammar support dog. She could wear a vest.
@shaka_lulu @lukedones Wait. Whut????
@mcnees Holiday shopping? Handled.
@kejames @Summer_Ash Absolute. Team logo by @Alex_Parker IIRC.
@NovaSilisko @PlanetDr @EllenStofan @ltelkins HAHAHAHAHA
@PlanetDr @EllenStofan @ltelkins See? YOU'RE the best.
@PlanetDr @EllenStofan @ltelkins When I got married  our caterer forbid sangria. "Trust me. Everyone just winds up puking in the bathroom."
@PlanetDr @EllenStofan @ltelkins Oh my!
@lukedones Weather is pretty nice. Does that mean @Alex_Parker is out of town?
@nhuntwalker Such a good article.
@merrdiff They are truly horrifying  being both large and fast.
@mcnees The numbering is all in red  so pretty sure given the tech at the time that those markings are hers.
@mcnees Pretty sure original...
@nhuntwalker Right? It's such great science  and the gold is getting buried!
@lukedones You should grab a spot on my schedule!
@BenneHolwerda @astronomolly HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA.
@vrooje @PenguinGalaxy For the moment  slides are online. Stephen Heard's book on Scientific Writing is also great. https://t.co/9Nv3josojA
@hubbahubble Oh my!!!! Talk about talent along many dimensions!!!
@nbatalha @hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare ...publicly thanked the UW president (the awesome Ana Mari Cauce) for UW's copious tampon dispensers.
@nbatalha @hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare In a lunch of female STEM profs yesterday  a friend (returning from long visit to UCB)....(1/2)
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare @POPSUGARBeauty Oh good gravy.
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare "For a limited time  the McSugarCube"
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare I think there's a whole untapped marketing opportunity here.
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare That's adorable.
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare Toss in little half-n-half containers and kids will imprint like baby birds.
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare My dad was a grad student when I was little  and  40+ yrs out  I remember going to the office because SUGAR CUBES
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare Ha! They always wanted to come in because of Pat Taylor's M&amp;M stash.
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare The only prospie convos I remember well are with a TOTAL BOOGER at Stanford and my future advisor.
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare WHY ARE U SO BOOFUL AND GOOD  SARAH?
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare &lt;sniff&gt;
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare I'm glad it was useful rather than veering into "horribly inappropriate overshare".
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare Every trip is sponsored by a parter who doesn't make me feel like crap for wanting to do my job.
@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare I think about it all the time too. I am grateful every damn day.
@hubbahubble We recite it chapter and verse.
@hubbahubble @BlkGrlMgc @TheBanneker This picture is the best.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @kgarofali I was 16 and inexperienced  but even I knew that was bullsht.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @kgarofali My partner called all arrays things like "RA"  "ra"  "array"  "Ra". (2/2)
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @kgarofali I worked on character recognition in a high school summer program. (1/2)
@hubbahubble @niais @PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI @JedidahIslerPhD @astroprofhoff ...you don't know or aren't listening to black and brown people.
@hubbahubble @niais @PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI @JedidahIslerPhD @astroprofhoff I think if you aren't aware of a crisis....
@hubbahubble @niais @PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI @JedidahIslerPhD @astroprofhoff I was reading the statement  and was "oh  that's not awfu......"
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @jradavenport @codefellows Done!
@nhuntwalker @brettmor Exactly.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor Maybe I'll just have Brett stand around showing off his knuckle tats.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor Part of me wants a 6'x8' poster for my office  but I think swear words on the wall are probably not a Good Choice.
@brettmor @nhuntwalker Please tell me there's a T-Shirt.
@DrMRFrancis @mcnees I've been gobsmacked at how all the CERN results are plotted. Same default  but it's AWFUL.
@NGC3314 Chucked 'em!
@Thomas_Connor @mcnees I can recognize at least 4 different theses in there...
@Thomas_Connor @mcnees So  I just kept layering.
@Thomas_Connor @mcnees My youngest spent an hour plus drawing Halloween stuff  and I never could bring myself to erase it.
@Thomas_Connor @mcnees You mean this white board? https://t.co/06f9qUzW2M
@kejames @serenawilliams I like how the tennis court reflection looks like she's shooting lazer beams from her eyes.
@e_astronomer I think its origins are Pennsylvania Dutch. You pour batter through a funnel into hot oil to make a lacy fried thing.
@shaka_lulu @MillerAdamA So  what are we to do? I DO NOT HAVE A 5 DIMENSIONAL PRINTER
@kejames @CoopSciScoop Might be ideal to have different "modes"  like in Fruit Ninja. #CitSciChat
@mcnees It's not self-promotion as much as laying out the conceptual edifice.
@mcnees Also  frequently one's work is part of a coherent intellectual path  where Paper D legitimately depends on Papers A  B  &amp; C.
@lukedones @jaynebirkby #IwantmyHDST
@nhuntwalker @astronomolly Given how you came out  that's a pretty good starting model!
@nhuntwalker @astronomolly I'm not saying which ones  but the number of these issues I *know* what I'd do because I had to do it...hoooboy
@ethan_kruse @nhuntwalker This will change.
@jradavenport @nhuntwalker And new grad curriculum is *much* leaner as well  with lots of real meat pushed into "electives". I fret a bit.
@jakevdp @nhuntwalker This is adorable.
@nhuntwalker This is why I lean pro-qual. All that "this detracts from my research" talk? Nawl. It is ENABLING your future research  ideally
@nhuntwalker Dust? SUPER BORING. #havewrittentwobigpapersondust
@nhuntwalker Kindof....everything?  Never did spectroscopy  never learned much about stars  never even REMOTELY considered planets.
@nhuntwalker Well  not everyone has your amazing capacity for self-study coupled with wide-ranging interests!
@nhuntwalker Alllllll of this  Nick.
@michelle_lmc @eteq @bigticketdw Worth their accepting it for the gifs alone!!!!!
@michelle_lmc @eteq @bigticketdw Yaaaay!!!! At Lorentz?
Nice result from IFU decomposition from @ProfMike_M - S0 bulges are systematically younger and more metal-rich than their disks #discs2016
@astronomeara Too slow with the camera.
@nhuntwalker Empirically  mainstream white America shows very little history of being swayed by empathy for black people's suffering.
@nhuntwalker Like  "this isn't my experience  so you're paranoid"  as opposed to assuming that rational people are responding to f'd up ish.
@nhuntwalker Sadly  no. I think what mainstream white America tends to do is assume it's an issue with black America's skewed perception.
@nhuntwalker @caseycourval Regardless of nomenclature  it's profoundly f'ed up and wrong.
@nhuntwalker @caseycourval Yeah  well said. It's two fold  I guess. Fear is rational  but long term effects of fear compound &amp; complexify.
@nhuntwalker @caseycourval I just think it's best described as a completely rational assessment of risk.
@nhuntwalker Except  it's not paranoia if someone is actually out to get you...
@shaka_lulu I wouldn't even go to a party there.
@nhuntwalker Who knows! It was just a LITTLE fire.
.@mcnees Me: "Once upon a time  there were two little girls."  5 year old: "And they were eaten by wolves."  Me: "...."
.@mcnees One of my favorite moments with my kids: Long car trip. Kids were maybe 2 and 5ish. Playing "add a line to a story".
@nhuntwalker @howgilb When your "good old days" were racist as f@ck.
@BenneHolwerda I wish  but no. But  3 PHAT bricks worth  all w/ high SFR intensity (cc @mrcbqn)
@mcnees @Wendy_Mc I think you just need to take Cheeks out here for a vacation.
@mcnees @Wendy_Mc Seattle's science center has GOBs of them.
@nhuntwalker Hell  best father period. (Which makes his being a black single parent all the more profound.)
@IBJIYONGI @AlexandraSurcel @niais @mcnees It's hard when you're biased by things like  I dunno  facts.
@IBJIYONGI @niais @mcnees &lt;nods&gt;. I get having the first reaction of wishing it weren't true. But then  you have to own up.
@mcnees @IBJIYONGI @niais Yeah  I think that's maybe hitting the root of why I tend to keep my distance from some performances of allyship.
@IBJIYONGI @niais @mcnees It's why no one thinks they're a rapist.
@IBJIYONGI @niais @mcnees Owning up to one's mistakes can start to shatter the whole structure of our self image.
@IBJIYONGI @niais @mcnees But it's a brittle definition if you can't accept that being a "good person" sometimes means facing up to mistakes
@IBJIYONGI @niais @mcnees We all have a lot invested in seeing ourselves as "good people".
@nhuntwalker @ZachWeiner Having well cared for future adults &amp; keeping skilled labor in the workforce are benefits society should invest in
@nhuntwalker @ZachWeiner The obvious solution no one will enact is that child care should be subsidized.
@nhuntwalker @ZachWeiner It also keeps going to the right  because of finding solutions during the summer!
@EricHaywood @nhuntwalker Genius.
@nhuntwalker @vrooje @niais @IBJIYONGI Also  It wasn't actually lupus.
@nhuntwalker @vrooje @niais @IBJIYONGI During Mystery Illness  doc suggested a lupus screen &amp; I avoided shouting "IT'S NOT LUPUS!"
@nhuntwalker It's the Nick-JD Mutual Appreciation Society! #myselfiegameisthepits https://t.co/D87L8Xcg37
@lukedones Yay?
@mcnees @lukedones Yeah  "Looks of Desire" for baby kangaroo snuggling is pretty much a "dog bites man" headline.
@lukedones Well  I  for one  have a strong desire to snuggle a baby kangaroo.
@nhuntwalker @jradavenport Good point.
@nhuntwalker @jradavenport I'm really curious how different that map of Japanese households looked after WWII internment.
@nhuntwalker @jradavenport Hellooooo 1930's....
@nhuntwalker @jradavenport Did you see these visualizations? Years of (racist) policy and history mapped out....
@BenneHolwerda @dstndstn @davidwhogg No good deed goes unpunished  Volume Infinity.
@nhuntwalker @UWgomap Good to know for the future!
@nhuntwalker Do you think this would have been a good option while being a grad student as well?
@nhuntwalker Community is the BEST.
@kellecruz @alyssaharad @astrokatey @michael_w_busch "Gas lighting" is from a movie. Is there one that would work here?
@kellecruz @alyssaharad @astrokatey @michael_w_busch "emotionally manipulative"? But  not quite right and not catchy.
@niais @Summer_Ash @nhuntwalker I still like "Magic".
@nhuntwalker @Summer_Ash My mom was having that problem regularly and the doctor told her "eat dried apricots" and it went away....
@BenneHolwerda @niais Didn't know! That's great!!!
@nhuntwalker @niais @McIntyreKmci That said  I do agree that there was strong foreshadowing of a path that didn't get taken in Force Awakens
@nhuntwalker @niais @McIntyreKmci It's the old "just because you CAN  doesn't mean you have to".
@mcnees @orzelc Like THEY'D not wake YOU up if they wanted something? Fair  F'ing play  Cheeks. Go get papa some ice cream.
@niais @IBJIYONGI @hubbahubble The superb @knottyyarn wrote a lot about the challenge of being black in Seattle when she was leaving.
@hubbahubble There's probably something around being hot and having their motions locked  but I don't think I'm ready to go there...
@NGC3314 @TSHamiltonAstro @kevinschawinski @BenneHolwerda That's a pretty one!!!!
@_sarahmartell_ @niais @AstroKatie I just kept getting bigger and bigger  and class was 90 minutes long. The mind wanders  I suppose.
@niais @_sarahmartell_ @AstroKatie There's a reason these aren't revealed until after the quarter. That said  I was largely amused.
@niais @_sarahmartell_ @AstroKatie "I spent the quarter trying to figure out if she was pregnant or not".
@niais @_sarahmartell_ @AstroKatie One of my fave student feedback comments  under "what detracted from your learning" was (1/2)
@astronomolly @jegpeek Is it my imagination or is this particularly pervasive in the ISM community?
@IBJIYONGI @hubbahubble Celebratory Twitter is always my favorite Twitter.
@amyekimball Boo HISSSSS!!!!!
@bradpholden @jegpeek @astronomeara True. But we will need a lot more than one telescope for follow-up spectroscopy  for sure.
@astronomeara @jegpeek @bradpholden Does the proposed CFHT survey instrument match the requirements (except for being non-US)?
@mcnees I  would prefer just to take it!
@mcnees I would be -super- into this class.
@nhuntwalker @CodeFellowsSEA Nobody ever balances right on the knife edge. I'll always take "a bit too driven" over "not much ambition".
@nhuntwalker @750words @CodeFellowsSEA Aw! That's great!
@AsteroidEnergy First three papers here: https://t.co/qbSjHeYgtt
@BlkGrlMgc @eilatg @adiamondstanic @jbprime @astroprofhoff I scan for core physics  highest level math taken  bonus point for CS exposure.
@BlkGrlMgc @eilatg @adiamondstanic @jbprime @astroprofhoff Agreed. Achieving a "major" secondary to "what classes did you take".
@nhuntwalker I am a fan. May be jet lagged so happy hourish?
@InvaderXan @BenneHolwerda You can do both -- it's just the slides may be a bit brief which can be good (quick study) or bad (too terse).
@InvaderXan @BenneHolwerda I skimmed this new book  and it hits many similar themes. https://t.co/A1ziKoBlu4
@InvaderXan @BenneHolwerda I'm fine with limited personal use. Might get a bit irked if someone lifted them wholesale for teachng w/o notice
@BenneHolwerda https://t.co/0EmP5GFbbB -- Only the links from the first three weeks are live.
@Lynne73 @amyekimball Yeah  it's an on-going challenge.
@amyekimball @Lynne73 I take unleashed dogs seriously.
@amyekimball @Lynne73 Traumatic brain injury. She's the rear admiral of a tandem  and was launched when the front of the bike was attacked.
@Lynne73 @amyekimball I'm guessing unleashed dogs. Which is why my bike-riding mom has a TBI.
@nhuntwalker That's excellent. "focusing on everything is the same thing as focusing on nothing." #guilty
@carylgronwall @MBKplus @astronomolly @rachelosten I guess we can be thankful for the 1K proposal making the rest of us look cheap.
@astronomolly @rachelosten There was a multicycle call  which liberated people to think beyond a few hundred orbits.
@sondy The details on their costumes were *amazing*.
@astraughnomer @NASAGoddard Congrats!!!!!!!
@sondy Hard core!
@nhuntwalker Gotta get together so I can give it to you and hear about the new gig!
@sondy Ha! Did it take ENDLESS PAPER MÂCHÉ for you as well???
@sondy @dstndstn @YourPaperSucks High five!
@astronomeara Tumlinson style!
@taylored4astro @laurawatkins_ @BenneHolwerda @jegpeek I'm grateful for thorough edits. It means they found what needs fixing.
@rareflwr41 @BenneHolwerda @laurawatkins_ That's a drag  when good ideas sag under the weight of not-quite-good-enough instruction.
@BenneHolwerda @jegpeek @laurawatkins_ Editing feels like trying to pull them apart....
@rareflwr41 @BenneHolwerda @laurawatkins_ There was a "Grad Skills" class? That's a good concept!  But I could see how execution is tricky.
@BenneHolwerda @jegpeek @laurawatkins_ Would that it were so simple  Benne.
@BenneHolwerda @laurawatkins_ Yup. For the first half of the course (at least)  the class is 1/3 writing process  1/3 guidelines  1/3 edits.
@mcnees @hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI @niais Sorry  I'll leave you adults to have your adult conversation. &lt;goes back to writing proposals&gt;
@mcnees @hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI @niais DEPLOY THE INTERGALACTIC SWIFFER!!!!!!!!
@NGC3314 @eblur27 We kept on safeing HST by trying to look at GR8.  Very x-files.
@NGC3314 Swift had a CD with a theme song.
@mcnees @AstroKatie @brianwolven "Poor ratio of bounce to the ounce."
@mcnees @AstroKatie @brianwolven "Despite their efforts  the authors failed to get jiggy with it."
@mcnees @AstroKatie @brianwolven "Insufficiently jiggy" would be the best/worst proposal review commentary.
@mcnees @AstroKatie @brianwolven New bio?
@kittykaraoke @AstroKatie @brianwolven @mcnees Your gif game is strong tonight  Sean.
@nhuntwalker @Summer_Ash See  that sounds judgey.  I wouldn't want that.
@Summer_Ash @nhuntwalker Is 750 words about getting back in the writing zone which will help science writing or is it more self-reflection?
@InvaderXan @instagram I get their trying to optimize the default  but please let others opt out!
@mcnees Mine was how a discussion of the literature was entirely dissing the haters.
@SCIPLUS @astrokatey I'm just sad "she-devils" was already taken.
@darth "I WILL KILL YOU WIF MY TEEFS!!!!" https://t.co/mp0zVBfrk4 https://t.co/XK5mGiwXki

@darth But truly  I guffawed.
@RobbLoeb @startorialist @darth Custom sized from https://t.co/5TKocuHMiQ  for hard to fit dogs!
@darth She is the dog version of Duck McScrooge  squashing the proletariat.
@darth Is this a dog who deserves nice things like a Pikachu hat? NO IT IS NOT. https://t.co/4aSbL1chwI
@darth FYI  PJs are from https://t.co/5TKocuHMiQ
@darth The other pup is Elfie  Destroyer of Worlds.  She gets nothing.
@KnudJahnke I don't understand what you're saying. Google translate isn't helping.
Ok internet. My dog now has turtleneck space pajamas. @startorialist https://t.co/Zgb8E80TfL
@jradavenport @StartsWithABang @PeterYoachim @niais Woah -- didn't realize you actually missed it!
@BenneHolwerda @jradavenport oooooo SNAP! (and 100% correct)
@nhuntwalker They were both fantastic in Season 2!
@nhuntwalker !!!!!!!!!!!! Yay  you.
@astronomeara DOOOOOOOOO IT!!!
@PeterYoachim I was using Toodledo for a while. I think @nhuntwalker also has one he really likes.
@jbprime @AstroKatie @JossBlandHawtho @planet4589 I had an early microlensing limit that held for a long while: https://t.co/NA7H3ayfwE
@BenneHolwerda @astronomolly Do we have a HST proposal tag yet?
@emilylurice @jegpeek I've always been stunned that people let that one go without a major ruckus.
@j_bellovary @nhuntwalker Heh heh heh heh.
@nhuntwalker Looking forward to hearing about the new gig when things settle down!
@nhuntwalker You can mail a caucus form in  but you had to do it by the 18th...
@nhuntwalker We have a great vote-by-mail system. Why can't we just use that?
@nhuntwalker You have to work then? Can't caucus. Kids are sick? Can't caucus. Don't speak english? Damn hard to caucus.
@nhuntwalker Good for participatory democracy  but bad  because caucuses are a ridiculously privileged way to decide something important.
@lukedones @paparatti Oh Seattle.
@lukedones @IBJIYONGI The weeks that the h-bar closes are sad  desperate times in PAB.
@IBJIYONGI @eteq   &lt;LMC sees SMC about to crash into Milky Way&gt;  LMC: "I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE!!!"
@DudeDarkmatter @PeterDEdmonds @JossBlandHawtho There were strong hints from lensing rates that path lengths were longer than expected.
@shaka_lulu Yeah  it's been bugging the crap out of me.
@astrokiwi @eteq @abigailStev @jradavenport YESSSSS!
@eteq @astrokiwi @abigailStev @jradavenport So  you can do the equivalent of sequential builds like you'd use in talks.
@eteq @astrokiwi @abigailStev @jradavenport Ppl who only look at the figures are also unlikely to spend the time to decipher multiple axes.
@eteq @astrokiwi @abigailStev @jradavenport One solution is to make 2 plots instead of one. Page charges aren't -that- expensive  people.
@nhuntwalker Bring it on  Universe!
@brettmor @GeertHub @astropy @eteq Writing a python version of IRAF's "splot".
@kejames @Lexialex I love how it also points home the cruelty of "to make it through  make yourself more like me"= cut off parts of yourself
@nhuntwalker Or...binge the new season of Daredevil that just came out?
@nhuntwalker That thing where you make a bunch of outdoor plans in the first 15 minutes you're up  then....nevermind.
@mcnees That's right up there with "This statement is a lie".
@mcnees My daughter  who knows NOTHING about basketball  is ahead in her pool by 20 points.
@michelle_lmc Where "vegetable" is singular.
Never  I said NEVER  piss off Charlie Pierce @ESQPolitics https://t.co/j8FD9dcCsO https://t.co/EOKXCSJQn2
@nhuntwalker In an environment that cultivates an illusion of a perfect oasis of learning  so of course nothing is wrong.
@jbprime @niais @emilylurice But it's ok. He really had no obligation to interact with local kids. He was doing his part in other ways.
@lukedones Author related to Helen Bonham-Carter? How many Bohnam-Carters can there be?
@robertcnichol Everyone should have a hobby.
@StartsWithABang @niais @sadydoyle Well  if he was your Kirk  I don't wanna take that from you.
@StartsWithABang @niais @sadydoyle Riker did not have charisma. He thought he had charisma  but no one really liked him.
@nhuntwalker I'm liking this one. https://t.co/t79FVagcRt
@nhuntwalker Nick  I commit to getting Dr. Hunt-Walker a tophat and sword.
@katemath @kejames @Alex_Parker &lt;spittake&gt;
@Alex_Parker @kejames It's like 90 minutes of hand-crafted artisan Spotify.
@kejames @niais @astronomolly It took me a while to figure it out.
@kejames @niais @astronomolly In high school a sweet guy confessed his affection by giving me a #TweetYourMixtape of Triumph love songs.
@kejames @niais @astronomolly There probably needs to be a #TweetYourMixtape hashtag.
@mcnees @Summer_Ash Maybe she needs a blessing from Cheeks.
@astronomeara @jegpeek @fuckeveryword Has someone done a ranked list?
@astronomeara @jegpeek @fuckeveryword I've been fascinated with why some combinations get more likes and retweets than others.
@nhuntwalker Shoot!
@dstndstn @albertoconti @adrianprw @GeertHub @jegpeek SDSS definitely centralized a major layer of analysis.
@amyekimball No such luck. It's like you just stand there  but move.
@nhuntwalker Did you ever run into "Blogging the Bible"? https://t.co/4JoEFF2YHe
@ImKarenAtSchool @kejames Amazing!!!!
@_MissNomer @ESQPolitics @sariweather @sassycrass &lt;snort&gt;
@nhuntwalker @davidwhogg @dstndstn @melissakness Only in Seattle is "actually getting on the damn bus" cast as "rude selfishness".
@jegpeek @dstndstn I got one of their necklaces as a birthday present  because my husband is awesome.
@mcnees @Disney And maybe the movie is about getting her AND the lightsaver she found back to the rebel alliance.
@mcnees @Disney Until the climactic fight scene where she gets it right right before she kills the bad guy. (2/2)
@mcnees @Disney That could be the running gag. She mispronounces it differently every time (1/2)
@mcnees @Disney I think they befriend a little girl and work together to bring her to safety.  The little girl would have adorable cheeks.
@startorialist @Summer_Ash @slowfactory_ I WILL KEEP ALL APPENDAGES CROSSED IN HOPES OF ANDROMEDA PHATWEAR!
@michelle_lmc @surreyastro That little dome is adorable.
@lukedones My daughter's elementary school music teacher taught them to sing "Boris the Spider" and "Magic Bus".
@katerice22 @Discovery You might want to check out https://t.co/jQFaRhkltP -- there are lots of astronomy projects that could use your help!
@SCTrager @albertoconti I was more about "Its really fun to take hits of O2 and have my heart slow to less than 120 bpm"! Also  daytime.
@SCTrager @albertoconti Every time I went off supplemental oxygen it was a disaster.
@SCTrager @albertoconti Thanks Scott! Though that look of determination is me muttering "Don't pass out. Don't pass out " at 14 000 ft.
@hubbahubble Sorry I missed you!
@hubbahubble You in town? &lt;waves&gt;
@Summer_Ash @startorialist My husband surprised me with a piece for my birthday and it's gorgeous. It's foldable &amp; light so great for travel
@Summer_Ash Have you seen the 3D printed stuff from n.e.r.v.o.u.s system? It's not officially @startorialist but it's geeky and gorgeous.
@niais @nhuntwalker @UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @Summer_Ash Yelling  but in a supportive way.
@nhuntwalker @UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @niais @Summer_Ash I guess for me it's about freeing myself from decisions.
@nhuntwalker @UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @niais @Summer_Ash "Why haven't you made that plot? I TOLD YOU TO MAKE THAT PLOT!"
@nhuntwalker @UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @niais @Summer_Ash I want something more like the tough sergeant from boot camp.
@UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash I've got this in spades. I really need a buddy system.
@UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash ...but will disappoint yourself over and over and over again.
@UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash Yeah  that thing where you'll do anything to avoid disappointing others...
@UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash But it won't come if you're not actually doing it.
@UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash This is so true. You never know when your best stuff is going to come.
@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash @astroprofhoff That is genius and deep.
@nhuntwalker @hubbahubble It's one bonus of kids -- they really enforce downtime.
@nhuntwalker It's so messed up.
@nhuntwalker I think @hubbahubble had some good lifehacking rewards built into her system.
@nhuntwalker I should talk to you about what you're using!
@nhuntwalker Hell yeah. I don't know why so many of us are incredibly mean to ourselves  in ways we'd never treat other people.
@nhuntwalker So  key is the classic "breaking down tasks into smaller ones"  &amp; then letting yourself say "Good enough! Good job!" when done.
@nhuntwalker It's setting oneself up for failure  frustration  and despair.
@nhuntwalker And that means you're *never* going to get the needed moments of satisfaction on a daily/weekly basis.
@nhuntwalker The key is that we often give ourselves impossibly huge scopes. Such as "I need to finish my thesis".
@nhuntwalker I saw this great "inspirational poster" (eyeroll) about the power of "done". Something being "done" is mentally liberating.
@lukedones @TheAVClub Not so sure about that.... https://t.co/VKMPzOTjUC
@merrdiff @LSST @UW For realsies? That's great!!!!!
@PlanetDr But more importantly  YOUR ADORABLE FLOOFY DOG IS CHIRPING IN A NYT ARTICLE!!!! This IS a great day for science.
@reneehlozek @hubbahubble Bingo!
@nhuntwalker I looooved Evil Cisco!
@hubbahubble If you time your boarding right  you can sit next to the pilot!
@nhuntwalker Ok  I'm on the east coast  and  um  YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE FLASH!!!!!
@nhuntwalker @niais Candidates then spend all their effort honing a very limited message.
@nhuntwalker @niais Yeah  but that would largely amount to "NE picks the dem nominee and SE picks the republican".
@nhuntwalker @niais I'd be happy with a system that did 4 states at a time -- one NE  one SE  one Midwest  one west coast in each round.
@nhuntwalker @niais (Though I worry that if it were national  all that would matter is "who has the most $$ to buy ads")
@nhuntwalker @niais Because the fate of the nation would not rest on the opinions of Real Americans in Iowa and NH?
@mcnees @BruceRauner They are clearly doing good work nurturing a student population with great potential.
.@mcnees @BruceRauner Our department's graduate school applicant pool regularly features terrific candidates from Chicago State.
@shaka_lulu @vrooje @jradavenport There's also a bias that creeps in that favors a "performance" of this kind of intelligence.
@shaka_lulu @jradavenport So  desensitizing the emotional response so you can grapple with questions can really help.
@shaka_lulu @jradavenport Also  a lot of questioning that feels "aggressive" is not actually personal  rather than "probing the science".
@shaka_lulu @jradavenport I wonder if there is a useful way to simulate the process  to develop the habit in a realistic-but-safe situation.
@shaka_lulu @jradavenport So we should do some more aggressive hazing to better prepare you for the outside world?
@Jos_de_Bruijne @ScienceChannel @Arianespace @arianespaceceo The telescope will actually fold in thirds to fit! It's pretty amazing.
@mcnees A chirp of GW experimentalists? A ring? #scientistherdnames
@nhuntwalker @jradavenport @sajuks @KirkDBorne Write an algorithm on the board that provides an O(N) solution for finding the # of coins.
@nhuntwalker @sajuks @KirkDBorne Is that all?
@cwmagee &lt;Raises glass&gt;
@karinsandstrom @cwmagee @jegpeek All the secrets come out!!!
@cwmagee People would work on excel spreadsheets on the birthday for play? I am not one of those people.
.@Alex_Parker @brianwolven I am totally on board with this. @philrosenfield
@astrokatey That too. But really  what would be the point if you didn't have AGB star mass loss to look at?
@mcnees I am squirming as I hold back tweeting every goddamn line from the movie.
@jegpeek I'm ok when it's labeled  and there's just a few. Instead  it'll be a sparse timeline going back an hour but missing lots.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor They could charge you 1/25th a page to rent out the corners.
@brettmor @nhuntwalker The left shark projection.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @jradavenport @delurieous What about a randomly rotating animated globe?
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @jradavenport @delurieous To thine own self be true.
@davidwhogg @NGC3314 @HIgalaxies So  we know pretty much the same things as before the launch of HST? Really  David?
@davidwhogg @NGC3314 @HIgalaxies Step backwards for what? Understanding of galaxies certainly benefited.
@NGC3314 @SARA_Obs That's almost an Orion doppleganger.
@InvaderXan Maybe adding "Be kind to self" would cover it? Sometimes I notice that I would *never* treat others the way I treat myself.
@InvaderXan I love this plan. But I'd add "forgiveness of self" for the days that Operation: You Deserve Better takes a needed day off...
@NGC3314 "overlapping self-adhesive linear occulters"
@BenneHolwerda @AAS_Publishing @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim @chrislintott My concept was that those PPT links could link to diff figs.
@niais @Summer_Ash @PlanetDr I hate crying on planes.
@mcnees @DrDa5id @niais @IBJIYONGI But if I click a fist but they see a heart  that's still not ideal. Stoopid Twitter.
@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim @chrislintott @AAS_Publishing Would save a ton of community effort hacking plots to readability.
@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim @chrislintott @AAS_Publishing Could do a modified one for "presentation version".
@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim @chrislintott @AAS_Publishing Some med journals let you click on figures to get pptx slide.
@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim @chrislintott @AAS_Publishing Also liked the idea of a switch for presentation version.
@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim Isn't @chrislintott involved in @AAS_Publishing as well?
@amyekimball ENCHILADAS FOR LIFE!
@PlanetDr (No matter how awesome planets are)
@PlanetDr And it's not like astronomy's record on minority training and hiring is anything to feel superior about.
@PlanetDr Yeah  but they want to be coders.
@astronomolly @PlanetDr And skinny  as in "an excess of skin that spreads and creates an illusion of fatcattedness".
@astronomolly @PlanetDr I love a fat flattened cat.
@kgarofali @nhuntwalker FFS.
@NGC3314 It is a gif that applies to so  so many things.
@CW_Arrow saves Dark's family. Youngest asks hopefully "Time for hugs?" #Arrow @nhuntwalker @McIntyreKmci
@DrMRFrancis @astro_jje @docfreeride Sorry. Do not want to be an obstacle on the road to bourbon.
@astro_jje @docfreeride @DrMRFrancis I'm a fan of talking it out with someone. Articulating why it's hard usually helps me find the fix.
@gsnarayan @astronomolly Unless SNO's big ball of heavy water fell on you. That would be bad.
@astronomolly @gsnarayan Neutrino astrophysicists are actually underground astronomers.
@NGC3314 There are a bunch of papers arguing forms of this  so you are not alone!
@BenneHolwerda @jegpeek @nfmartin1980 @astronomolly @NASAWFIRST Some combination of continuous + sparse coverage is frequently useful...
@BenneHolwerda @jegpeek @nfmartin1980 @astronomolly @NASAWFIRST There's nothing that says that *can't* wind up being the camera layout.
@JellySock @albertoconti @DeepAstronomy @ProfSaraSeager Me too!
@Lynne73 @BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts The biking infrastructure is also gradually getting better  w/ more separated bikeways.
@davidwhogg @astronomeara @exoplaneteer I'm baffled. What does this gain you?
@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts I've been in too many bike accidents and near misses to be complacent.
@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts ...but then stick your kids in heavy  ill-behaved traffic with nothing but a bit of foam on their heads?
@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts If you are scrupulous about seatbelts and cars with the best safety features...
@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts I do it  but I have serious qualms about taking kids in traffic here.
@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts It's not just the hills. Biking in Seattle is not safe.
@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts There is a "Dutch Bike" store in Seattle  so there's a local market.
@PeterYoachim @mcnees HAHAHAHAHAHA
@NGC3314 No. I'm saving that for my 50's.
@amyekimball Right?!?! But 15 yr olds are awesome so it makes it ok.
@shaka_lulu @jonathansick Oh hell yeah. They have an octopus rug. https://t.co/p6ffSs08Xe
@NGC3314 @keckobservatory If there are dates in the header  you can probably figure out who was observing...
@BenneHolwerda @ebellm @jradavenport Yeah  postdoc advising is usually pretty random. More places (UW included) need to do better.
@mcnees Sometimes  they wear icing.
@nhuntwalker "I failed because this situation was one that would never play to my strengths" is *way* more emotionally neutral &amp; useful.
@nhuntwalker Probably helps with imposter syndrome too  by moving away from a generic "I failed because I'm not good enough".
@nhuntwalker It's so good to break this down. It's like "Oh. That's why that situation wasn't working for me."
@KnudJahnke That said  many of the stories in #astroSH involve fear for actual physical safety that take it to a different level.
@KnudJahnke Agreed that bullying is a huge problem too. Discussing #astroSH doesn't mean other harassment isn't important to deal with.
@sondy FFS.

@brianwolven @Alex_Parker @mcnees @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Though I think the Venusian transit affects the flavor.
@brianwolven @Alex_Parker @mcnees @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera On a beer float.
@brianwolven @Alex_Parker @mcnees @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera To be clear  I only joke out of admiration for your living life right
@brianwolven @Alex_Parker @mcnees @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera And discover a new species of insect.
@brianwolven @Alex_Parker @mcnees @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera While they were rafting.
@Alex_Parker @mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Well  we've been wondering.
@Alex_Parker @mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Though it's probably wine you made yourself from hemp and pork fat.
@Alex_Parker @mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera I'm so out I'm in!
@mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @Alex_Parker @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera I'm having 3 day old wine. I'm NegaAlex Parker.
@mcnees @brianwolven @emilylurice @Alex_Parker @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Me neither. Friend got back from Costa Rica. RB floats w/ rum!!!!
@amyekimball I MADE THE CUT!!!!!!
@amyekimball I actually wind up referring to these sometimes when I teach...
@docfreeride @orzelc @reneehlozek And by choosing to employ you  I am sending a message about my own values.
@docfreeride @orzelc @reneehlozek It's not worth the real risk that you'll slip again.
@docfreeride @orzelc @reneehlozek Agreed. Most of this stuff  I don't care how bad you feel about what you did.
@astronomeara @astronomolly Who'd you take it with?
@astronomeara @astronomolly Whooooo boy. That'll be a....growthful experience.
@astronomolly @astronomeara The O'Meara diagram of rates of production of Peeples-Dalcanton diagrams....
@orzelc @reneehlozek A lot of that would and should be private  however  making external judgements of real reform harder.
@orzelc @reneehlozek ...people who were genuinely capable of reforming might actually reform  and stop.
@orzelc @reneehlozek If institutions found out about the smaller stuff before it became bigger stuff  and actually intervened ...
@orzelc @reneehlozek I think assessment might be easier if there were more ways to intervene earlier.
@mcnees @orzelc But we all tell these stories to ourselves as well. No one likes to think they're a Bad Person.
@orzelc @reneehlozek That's a pretty low bar.
@astraughnomer Please. You're totally covering up that NASA is building a Space Accordion.
@PlanetDr My dogs are merely dorktastic.
@PlanetDr That *is* a booplefloof!
@e_astronomer @Meg_Urry (The old "one" vs "you" pitfall...)
@e_astronomer @Meg_Urry Whoops! Did not mean it as such -- I was aiming for "neutral factual statement" rather than admonishment!
@e_astronomer @Meg_Urry If your actions show that you can be trusted to be a force for good  you'll probably start hearing more.
@e_astronomer @Meg_Urry It's typical to bury this stuff because they have no faith or trust that it will be dealt with.
@e_astronomer @Meg_Urry I would strongly doubt it's a US-only problem.
@docfreeride @ct_la Seconded.
@ct_la @docfreeride The endless battle between holding people accountable vs putting stuff behind you for sanity....
@ct_la @docfreeride Well  it's *better*  but still flawed. I'm sorry it didn't get better fast enough for your path to be different.
@nhuntwalker @niais I use emacs so it would have to be my right pinky.
@niais @nhuntwalker My eldest does. She loves both kids and money. Youngest can do "mother's helper" gigs.
@nhuntwalker @PeterYoachim @niais It's often a harder problem when your kids are school age.
@nhuntwalker @niais I would have given a pinky to have family in the same city.
@nhuntwalker @niais Oh yeah. We didn't live close  but would (and could afford to) fly family in when I had work travel.
@PeterYoachim @nhuntwalker @niais &lt;shudder&gt;summers&lt;/shudders&gt;
@nhuntwalker @niais Always a good time to get married  but never a good time to plan and pay for a wedding...
@nhuntwalker @niais But  if you're in an entry-level position that can go somewhere you want to go  then keeping to at least part time helps
@nhuntwalker @niais If you're in a holding pattern job  then yeah  definitely stop slinging espresso and save the money.
@nhuntwalker @niais Childcare can be an investment in your future earning power  for certain career paths.
@nhuntwalker @niais Definitely  but it's short and long term $'s too. We're more secure now because neither of our careers stalled
@nhuntwalker @niais I remember my mom pointing out that there was never going to be a "good time" -- "Hmm  my next 18 years? totally clear."
@nhuntwalker @niais This convo makes it sound impossible and awful  but I still have no regrets about having kids. #weird
@nhuntwalker @niais Your day is abbreviated  but you can often get a second shift in after kids go to sleep. Provided they sleep.
@nhuntwalker @niais There's a reason my students and colleagues would always get email from me at midnight.
@nhuntwalker @niais And yeah  the day to day scheduling stuff is crazy. Both my and my husband's jobs are flexible  and it's still tough.
@nhuntwalker @niais Yup. Definitely not trying to imply that it's cheap!  Every time a kid enters kindergarten  it's like getting a raise.
@nhuntwalker @niais But costs at infant level are way more expensive than at preschool age  so even 1 year off can save a ton.
@nhuntwalker @niais It's basically college tuition level expenses without 18 years of previous saving.
@archillect @VealSlab I think it might be ESO's VISTA telescope: https://t.co/nwhqpHlnT9
@albertoconti @blakebullock @JasonKalirai @ProfSaraSeager @matt_mountain That's a terrific picture of everyone!
@nhuntwalker I *still* have a problem with it  even now that I really can buy my own damn food.
@astrofairy @RoyalAstroSoc @apontzen Congrats  Andrew!
@_sarahmartell_ @niais @mcnees Right? Someone on a playground once opined that with parenting "the years are short but the days are long".
@Thomas_Connor @niais @mcnees Not to mention anything about our relative velocities.
@niais @mcnees My eldest kid just turned 15 today  so she's closer to 25 than I am.
@mcnees The map for "one" looks uniform. It gets more un-uniform up to six and then smooths out again.
@mcnees And the mountain west never says never. https://t.co/kunK3539v0
@mcnees Why the regional bias against certain numbers? https://t.co/LpXIHhB65c
@mcnees Could be boob-related  maybe?
@niais @mcnees #TeamOldEnoughToRemember
@mcnees @niais Only in Alaska are you free enough to live that dream.
@niais @mcnees Like *you* weren't also searching for gerbils. Come on  Sarah.
@mcnees Alaska's pulling its weight though.
@mcnees I got a lot of mileage out of searching for various internal organs. Spleen. Pancreas. Liver. Bladder.

@mcnees Why do some places care so much about the pancreas?
@mcnees So that I can tell you how much time I wasted entering random words into the twitter mapping search you sent around?
@bradpholden @nhuntwalker A girlfriend of mine took up piano because she realized her kids never saw their parents struggling.
@bradpholden @nhuntwalker But they're often really happy to see more senior people struggle the same struggle.
@_sarahmartell_ @nhuntwalker Twitter: Come for the cute animal pictures  stay for the accidental community mentoring.
@Cosmic_Horizons @darth_ben @nhuntwalker @DudeDarkmatter @astronomolly @jradavenport Except me. I just seem to persist at being old.
@Alex_Parker @nhuntwalker Tod speaks highly of it.
@astronomolly @jradavenport @nhuntwalker The ascii shrug works.
@jradavenport @astronomolly @nhuntwalker "and then I headdesked."
@astronomolly @nhuntwalker I -finally- shot it down though. Which is better than publishing something exciting but TOTALLY WRONG.
@astronomolly @nhuntwalker I'd always suspected that "interesting feature" was an artifact but it kept standing up to every test.
@astronomolly @nhuntwalker I wasted my sabbatical writing a 95 page paper that I finally figured out was wrong.
@nhuntwalker You may currently suck at algorithms but you're doing good on the "life coaching" bit!
@nhuntwalker Yup. And If you don't start with your baby steps  you never run.
@nhuntwalker I need this framed in my office or in a needlepoint pillow.
@nhuntwalker I think these fears contribute to why a lot of mid career folks drift more into admin and astro-management.
@nhuntwalker Plus  you start to wonder if you're even still smart enough.  Maybe my best work IS behind me.
@nhuntwalker But  I'm so overcommitted I wonder if I even have the time needed to invest in the necessary growth. Which sucks.
@nhuntwalker And  it's time for me to stretch in new directions.
@nhuntwalker I'm currently facing this from a mid career perspective. I've spent a significant frac of a decade thinking about a few things.
@nhuntwalker Actually a feature of most research careers.
@nhuntwalker Yeah  it hurts to throw yourself at your ignorance when you've gotten comfortable with mastery elsewhere.
@nhuntwalker &lt;thumbs up!&gt;
@nhuntwalker Growth mindset  Nick! "I suck at algorithms RIGHT NOW."
@megschwamb That's a great term. Sad  but great.
@jonathansick @ruthangus @jradavenport @GeertHub @libcce @eteq @shaka_lulu @chrislintott @adrianprw @davidwhogg Hacking= The new afterparty?
@jradavenport @jegpeek Seconded. I'm going to be teaching a "writing for grad students" class in the spring and was hoping to cover this!
@Alex_Parker @astronomolly @startorialist Though now I'm wanting a 4 pieces set of different regions  because GREEDY!!!!!
@Alex_Parker @astronomolly @startorialist Yay!
@Alex_Parker @astronomolly @startorialist Which I say because your usual MO is to fix problems as soon as mentioned....
@Alex_Parker @astronomolly @startorialist Though sadly  they're melamine and not ceramic....
@Alex_Parker @astronomolly @startorialist Ha! And have a banquet service.
@PlanetDr @aomawa @startorialist @astronomolly Yup! That's why I only have a picture of the display rather than ALL OF THEM.

@shaka_lulu I am not there! 1st time in ages  &amp; I AM MISSING MEETING AWESOME STUDENTS! I think @jradavenport @nogreenstars Alexia JohnRuan?
@astronomolly @startorialist Also have been eyeballing this: https://t.co/zSzjJXBkdL
@astronomolly @startorialist I am already lobbying for a couple of these gorgeous (but overpriced) plates: https://t.co/sLhXngnR99
@startorialist @astronomolly I have been hoping and dreaming....
@michelle_lmc No. Not at all.
@InvaderXan Question for @corbett?
@niais @carylgronwall Another question: Do we need 2 meetings a year? @AAS_Office #aas227
@nhuntwalker @magnus99k I def sympathize with the motivation. But it's notable in being about the only thing that he maybe didn't get right!
@nhuntwalker @magnus99k I'm pro Joe West but telling Iris her mom was dead was a dick move.
@mcnees I get this.
@astronomolly @astronomeara There should be a "photos with PHAT" hashtag.
@astronomeara That's very nice  but I refuse to answer a courtesy telephone at the Gaylord.
@emilylurice @astronomeara @astronomolly It's hard to tell but I'm thinking those are animatronics?
@astronomeara @astronomolly I'm remotely fascinated by this venue while at the same time having no desire to ever  ever experience it.
@shaka_lulu @RubixsQube Where winter may or not be coming  depending on your model atmosphere.
@Summer_Ash @shaka_lulu NYC. He's based in Seattle  but I think travels.
@Summer_Ash @shaka_lulu You might want to see if this guy is planning to pass through. Amazing work. https://t.co/dHU8VyoMTu
@mcnees Your sleep was astronomically insignificant though.
@jbprime Which is the only galaxy in this fight with a REAL bulge? That's right. Andromeda.
@jbprime Andromeda is ready to sick M32 on Milky Way's ass.
@jbprime Milky Way's mouth is writing checks it can't cash.
@LonelyProbe That's fine. Everyone is allowed to enjoy art as they choose.
@astronomolly @robminchin @jegpeek This seems to be a theme. I think you're spending too much time out of town!!!
@astronomolly @BenneHolwerda I hope there will still be some in February!
@nhuntwalker @jradavenport @niais For real. Seattle needs waaaaaay more low income housing  embedded EVERYWHERE.
@nhuntwalker @niais ...but then reacting poorly when their cultural norms are not instantly embraced by the  existing culture.
@nhuntwalker @niais (i.e. Embracing sending their kids to public schools where white kids aren't the dominant culture....
@nhuntwalker @niais Lots of mistakes made for all the predictable reasons  at the same time that people are doing lots of the "right" things
@nhuntwalker @niais Eager beaver white parents bringing money and gung-ho-ness to public schools that historically served black students.
@nhuntwalker @niais I'll have to dig it up but there were some really interesting Times pieces about schools negotiating changes.
@nhuntwalker @niais I'd totally look at the neighborhoods in east/south Seattle that are light rail accessible.
@niais @nhuntwalker My eldest fled the local school for high school because she was (rightfully) sick of it.
@niais @nhuntwalker It's pretty uniform. And since they changed how school assignment is done  the schools are resegregating fast.
@niais @nhuntwalker Right where I am  it's not so bad  because I'm not zoned single family. But  all the SF zoned stuff north of the canal?
@niais @nhuntwalker (grammar is hard)
@niais @nhuntwalker Which explains why so much of why my 5 mile radius is pretty damn white.
@niais @nhuntwalker But  I later found out that that choice put me in Seattle's historically redlined areas.
@niais @nhuntwalker Bridges = significant commute time.
@niais @nhuntwalker We were in the same boat (knew my job but not his). Chose to look only where I wouldn't have to cross a bridge.
@niais @nhuntwalker Happy to skype over this if you want.
@astronomeara @nhuntwalker @brettmor I thought about getting them to cater one of the PHAT team meetings.
@astronomeara @nhuntwalker @brettmor When you have a collaborative visit with Jess  we will make Tropicos Breeze happen. Full bar too.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor Also  you can park at the Oaktree  buy tix for a movie  get your drink on at TB  then sober up at the cinema.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor The baliadas are my fave.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor And really  Tropicos Breeze is freakin' perfect. Pupusas  tamales  green booths  and continual Univision.
@astronomolly @BenneHolwerda @xayma @te_pickering Yeah  while the Kindle has that functionality  it's definitely not as easy.
@BenneHolwerda @xayma @astronomolly @te_pickering I first switched for travel weight  but my vision is going and now I love font adjustment.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor Also  it's right around the corner from Tropicos Breeze  which has excellent cheap Central American food.
@nhuntwalker @brettmor There's also a pretty big one right to the Oaktree cinema on Aurora. More parking.
@VealSlab Right???
@megschwamb @lukedones And @caprastro.
@mcnees @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI @Mad_Science_Guy But guess what? Funding cuts! No money to allow us to offer it again.
@mcnees @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI @Mad_Science_Guy Those students had real world credentials when applying for jobs.
@mcnees @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI @Mad_Science_Guy UW used to offer evening 101 class that was often taught by grad students.
@IBJIYONGI @mcnees @Mad_Science_Guy Step away from the eggnog  McNees.
@masequeira1 @PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI At 18  you're often advanced if you know enough to do your own laundry.
@masequeira1 @PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI And in what other field are we expecting people to demonstrate deep intellectual insight at EIGHTEEN?!?
@IBJIYONGI @PlanetDr ESG at MIT was pretty amazing. I'm so glad I started out that way.
@PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI I finally mastered E&amp;M when I took a class on motors. It moved into a physical  kinematic part of my brain.
@IBJIYONGI @PlanetDr Because that's who a lot of the professoriate is made of. And so the cycle continues....
@PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI And the signaling works in the opposite reinforcing way if you're "in". "Ah yes  I -do- know this  because I'm special"
@Summer_Ash @Cheekmergency @mcnees Merry Cheeksmas  Estonia!
@Summer_Ash @Cheekmergency @mcnees "Translate from Estonian"? https://t.co/Yr0JaPI8IZ
@Summer_Ash @mcnees @IBJIYONGI Queen of the Cheekdom
@DrRubidium @mcnees Oh my gawd.
@mcnees You sit on a throne of lies.
@mcnees @CavanaghTom We couldn't believe it!!!!!!!!! (Also  I'm only pretending that I wasn't about as excited as she was)
@nhuntwalker @Summer_Ash @astronomeara @SCTrager Seconded!!!!
@nhuntwalker @astronomeara @Summer_Ash @SCTrager Yes!!!  THERE WILL BE NO OTHER!!!
@nhuntwalker @SCTrager @astronomeara @Jidenna Prince?
@SCTrager @astronomeara @nhuntwalker Has someone come up with the definitive #BlackHarryPotter Lockhart yet?
@nhuntwalker @astronomeara Naw. She's too smart and focused. I'm going with Ginny. Though she could ham it up as Bellatrix.
@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash Must be! One benefit having totally different jobs is that work-related convos focus on the meta level.
@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash I was very touched when my future husband asked me about "the TAC" when we were dating.
@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash Yeah  I avoid the what in pretty much all non-work situations.
@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash "I've been struggling with this thing that is tedious and hard  but now I've figured out a good solution"
@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash I'd bet they do care and can understand the "how"  if not the "what".
@laurawatkins_ @michelle_lmc "We invited several but they were all busy"
@michelle_lmc (Saw the meeting name downstream -- sorry for lack of due diligence)
@michelle_lmc Can I ask what meeting? Also  men should consider boycotting as well.
@galaxyhistorian @astronomolly @jbprime Resolution won't be as good  unfortunately!
@mcnees 😮
@mcnees Ok fine. I'll just be over here figuring out how I can see it again tomorrow.
@mcnees There was a nearly infinite number of ways they could have screwed it up AND THEY DIDNT!!!!!
@mcnees Same. Perfect.
@gwmck @Alex_Parker I was wondering if that was your R2  Grant!
@nhuntwalker I usually double or triple the crust recipe then freeze a bunch of dough circles so I can make more on a moments notice...
@mcnees @Summer_Ash She feeling better?
@Summer_Ash @mcnees For real!!!!
@jegpeek @astronomolly #HDST
@mcnees @orzelc I haven't seen the show  but there really isn't a whole lot of psychological depth to most characters in the book.
@astronomeara THAT SUIT!!!!!
@astrotweeps Neato!
@astrotweeps This is a gripping story!
@lukedones Bonkers. I'm old enough to remember when z=0.5 was high z. 10000 reasonable candidates at z&gt;4 was not what I expected to ever see
@astrokiwi @astrotweeps That is a terrific ritual!
@astronomeara I Dirac-delta'd it.
@13adh13 wth?
@sir_galahead @NolaTRedd @universetoday true dat
@masequeira1 yeah  nip it in the bud. Two of daughter's elem. teachers told class they hated math. Not helping.
@GruntledChalkie but I knew she could do all the skills he claimed she lacked.
@GruntledChalkie honestly  I'm not really sure what that means  curriculum-wise.
@GruntledChalkie at her old school in Minnesota  most of the kids were 2 to 3 years below the level they were supposed to be by 2nd grade.
@astrotweeps @astronobeads that is nice
@Nancy_A I miss the leaves turning color – any snow  yet?
@OtherOrbScience striking!!
@masequeira1 wow! Great party.
@DavidBflower ah  I get it. For a moment I envisioned you with an unfurled poster in your seat.
@DavidBflower @FlyDeltaA @KLM loose???
@masequeira1 wow  you are doing this birthday right! Felicitations!
@michealjroberts @astrofrog ha! That is the actual year I learned Fortran
@13adh13 yes  yes it is.
@13adh13 So  someone probably had to think up this fashion stunt in the first place.
@13adh13 is this real? From last night  or another time.
@JohnDebes thank you for finding this so fast.
@michael_w_busch @fossilfriendly @sondy unbelievably  10 percent of adults in Florida cannot vote for this reason
@sondy @karinsandstrom good luck! very interested in your experiences.
@NGC3314 lol me too
@cosmos4u ah.  Still  people are so mobile these days  especially in Florida.
@cosmos4u what  worse than Katrina?
@kevinschawinski @luca_fowler @vrooje @AnnaKWeigel I was just thinking the same thing!
@JayQPublic all right  I will keep this in case my Twitter gets flooded
@sondy I'm possibly willing. Pls email details.
@NGC3314 Yeah  right. I went through something similar for DPS.
@NGC3314 do you mean as a captcha?
@spacejammie @hauck But even there you can get it down to 20 hours/week. At R1 institutions  maybe it is only 5-10 hours of your time.
@spacejammie @hauck Well  it depends on where you go. A "Teaching institution" will have you working 20-40 hours/week on your courses.
@hauck @spacejammie Me  too. In the beginning I spent 6-8 hours prep for each hour of lecture. Oy!
@hauck @spacejammie Yes  but counting hours works for both types. I recommend that for clarity.
@hubbahubble @nytimes and I have been criticized at work for not speaking enough. Yet  often crickets or interrupting when I do talk.
@Paladin1969 @brianwolven lol
@brianwolven 👌
@brianwolven ah! Now I get it  unfortunately
@brianwolven I don't get it.
@kennicosmith good to know
@kennicosmith i'm going to try the grating frozen butter
@gravitate_to_me @jjfplanet somebody needs to go wake up Jonathan
@astronomeara not saying for now. But soon.
For those interested in what I did last week @astrotweeps  it's been put in 'storify' form  below: https://t.co/rbMqmc6wMC
@verbiscer Thank you  Anne!
@ArjaRoxe Thank you!
@verbiscer Thank you!
I probably won't be tweeting much here this week  because I'm hosting @astrotweeps til Sunday. Come join us there!
@gwmck @wkerslake ah. It's the "simultaneously" part that I missed. No  I don't them all at once. Very weird.
@wkerslake @gwmck I actually see all 12. Is this a joke?
@JohnDebes what is this?
@Rainmaker1973 I really like this - thanks for sharing it.
@cbellh47 nice work! Looks like the outburst is over and the comet is going back to normal
@cbellh47 thx
@cbellh47 Nice result  Charles. What do you estimate the magnitude to be right now?
@astronomeara  damn ear worm!
@Paleophile literally. Read my other tweets
@cbellh47 what is your estimated magnitude?
@cosmos4u @gabonn like something from Batman movie
@DrPhiltill which journal????
@DoctorZen @iGrrrl @drugmonkeyblog also  POs weigh programmatic balance  portfolio  geographic issues  and others. #NSFrotator
@cbellh47 thx. I'd like to know your mag estimate.
@cbellh47 are you really???? Hot dog.
@cbellh47 anymore obs of 174p?
@brianwolven @ObservatoryCats same
@outseide @waidr @noaliekate ??
@NGC3314 oh. I believe it.
@NGC3314 what is your guess?
Congratulations to Dr. Ophelia George for her successful dissertation defense today! #geosciences @USFResearch https://t.co/rX14gHtSqy
@samayanissanke @gravitate_to_me Ah  well  congrats for solving that problem!
@gravitate_to_me @samayanissanke (that I was PO for)
@gravitate_to_me @samayanissanke Ah  thanks. Now I wonder what happened to his NSF grant.
@gravitate_to_me @samayanissanke did he move? I thought he was at Colorado
@NGC3314 I find that standing in the shade helps  as my Celestial navigator father taught me
@aussiastronomer ugh
@SungrazerComets @StarkeyStardust what are our odds?
@brianwolven @asrivkin why am I not surprised?
@Paleophile our antenna is barely up to the challenge - $7 dealie from grocery store. So happy to pull in NBC #radioastronomer
@_hroe @PlanetDr @NewsfromScience yes  but I remember they were going to put out something more detailed in August or September
@PlanetDr I don't see a link  but email faith vilas to find out more fvilas@nsf.gov
@PlanetDr AFIK  it's the same as the AAG  but has no November 15 deadline.  I'll see if I can find a link.
@InvaderXan time for one of my fave cat pics: https://t.co/NNmVHmH0ce
@dizzheart @chicagotribune more like "wife wins medal"
@NGC3314 yes  you're correct about the beams. We did make lots of bizarre jokes on that job  though.
@sondy Sorry! soldier on
@Pharaoness I must have studied for it wrong - there were no strawberries involved
@JohnDebes @startorialist @LandsEnd so did my daughter until she could read
@JLGalache @billclinton @HillaryClinton sick of this
@firejohn78 both
@CyborgN8VMari oh  the power
@shannonmstirone @sondy btdt
@VealSlab okay thx
@JohnDebes @BenneHolwerda I always vote
@JohnDebes @BenneHolwerda regardless  I think it's important to educate whenever possible
@JohnDebes @BenneHolwerda Florida is not one of those states  however
@JohnDebes @BenneHolwerda yes it's strange to live in an area that is dominated by one party. Temptation is not to vote.
@JohnDebes  what's the dilemma? You're allowed to have opinions
@algi80 I got everything else  but was missing the Roman empire analogy. Srsly hoping for Clinton win here.
@algi80 ?
@gnorth @pugmum1 I'm there!
@masequeira1 wondering the same thing...
@merrdiff @KyleCranmer this is really cool - I'm glad you summarized everything.
@lukedones @astromarkmarley Everyone knows that Friday afternoon is always saved for the best.
@godFreeWorld great! How much practicing/playing in typical week?
@JamesVanFleet @CBSNews @winknews omg no! What's the rest of this story?
@asrivkin @brianwolven ok phew. Hope to see these tonight back at the hotel
@brianwolven @asrivkin are some of these not safe for anything? Let me know
@NGC3314 agreed
@erinleeryan @PlanetTreky yup
@hauck ooh I love the headwaters
@sondy Hmm  maybe add some salts/gatorade-type-stuff? Maybe just go home and rest. I hope you're feeling better soon.
@sondy Are you dehydrated?
@jacobrichardson thank you for telling me what that is!
@JacquelynGill woot! here are some more 'Congratulations' for you!
@JacquelynGill hooray! What agency?
@kat_volk @NolaTRedd Having been there last year  I suspect texting-while-touristing.
@AliumBritt @merrdiff lol  right! not really  oh well
@AliumBritt @merrdiff at least they are still spherical  right? 😀
@lukedones Sounds obscene. &amp; looks like it might get Tallahassee more than Tampa. Already sopping wet here
@JohnDebes uggggggh  that's awful
@JacquelynGill @emilylurice does not surprise me
@asrivkin @astrotweeps oh! I didn't know that. Haven't been there this week. Off to catch up.
@cpm5280 nice!
@sondy sounds horrible. Reminiscent of my daughter's previous experience w/nut allergy - epipens  etc. I hope you have what you need now.
@sondy ugh!
@PBarmby @mcnees @physicsmatt just wondering. Someone I told showed me that Wikipedia changed it back to 'alive' so it was confusing
@physicsmatt thank you
@Juan_Kinda_Guy @physicsmatt Wikipedia is waffling on this. Earlier today it was reversed.
@physicsmatt thank you  I couldn't find it
@physicsmatt link/proof?
@mcnees thank you!
@PeterDEdmonds @RetractionWatch @charlicarpenter this one leaves out the ever popular never introducing her at all.
@PeterDEdmonds @HuffPostWomen I think this kind of satire does more harm than good.
@kevinschawinski @keckobservatory yep! I never drink coffee until the Hale-Bopp perihelion year
@godFreeWorld I used to live there #gradschooldays
@godFreeWorld jealous. Where?
@David_A_Cocklin @themagster3 great job!
@tomkerss 30s=old age? Oy
@danfalk about your "supposedly" – is this is too good to be true?
@asrivkin @brianwolven @Valgren6 @HopeJahren Those are deadly. I had to have an intervention once  years ago.
@DrPhiltill I still like it
@DrPhiltill I always loved that phrase -"mass wasting"
@JohnDebes @jfaherty okay  I was afraid there  for a sec
@JohnDebes @jfaherty was?
@AmandaFreise really? What are you using?
@lukedones I just want to read the science!!
@emcconover @airandspace I really do not enjoy that museum
@Paladin1969 @starwars @noaliekate very sad!
@CyborgN8VMari no  not on mute. Pls carry on.
@MCNebrewla @merrdiff try asking to have them waived.
@merrdiff @MCNebrewla yes. True.  Although I do know academics who have paid for this out of their own pocket.
@MCNebrewla @merrdiff wait til you go to publish it in journals #itgetsworse
@Astroguyz barely there = time wasting. In that case I work on something else instead
@AscendingNode I have pre1998  but what are you looking for?
@DrShepherd2013 @sagesteele mine too  enjoy!
@masequeira1 @mcnees saving to watch later.
@gnorth @JohnRMoffitt @maximaxoo @marsrader @StarChild_100 @loretobgude @DeepStuff omg is it Friday again?
@DrJoVian @StellarPlanet you can do fax over computer. Btw
@biphenyl mine too!
@RichardFPenn yes  that was a kind of experiment in itself
@kevinschawinski @HIgalaxies how far are the galaxies roughly  z?
@kevinschawinski @HIgalaxies are those ripply things artifacts?
@Pharaoness that's exactly what I said about Ryden's book. None of my students would red the foot notes!
@masequeira1 @mlmarshall13 As an older introvert  I tell you that this continues  but points replaced by assignments  promotions...
@dvcotton @ArjaRoxe I dunno- in one case the person is afraid of being raped/killed. #notthesame
@lukedones @LokiVolcano i'm guessing that's a beer joke.😄
@kgusler @sarahcoll_14 @zipthepip @cherrylkd @MichaelJewell78 @Smith83K @frankidemerle @ptgelci Wow  I had no idea this was Fri. until this.
@sondy It's tweets like these that confuse me - I keep thinking you already have your doctorate....
@sondy @lukedones ps. you're not a fool.
@sondy @lukedones well  maybe I'm wrong about .asc.
@lukedones @sondy oooh  that's really bad
@lukedones @sondy Isn't that just ascii??? plain text  I mean?
@sondy does Kurucz go that low? https://t.co/Bdh9KWWugo
@PeterDEdmonds @marynmck @MIT I really think this is pervasive - not just at MIT
@CyborgN8VMari that is really deep
@sondy your profile pic is great! Where was it taken?
@JohnDebes please go on ....
@lukedones @BadassoftheWeek @JarodAnderson woot!  Looks like the one in my backyard
@Robotbeat @caorann9 @NativeApprops -understood you  so let it go. Now I see that is what you meant. I disagree w/u.
@Robotbeat @caorann9 @NativeApprops Chris  your 1st reply seemed to put cult app in a positive light  or at least neutral. I thought I mis-
@RichardFPenn I know. But think of a painful memory  and imagine your brain refusing to "go there" anymore
@RichardFPenn seems like my brain has learned to screen out particular things over the years
@CyborgN8VMari heart-breaking
@R_Trotta yes  for real &amp; I've got to go.  Lofoten Isl in Norway. It's not mine. I have no idea where it came from - seen it all my life.
@StarzanPlanets totally forgot to include her Twitter handle @starstryder
@starstryder @twenty3eighty4 congratulations!
@asrivkin @astro_Liz @KalunaHeather @pyroxena @HiCommander @CarlyHowett That would be fun  I'll think about it.
@ahenk75 @AlanStern I hadn't heard about the Star Trek test before
@john1966olsen happy weekend to you too!
@john1966olsen i'm quite safe. I took the picture through my binoculars ￼
@FODcdn @SkyandTelescope @fauxtaographer how can you not be impressed by Saturn?
@FODcdn @SkyandTelescope @fauxtaographer its up in the daytime frequently
@JohnDebes #mariaisjealous
@lukedones @nick_attree @elakdawalla @AlanStern @verge the Chiron's going to be my fave car now
@verbiscer @elakdawalla yes  now I remember *that* ring  but had forgotten the name of the moon assoc w/it. My bad. Thx!
@verbiscer @elakdawalla ?
@elakdawalla @lukedones verry interesting
@masequeira1 what is the real fluff?
@gnorth Was ist das?
@jacobrichardson @USFResearch it's crazy. The lighting wasn't the greatest for pics  so I had to overly lighten the bkgd to see your faces
@masequeira1 of course  you're welcome. But thank you for running with it.
@masequeira1 @mcnees You're great at this. I'm so glad you wrote it up and put it on a blog &amp; that it's getting attention
Congratulations to new PhD @jacobrichardson ! From @USFResearch #VolcanoesonMars https://t.co/hcNtjDqKz5
@masequeira1 Fantastic job  Mark!
@CyborgN8VMari Now I have to start over again w/friends in this town
@CyborgN8VMari She said shd have been done slowly  over time  in a non-disruptive way. wth. She's very liberal  progressive  this threw me
@TristinaWright @CyborgN8VMari Sadly  I learned a few weeks ago that someone I used to consider a friend believes this.
@CyborgN8VMari @SignyTheSage Good (I think)
@LarsTheWanderer @NASAWatch lol.  I'm guessing it was on his bucket list to do before the year was up
@CyborgN8VMari omg r u ok?
@astromarkmarley @lukedones trust?? Seriously? Wow I'm impressed
@lukedones @astromarkmarley Okay  now I feel like I'm watching bizarro episode of Jeopardy
@masequeira1 this is a really good idea. I'm so glad you're doing it
@masequeira1 omigosh how exciting!!! Seeeee - this will be great visibility for the students' work. Pls let me know when it's up.
@maximaxoo @gnorth @JohnRMoffitt @loretobgude @fcain Nice!
@VergaraLautaro @skdh great  saving for later :)

@ArjaRoxe ooh thank you. Here's a piece for you .....
@ArjaRoxe it was so easy to make
@lukedones @AlsBoy so  like a week before your next deadline?
@lukedones @AlsBoy I can't help it – that video has pushed me to infinity and beyond
@NightSkyPark @VergaraLautaro they are very popular!
@mommascientist pls tweet the science
@erinleeryan @LarsTheWanderer @lukedones @astroprofhoff or maybe this one instead https://t.co/EQuukk0AqT
@erinleeryan @LarsTheWanderer @lukedones @astroprofhoff hey - reveal/announcement cakes are already a thing https://t.co/tF9TfT6Qdl
@upulie no they are actually doing something different. I'll try to find a better article
#GravitationalWaves ripple through social media - story highlights tweets from many I know on Twitter https://t.co/PhFxCAOCKB via @dwnews
@astronomeara happy birthday to you  too!
So  in effect  @DrMLHarris of @PhysicsWorld says don't worry so much about the cake picture of #LIGO announcement... https://t.co/tp8wk03ID0
@RachelFeltman @kimberlykowal So wait - was the bakery instructed to keep the embargo?
@lukedones yes  me too!
@BlackPhysicists @mcnees okay.... Thx
@masequeira1 my hair is clean and soft  so works for me. Totally nerdy
.@BlackPhysicists @MIT well it feels pretty clean to me
@JayQPublic not precipitation
@phalpern In Tallahassee - I know the one. I didn't know he had another.
@GruntledChalkie not without coffee!
@GruntledChalkie Oh  okay. You say it like you think it's easy or something.
@timmermansr Ooooh.  There are parts of Minnesota I miss and we were thinking of taking a winter vacation like that next year. Gotta link?
@timmermansr What kind of trip/vacation are you taking? Where  what  when  how? Looks great.
If you're not already following @astrotweeps and @astromarkmarley  start now #astronomyfun #exoplanets #solarsystem https://t.co/Oj45Jyhdad
@astrotweeps good! I found this confusing when I was at NSF.  I remember asking someone to name their model  don't remember who it was
@masequeira1 I actually like the snow and if it's not too cold. But not 20 below
@masequeira1 well I paid my dues with 14 Minnesota winters
@masequeira1 we had A week or two where the highs climbed only into the 60s!  In hindsight  it was winter
@StellarPlanet @DrJoVian you know we want to see it  though
@erickstephen @FOX13News @BN9 ugh. Hate this. I'm glad it's over
.@FOX13News Kids at King now being told that #KingHighSchool lockdown is over.
@erickstephen @FOX13News @BN9 I got a robocall saying it was only modified lockdown
.@StellarPlanet yes  I didn't know what to make of the pulsar planets a few years before  but w/51 Peg  I thought "ok  this is serious."
@StellarPlanet I do remember  talking about the exoplanet discoveries in my first astronomy courses at Penn State Erie  as new prof.
@solarstellar @StellarPlanet me  too!
@Paleophile It's not unbelievable  just stupid. Especially because  oh well  never mind.
@Paleophile Yes  let's!
@kevinmgill @LEGO_Group Holy animation  Batman! Well done.
@CyborgN8VMari I totally get this and am facing similar struggle
@Nancy_A Yeah  and I think Pi is too long  too. Ask them to shorten it.
@masequeira1 Yes and apparently a 'botox brow' as the article explains. Hmmm.
@masequeira1 omg don't even get me started. Hugs come rarely these days  maybe even seasonally.
@JacquelynGill I wish I'd have thought of that answer....
@megschwamb great  thanks for the link.
@megschwamb Psl post a 'cheat sheet' of your talk.
@masequeira1 yes  exactly!
@lukedones uh-oh
@astrokatey I like how you can just report to NSF instead of depending on the institution's title 9 office. Still  we will see.
@lukedones oh no  then that really is crazy
@astrokatey but will they? It'll be interesting to see agencies enforce this.
@lukedones I hope you weren't texting/twittering
@DrPhiltill @AlanStern @NewHorizons2015 yes  I did  actually
@boundangle I don't know  probably numbered in order discovered  but am not going to worry about it  actually.
@ProfChrisWelch thx  new word for me.
@ProfChrisWelch what does the namechecked mean?
@john1966olsen happy weekend to you  too!
.@SungrazerComets @sandygrains Of course  if confirmed  it should really be called "Planet 9 form Outer Space"
@SungrazerComets @sandygrains lol! (but no!)
@LCTTA @SungrazerComets Yes  indeed!
@masequeira1 same here. But we have a few weeks to do this
@erinleeryan @lukedones @barbylon so where you going?
@TrueSciPhi sounds about right
@sondy thanks for writing that. I wish I could help more than I am.
@Paladin1969 @bertrandom Ah  you were more of an engineer  then?
@masequeira1 Sadly  no it's too big for cheesecake. But perhaps I should test that.
@Mario_Livio @LIGO These rumors of rumors are getting annoying.
@boundangle yes  I remember that. I always hated the name
@dvcotton @ArjaRoxe Yeah  and anyway  the pattern to deal with is the abuse  not the trigger.
@dvcotton @ArjaRoxe And  yes  it's hard to recognize it in self  but well worth the time it takes.
@dvcotton @ArjaRoxe I assume you're referring to Ott. If so  I also read complaints from men  unrelated to unrequited love.
.@dvcotton @lizstrahle @ArjaRoxe Mainly  I think people should learn to recognize &amp; deal with abusive/controlling behavior in self &amp; others.
@ArjaRoxe @dvcotton Some may call it old-fashioned  but it's just having good boundaries.
@ArjaRoxe That’s not old-fashioned. :)
@ArjaRoxe @dvcotton antiquated?
.@dvcotton @ArjaRoxe these problems arise from issues of control/power  not from romantic feelings. People shld educate themselves abt abuse
Heart doctors outraged Florida dumps hospital standards after big gifts to GOP @CNN https://t.co/xIq7n5LzQO
@masequeira1 okay  I see. Grim plan
@masequeira1 what is a designated survivor
@CathRn111 @STEMJeff That's really awful  but promising that experienced teachers are better
@Gizmodo @jeremythomas33 good timing – Just as my teenage daughter learns to drive
@DrMRFrancis tip: use transcribing software for most of it
@awgonnerman yes looked dead
@JayQPublic no I wouldn't think so
@DrMRFrancis Thanks  I've seen that done before
@DrMRFrancis Am I missing something - is this a new request?
@dssearcher2 lol makes you wonder
@erinleeryan @sondy thx Erin!
Want to go to grad school in planetary science? Here's a good resource/tool from AAS DPS  https://t.co/BhP3GXdNEU  @sondy @DPSCommittee
@sondy NSF is easy to search  but NASA harder. Funding also usually/sometimes acknowledged in papers  meeting abstracts.
@sondy Also look at DPS  AGU  LPSC abstracts for universities.
@sondy Well  always in motion  the future (and funding) is  but she/he should look at who is being funded in the areas of interest.
@sondy There's lots more.  But are you talking about astronomy  plan sci  geology  chem  physics? What kind of program?
@lukedones @PeterDEdmonds Thanks  Luke!
@PeterDEdmonds Who is the astronomy person?
@AstroKatie @DrMRFrancis @blakestacey he was the highlight of the movie to my 14 yo dtr
@DrMRFrancis @hpcprogrammer New year near winter solstice makes more sense to me. Kind of like a new Moon starting out of darkness
@gwmck no kidding
@DrMRFrancis stop - you're ruining my Sunday
@SungrazerComets whoa!
@gwmck uh oh I hope that's good
@merrdiff Macys does
@DrMRFrancis @merrdiff this is why I hate seeing Marie Curie as a role model
@Astroguyz Yep!
@NGC3314 I hate when that happens. It's always a good idea to insert a relevant nonsense word to make files easier to find later #lifehack
@Paladin1969 me  too!!
@startorialist thanks for letting me know
@Paladin1969 yay - enjoy
@gnorth you betcha!
@telescoper @GeertHub pic missing
@radjanirad @theAGU it is awesome
@astrotweeps thank you!
@awgonnerman how old is he?
@Wikisteff @OtherOrbScience indeed
@kevinschawinski I may have to mute you for a few days
@kevinschawinski geesh. I know.
@kevinschawinski cool. I'm not going until next Tuesday
@kevinschawinski when you going?
@cathomas09 evidently  lots of people are looking past the test scores  since the U.S. prize fellows also got in somewhere....
.@PeterDEdmonds @NatureComms I concluded public accountability explains  a lot with peer review recommendations
@astronomeara @NatureComms pilot?
@RiAus I can only dream of such an honour!
@PlasmaNerd @realscientists OK  well my advice would be to trust yourself and know that you are an expert. Be confident and enjoy!
@PlasmaNerd @realscientists Why would you think that?
@PlasmaNerd @realscientists Journalists have very short deadlines  that's the nature of the job. Sometimes less than an hour to write.
@PlasmaNerd @realscientists why is that  if you don't mind me asking?
@realscientists @PlasmaNerd in my experience no  journalists need info on specific stories within the hour  not general info occasionally.
@Astrophiz Would love to! Let's talk.
Fed up with politics? Watch @astroduff talking with @ProfBrianCox on @RiAus about physics. Fantastic stuff! https://t.co/sd0NVrucyF
@BlackPhysicists @Helen_E_MC I don't live in South Australia. It's one of the less populous states of australia.
@BlackPhysicists @Helen_E_MC People might be better off if they use evidence more and opinion less.
@AunatEridu @astroduff Yep. I actually took part in a survey for this article.
@pauldutton1968 @AAOastro *nobody move. They only detect motion*
@gravitate_to_me Oh  very cool.  How long until we can probe IMBH mergers via GWs?

@BenneHolwerda @SCTrager @astronomolly @Harcel @mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 fvour-wearrrrrrrrrrrp then. Simple.
@mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 @BenneHolwerda emphasis on 'four'
@mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 @BenneHolwerda four-werp.
@jsalsman @AstroKatie @PeterCawdron and what is the consequence of this?
@Nightskyonline @perthobs lol. No air in space doesn't mean you can't get irradiated to death!
@Nightskyonline @perthobs this is assuming you have an atmosphere and benchmarking off a familiar situation (a home heater). ...
@Nightskyonline @perthobs at 150 km  you could have 2 x 10^10 times the power of a home heater and still be OK. Sand grain is 10^20 x power
@Nightskyonline @perthobs A home heater is ~500W. You'd sit about a metre from it and be OK. Extend that to 150 km &amp; heat spreads over 1/r^2
@Nightskyonline @perthobs is it by radiant heat  or by heating an assumed volume of air surrounding it?
@Nightskyonline @perthobs Still not sure exactly how that kills a person. Ideas?
@Nightskyonline @perthobs So the total power radiated in all directions by the sand grain is 6 x 10^22 Watts.
@Nightskyonline @perthobs Surface area of a medium sand grain is 4 x pi x r^2 with a radius of 250 microns  this area is 7.8 x 10^-7 m^2.
@Nightskyonline @perthobs Energy = 2.87 x 10^21 W/square metre
@Nightskyonline @perthobs Start with Stefan's Law: Energy = sigma x T^4 where sigma is stefan's constant.
@Nightskyonline @perthobs Not sure what assumptions are. Radiant heat from a 15 million degree sand grain?
@perthobs @Nightskyonline how?
Talking space at Leichhardt School - such clever questions! @CSIROSMiS @Aus_ScienceWeek #NatSciWk #5ScientistPledge https://t.co/3kDxxd6Veu

@Thinking__Cat @SKA_telescope @SYD_astrofest I did the @WorldSciFest in Brisbane a couple of months ago and I'm sure there will be others.
@amyekimball @naomimcgriff and therein lies the problem. You don't feel safe.
@amyekimball @naomimcgriff dude  come on. Anti sodomy laws are anti lgbti laws. Threat of five years in prison is not 'family friendly'
@amyekimball @naomimcgriff that page says five years in prison. Sodomy laws are deliberately targeted against gay men.
Had a great evening at @MacAstroSoc  speaking about black holes and colliding galaxies. Thanks all! https://t.co/oiqTCyixcP
@Aus_ScienceWeek @questacon @SKA_Australia @SNAICC Yep - they will be in the audience. Definitely talk abt that.
@Aus_ScienceWeek @questacon @SKA_Australia @SNAICC :-)

@drannawatts @jr_pritchard @SpaceSchoolUK Wow  yes. I will never forget that. @SpaceSchoolUK was fantastic.
@astronomyblog Well said!
@RiAus In the first 5 years  about ten thousand. 100 currently known. (I'm referring to colliding galaxies that emit 'megamasers')
@RiAus I'm calculating the number of molecular signals from colliding galaxies that we will find with our new radio telescope  ASKAP.
@tracy_karin Great idea! ..and wait until my online astronomy courses launch  that'll give people something to do on those cloudy nights!

@BlackPhysicists No  it's not a high-tech affair I'm afraid. You'll have to imagine.
@AstroExeter @AstroKatie @DoctorKarl @Sharpie081 @sylmobile Look forward to seeing you there @AstroExeter !
@AussiePhinatic @DoctorKarl @sylmobile @Sharpie081 I understand it will be recorded by @UNSWPhysics and put on their YouTube channel.
@BlackPhysicists @SciBry There are some plans to develop citizen science for SKA (currently the pathfinders). @radiogalaxyzoo is great.
@BlackPhysicists @SciBry Sounds like a good idea. Are these chats on twitter?

@BlackPhysicists @daandutoit @ComradesRace I am running! http://t.co/xClJnYka9c
@AunatEridu @SKA_telescope @CSIROnews The CSIRO Science Operations Centre at Marsfield headquarters. Remotely operate Parkes  ATCA  ASKAP.
@jegpeek @Arsenal Awesome!
@Science_Academy @USCAR_ surname?
@AunatEridu I'll take that! :-)
@AunatEridu No  London doesn't have entry qualifications. It's just massively over-subscribed. You have to enter a lottery to get a place.
@AunatEridu Oh yeah  sounds like a great event. Really dream of London Marathon though. I can never get an entry.
@AunatEridu Are you asking if I am running Boston? If so  then no.
@BlackPhysicists Bit of both. We cross soft sand dunes  including 'big red'  Australia's highest. We also cross gibber plains and salt lakes
Congratulations to the new Fellows of Australian Academy of Sciences. A fine bunch of recipients! http://t.co/nxUaTqLaER @Science_Academy
@Aus_ScienceWeek looks like I am describing a basketball!
@Aus_ScienceWeek I look fed up on this photo - but actually I had a great time!
@42jkb @ScienceAU Hey Julie - great to see you!
@RoyalAstroSoc responds forcefully to @MailOnline's shameful treatment of Maggie Aderin-Pocock &amp; Hiranya Peiris https://t.co/UD4R2HPAIh
@jen_gupta at what distance?
@gravitate_to_me thanks for the RT!
@NASAhistory @matisidro or you could have said Caroline Herschel  astronomer.... But instead you hinged her achievements on her brother.
@Helen_E_MC ditto! Normally Hate early starts but running in the blueys is worth it! Enjoy
@reneehlozek Don't be a pessimist. The past was more intolerant and more warlike.  Long way to go but the future is bright.
@ProfMike_M Looking forward to seeing it
@jegpeek @dalcantonJD To paraphrase Rosenblatt: the act of reading tweets  is a unique experience and your view is valid as any other
@jason__rhodes @Planck @Caltech How would we be able to collect on the bet?  This isn't science.
Has the LHC seen new physics?   @physicsmatt on the search. https://t.co/flO4FPKyX2
@jegpeek Wow!  That makes these talks worth giving
@albertoconti Thanks!  Fun to think about the potential power of WFIRST for astrometry.  GAIA should be great!
@aagie I also thought that we would discover the dark matter by now.
@shaka_lulu @ClimateOfGavin Dyson will often admit to climate change  but argue that the mitigation costs should be put off until later.
@jbprime @JossBlandHawtho Congratulations!
@adam_m_jcbs @StartsWithABang Please apply!
@ProfMike_M go for it... I am going back to sleep.. Very early in New Jersey
@ProfMike_M the gamma rays bursts would be the smoking gun
@ProfMike_M the deep drops in the stars brightness implies that a very large comet abundance. These are killer comets
@ProfMike_M maybe the comets killed the aliens?
@lukedones @cosmos4u Good paper on whether planets of this size are rocky: http://t.co/8yV7fUNSJe
@lukedones @cosmos4u Depends on its true mass
@cosmos4u The properties of these massive rocky planets are not well understood.  Do they have plate tectonics? Thick atmospheres?
@cosmos4u At 5 earth masses  it is likely rocky and it should have Earth-like effective temperatures.
@cosmos4u This 3-&gt;2 idea is generating interest and some criticism (see http://t.co/UjF2KSSLrE)
@jbprime This article shows a misunderstanding of economics.  More supply means lower cost.
@dalcantonJD @AstroKatie @reneehlozek Julianne- you have always had a fondness for dwarf objects...
@AstroKatie @reneehlozek Most everything and everyone I love is smaller than Pluto.
@AstroKatie @reneehlozek I will take Eris in a fight with Pluto
@AstroKatie @reneehlozek IAU is still right... pluto is a dwarf.
@lukedones @reneehlozek You  are right  but they are both dwarfs.  Don't let Stern reclassify Pluto
@reneehlozek Eris is bigger! #sizematters #plutoisadwarf
@reneehlozek Did it happen now or in 4 hours?  All depends on your slicing of spacetime
@reneehlozek Blinding reduces "confirmation bias" but often reduces ability to study foregrounds.  Useful but no panacea.
@reneehlozek @Perimeter When we don't understand a number  we have a chance to learn something profound.  Fine-tuning misses the opportunity
@AstroKatie @reneehlozek CMB acoustic fluctuations are 80 sigma detections of dark matter and probe lots of its properties.
@StartsWithABang Agreed but if it is too low  we may never see it
@RobertGaristo No   In the 1980s  most astronomers (and the data) favored Omega = 0.2-0.3.  This once was an argument against inflation.
@sasharahlin @reneehlozek We all make up theory as we go along...
@reneehlozek but we were right about l=1800 and systematics in the autocorrelations
@david_hurn @nytimes The prediction of the existence of the neutrino spurred physicists to look for ways to detect it
@thomaszurbuchen cmb data  large scale structure and Lensing data provide very strong independent evidence consistent with sn data
@astronomeara YES!  Especially given the LIthium mystery!  What are prospects?
@jegpeek Twitter was very useful to communicate doubts at a time when everyone was sure BICEP2 was correct.
@jegpeek Still need to write my lecture  so am going to wait read the papers  and think about it.
@shaka_lulu @jradavenport download it to your ipad
@brant_robertson @reneehlozek They presented two results (WMAP EE cleaned with 353) and (LFI EE cleaned with 353).
@brant_robertson @reneehlozek I have heard that the lower tau was presented at the Ferrara meeting but wasn't there.
@chris_tibbs @DrDa5id Misread the ESA web page clock.  Landing is today!
@robcarrphoto @Matt_Burleigh In the picture  why does the X-ray move at an angle relative to the Axion?
@RichardFPenn @LeeBillings Axions convert to x-rays in the B field.  X-rays should be moving away from the Sun.
@reneehlozek If you never miss a train  you are getting to the station too early
@JossBlandHawtho @jbprime So far  the media has portrayed this as "watching the sausage being made".
@jegpeek fun talking...hope you thrive in baltimore
@reneehlozek  or good day care
@astrojohnjohn @reneehlozek @niais @berkeleyjess @BuChanda
@DrMRFrancis @DudeDarkmatter @btucker22 @BadAstronomer @astroduff   H0 in the local patch  could differ by ~5% from global value
@DudeDarkmatter @btucker22 @DrMRFrancis @BadAstronomer @astroduff Still think that there are problems with Planck 217 GHz.  Pushes H0 to 68.
@reneehlozek say hi to eiichiro
@R_Trotta I agree  but that is not the motivation for the human program.  NASA science mission spends about 5 B/yr- HST  Mars  US Planck .
@shaka_lulu Made the Washington Post article
@shaka_lulu You will need to ask about schmutz in the questions.  I am mostly going to be talking about the work on oscillations with Daan.
@peterdedmonds See you in Boston-- hope to comment on gravitational waves in the Kavli talk -- will talk about two epochs of acceleration
@peterdedmonds  working on the paper now
@cosmos4u @seanmcarroll yes.  if the foregrounds are near the minimal case  r  is around 0.1
@jbprime As Nancy Reagan taught us  just say no!
@reneehlozek  Yet you seem to function...
@reneehlozek Yet you see to function
@ckmcbride @peterdedmonds @seanmcarroll @AstroKatie The polarization signal is very weak.  Intensity signal could leak.
@peterdedmonds @seanmcarroll In the midst of a crazy trip so would be hard to do. @AstroKatie would do a good job of writing something!
@cosmos4u @AstroKatie @StartsWithABang  Potentially revolutionary result.  Important to think about  also important to check.
@DrMRFrancis @arstechnica Sorry -- just catching up
@jegpeek @astrotweeps @reneehlozek There are features in the plots that look worrying.
@jegpeek @astrotweeps @reneehlozek   They are definitely seeing a signal.  Need to read the paper more carefully to see if it is CMB.
@peterdedmonds @partialobs   Important if true
@peterdedmonds @partialobs   Skiing with Eiichiro Komatsu
@peterdedmonds @partialobs  Fun visit to Munich!  Tomorrow  I head to the Alps Watch for an interesting CMB announcement on Monday
@jegpeek @dalcantonJD  See  http://t.co/obEDIWtJIE  The slides from the presentation at NAS not yet on-line.  Probably tomorrow morning.
@jegpeek High escape fraction at high z helps a lot
@aagie Super Bowl is in Jersey not NYC.  Other side of the GWB! Christie is promising to not close lanes today
@sondy Wow. That’s some exquisite gaslighting right there.
@Astro_JohnCF @PenguinGalaxy  There are also 2 other videos (I’m going to share them too  eventually) at https://t.co/2lKGlawSzF
@kevinschawinski I admire that you think this is the bottom.
@robertcnichol it's the SDSS ID - bit ridiculous to read but easy to use it to look up tons of info :)
@DrRob_Thacker Thanks! No worries  it’s worth it. Looks great. Safe flights! @startorialist @emilylurice @zazzle @PeterDEdmonds
@DrRob_Thacker That would be amazing! :) @startorialist @emilylurice @zazzle @PeterDEdmonds
@HughO2 @StellarPlanet I feel like it’s less about the observing runs (remote/queue is common now) and more about the conference travel.
@startorialist Are these for sale? I have a gift recipient in mind! @emilylurice @zazzle @DrRob_Thacker @PeterDEdmonds
@astronomyblog *hugs*
@reneehlozek Just. Why would she do that. I kept looking for some kind of self-awareness or white-feminist parody  but  no.
@niais @jegpeek @sarahkendrew  Eeeexcellent. https://t.co/fgs7U6vlwn
@niais @jegpeek @sarahkendrew  Me too! I went to sign up last month and then went “oh I need to know what to talk/unconference about. Hmm."
@PeterDEdmonds yes. It and "crazy" have been used a few times at various points in talks.
@StellarBones @kevinschawinski It really is.
@kevinschawinski I nominate @StellarBones.
@kevinschawinski A MNRAS editor told me Gmail changed its header requirements to be much more strict &amp; MNRAS doesn’t seem to comply.
@kevinschawinski Yes  due to Gmail forwarding issues. Workaround: put your direct Gmail address as a cc in MNRAS account profile.
@realscientists For concentration while writing  Ravel’s Bolero puts me in the zone. Then a playlist entitled “no words  not boring”.
@realscientists First step is giving myself time to think about a proposal &amp; not shaming myself if that takes days before I start writing.
@realscientists I am enjoying reading these replies but constantly doing double-take because in my field SLAC is also a Lab at Stanford.
@astrobellatrix @astrogrant Ooh  and slides 15 &amp; 16 too... this data is just gorgeous!
I have been meaning to ask @astrogrant @astrobellatrix is any of the CARS targets are disk-dominated galaxies. #EinsteinFellows
@PeterDEdmonds thank you!
.@cosmos4u I waived the @HubbleTelescope proprietary period. My proposal was made possible by @galaxyzoo volunteers; all should have access.
@brendonbrewer What’re you betting? 😉
@jen_gupta @chrislintott +1
@mikamckinnon @sarahkendrew @TCRatius +a look at our timelines shows we each post on many topics. Discussion ok  topic policing not so much.
@TCRatius @sarahkendrew @mikamckinnon even if you'd said "y'all" I'd still have replied in the same way. Research/exploration has value.
@TCRatius @sarahkendrew @mikamckinnon I don't see the logic in the suggestion that we "gals" should only discuss topics you approve of.
@astrokatey it'll get worse if it helps their profit margins. Everything is broken.
@hormiga @EvoPhD @RallidaeRule @kejames @ExpatScientist @WhySharksMatter Most ✅ men I know verified w/o request; not so for non-men I know.
@kejames it was weeks. Can't recall exactly how many  but long enough that I started to wonder if the form send hadn't gone through.
@kevinschawinski don't underestimate the power of the dark side.
My #observing run  part 2: https://t.co/d5Jomo8Wiw incl. @psmithgb @see_the_sky @astropixie @davecl42 @LEMacKz @BlackPhysicists @kellecruz
My #observing run in 2 parts. Part 1: https://t.co/cU8To3ZL3I including @bradpholden @SCTrager @ScienceNelson @jps_astro @gravitate_to_me
@MasoomJethwa It’s optical slit spectra of galaxies - the images are generally zoomed in on H-alpha.
@kevinschawinski I guess maybe I should be storifying this? @luca_fowler @AnnaKWeigel
@BlackPhysicists I’m unfamiliar with this analogy though  so can’t help there. (Sorry)
@BlackPhysicists The dark matter halo (lots of mass) seems really important in disk &amp; bar evolution  but it’s hard to observe.
@BlackPhysicists In simulations  bars form extremely easily in a “cold” (rot-dominated) disk. But they’re not observed quite as often.
@BlackPhysicists This phrasing seems to assume that bar formation is inevitable in a disk - which is a really interesting research topic.
I was lucky to do my first #observing run with expert observer @megschwamb  whose level of care  alertness &amp; planning I still aspire to.
@BlackPhysicists By “settle” I mean dynamically: the orbits of stars &amp; gas become rotation-dominated &amp; lie in a thin plane. That takes time.
@BlackPhysicists Under simplifying assumptions  yes. In general a disk that hasn’t had time to “settle” will be stable against bar formation
@BlackPhysicists … and it constrains (in a complex way) the history the galaxy has had regarding interactions (or not) with other galaxies.
@BlackPhysicists It often implies there’s a younger population of stars (though there may also be much older stars)…
@NGC3314 It seems pretty awesome - this is my first sciencing with it though. (PS got any science you want to do next semester?)
@stoutde yep  night 2 of 2 for this run!
@stoutde Yeah  it is a bonus! Science being global means there’s a conversation to be had at all hours. :) Thanks!
@Astro_Adept They *claim* there’s no extension cord long enough. Pfft.
@stoutde I think the earth is trying to do that… bring some stuff in from the Pacific so those in the Rockies can ski!
@ScienceNelson Yay! Observing can feel like a really distanced space sometimes. I’m glad for Twitter. :)
@stoutde Someday! And our first priority will obviously be perfect conditions atop mountains that have observatories. 😀
@BlackPhysicists I’m at @LickObservatory  on Mount Hamilton  at the Shane 3m. The spectrograph is great so I really want to get some data!
@stoutde If the air suddenly dried up right now they’d still have to wait for wind to evaporate the dew  to avoid drips onto the mirror.
@stoutde The dew is all on the building exterior. When it’s this bad they won’t even open the dome for fear of damage like what you mention.
@stoutde Thanks! It happens. Bummer  but there’s always hope...
@kevinschawinski Tonight &amp; tomorrow for this run. Tomorrow’s forecast is not really any better.
@jr_pritchard @dalcantonJD @jbprime @acooray Maybe NASA could offer incentives for fellows to look beyond the Big Names.
@jr_pritchard @dalcantonJD @jbprime @acooray Isn't the increase in research-driven faculty at smaller schools also a landscape change?
@dalcantonJD @jbprime @acooray @jr_pritchard Gut reaction: this feels like people pulling the ladder up after they’ve climbed.
@dalcantonJD @jbprime @acooray @jr_pritchard Right. I’m uncomfortable with the conclusion that fewer postdocs should be given independence.
@jbprime @acooray @jr_pritchard @dalcantonJD Are there any postdocs in the room when this is being discussed?
@PenguinGalaxy @kevinschawinski alas I think they're all away :( have fun though! And at least you'll know you're not contagious.
@fringetracker @kevinschawinski It’s not entirely clear Rubin and Zwicky would have to share it but you’re Swiss so I’ll give it to you 😝
@astrobellatrix consistent with this finding. Sorry  not enough room to properly say all of Kepler is short term compared to this analysis.
@mggtTaylor Over here it’s National Coffee Day  which seems fitting… albeit not as fitting as National Space-Mission-Induced Adrenaline Day.
@kevinschawinski @Jeyhan @astrokatey Either there’s been serious post-vote backchannel chat or Congress is trying to have cake &amp; eat it too.
@kevinschawinski @jeyhan @astrokatey hmm  I didn’t really see this coming though: https://t.co/oUJlmzsbc7
@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew Again  the argument would be more convincing if it focused on student recruitment &amp; not all outreach funding.
@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew Wait  we’re talking about PhDs? I thought we were talking about lectureships &amp; other permanent jobs?
@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew @DrJoVian so perhaps the answer to your particular complaint is more &amp; broader outreach  +time.
@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew @DrJoVian another is to improve science literacy overall  which hopefully translates to more science funding.
@michealjroberts I admire your laser-like focus on this  but outreach is for other things too. Many of them have been mentioned already.
@michealjroberts @DrJoVian @sarahkendrew you don't seem to be hearing me/us about the link between funding for jobs &amp; outreach being dubious
@michealjroberts @DrJoVian @sarahkendrew "can afford" and "willing to afford" are completely different things.
@michealjroberts @DrJoVian @sarahkendrew we all want enough funding to support outreach &amp; all interested researchers. Also  I'd like a pony.
@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew this is based on the assumption that the current climate will be the future climate.
@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew it's shitty you've had bad experiences. But you've also been dismissive of others with years more experience.
@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew by "accept the diversity of opinion" do you actually mean "accept the opinion"? It sort of sounds like that.
@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew yes  funding isn't great  but that doesn't mean outreach to schools is a waste or should stop.
@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew I genuinely don't know anyone who does careers outreach who doesn't caution about academic job prospects.
@michealjroberts and if you want to be  you can actively request that training or go somewhere that offers it by default.
@michealjroberts people who want to be that kind of astronomer. It's not that nobody should be  it's that not everyone has to be.
@michealjroberts a valid argument  if you think a professorship is the only legitimate destination on the path of a trained scientist.
.@michealjroberts it's only a problem if your model for a modern astronomer is someone who knows the Vega mags of standard stars by heart.
@michealjroberts we are in the Big Survey era. I didn't go observing until the final year of my PhD. I know Professors who have never been.
@michealjroberts @NickAstronomer @DrJoVian no argument about high fees (in US that's only 1 year's worth of $$) but what slaughter  exactly?
Tune in to @astrotweeps @elakdawalla @mggtTaylor for the latest news on @ESA_Rosetta's final mission  from the cont… https://t.co/6Qhgty7VvH
@michealjroberts this whole argument implicitly agrees that only perm. academic positions give an MSc/PhD value. @NickAstronomer @DrJoVian
@NGC3314 Nnnooooooooooooo
@kevinschawinski Perhaps  but the veto was always doomed &amp; a failed veto costs a Pres at home. WH decided the overseas message was worth it.
@kevinschawinski I’m talking about the doomed veto. Its purpose is to let POTUS/WH say to the world that they tried.
@kevinschawinski Nah  this veto is optics.
@SuffolkNature @osuc_curator @AndrewNCassidy @morbidflight @galaxyzoo Try https://t.co/R4sEWcnq5N to build a project @the_zooniverse :)
@ProfMike_M Seems perfect for @BriefJournal.
@jen_gupta though smaller bulges are more likely to be pseudobulges (light less concentrated  more rotationally supported)  if that matters.
@jen_gupta no typical  no unrealistic. But if it's a spiral I suppose it should be small enough to see the arms :)
@IBJIYONGI @niais I for one am grateful for you “troublemakers”. But also I felt no pressure whatsoever to sign. @PlanetDr @berkeleyjess
@realscientists Unconferences are great! Need to be planned differently though. If not planning program  must carefully choose who attends.
@realscientists Conferences that revolve around acts of fitness: skiing  hiking  etc. - immediately puts disabled people in the “out” crowd.
@becky1505 I’m actively bringing @kevinschawinski @NGC3314 @BenneHolwerda into the circle of those who can make you sing Disney songs.
@becky1505 PS: Kalamazoo @kevinschawinski @NGC3314 @BenneHolwerda

@kejames Remember that thing where Google put together a bunch of tourism photos over years to see places evolve? I want to see that here!
@BenneHolwerda so I'm on the second floor @ snellius- where do I go now?
cc @margaretkosmala @AndreaWiggins @alicatzoo because due credit wouldn’t fit in the character limits of that tweet. https://t.co/twGRGcMJJI
@Summer_Ash @emilylurice @jegpeek Completely agreed. By “persistently” I definitely meant as a community  not that any 1 person must always.
@Summer_Ash @emilylurice @jegpeek (and in the latter case we call out any BS persistently  until it goes away)
@Summer_Ash @emilylurice @jegpeek “The Leavitt Space Telescope” - 👍. I think we either stop naming them after people  or women are ok to go.
@reneehlozek Unintentionally awesome feedback.
@ProfMike_M "laffable" was gold though.
@startorialist congrats!

@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @CitizenSciences @Jen_A_Smith1 we see differences between @the_zooniverse project demographics.
@erinleeryan @gsnarayan @GeertHub that is odd though  I think that setup has worked for me in the past with transparent PDFs.
@erinleeryan @gsnarayan @GeertHub can you save the pdf as png and compile with that? Becomes raster but should preserve alpha.

@ScienceNelson absolutely loved that book.
@merrdiff this happened to me too  in CA - it was so long ago I hadn't realized they'd still have the record!
@astrokatey I fully agree with your sentiments. Unrelated: I stay up late a lot. &lt;waves north&gt; Also I 💚 the fact that email goes to me.
@kejames YES  THIS. Public proposals always creep me out a bit  and the additional limelight-stealing aspect: double #nope.
@PenguinGalaxy wondering if @dalcantonJD's recent course is online anywhere.
@jen_gupta did you go with the one that resembles a diffraction grating then?
.@MichielJorissen @realscientists Yeah um maybe we could NOT promote the work of a notorious sexual harasser?
@tweetedhere @DrKevGuitar @realscientists I apologize for having not removed your mention.
@tweetedhere @DrKevGuitar @realscientists Thanks for going out of your way to tell me we are each responsible for our own reactions.
@tweetedhere @DrKevGuitar @realscientists As a female scientist I’ve heard that type of “yet” pretty often. Always well-meaning.
@tweetedhere @DrKevGuitar @realscientists I didn’t think it was meant as an insult. Nor did I think it was about a Hollywood stereotype.
@DrKevGuitar @tweetedhere @realscientists “strong yet believable” 😞
@kevinschawinski Volvos seem an odd starter choice  but safety first I guess?
@astrobellatrix plus routing number  maybe. It's easy to put together and easy for banks to read. There's no excuse.
@kevinschawinski @eilatg Those with the t-shirts now exchange wistful looks when they see each other on the street. 👕🐿🍸😀😐😞
@kevinschawinski I remember. Back when that show was still awesome.
@kevinschawinski Consider getting an account at my bank. They have no problems *sending* money abroad +they can cash checks with app photos.
@kevinschawinski Maybe the Swiss are trying to force the US to update their system.
@kevinschawinski When this started I was all “the Swiss are banking ninjas  so I’m sure they can navigate the antiquated US system.” #NOPE
@kevinschawinski This exemplifies why it’s taking so long for your system and my system to talk to one another.
@kevinschawinski Can you still deposit via photos of a check taken from within your banking app?
@kevinschawinski @LeoBurtscher #monsters16 There was another paper out recently that claimed similar: Mechtley+. Sample selection important!

@realscientists Let’s be a bit careful about implying someone isn’t a real scientist if they aren’t thinking about science 24/7.
@GeertHub @jradavenport For some reason this makes me want to keep sending basic code snippets and saying “ta-da! you’re welcome!” 😁🤓😎
@GeertHub At some point @jradavenport is going to lose patience and start shouting “I KNOW PANDAS I LOVE PANDAS TOO I ALREADY KNOW” …
@merrdiff So they have a problem with BlackLivesMatter  but not with the idea that black lives matter? Will they at least say the latter?
@merrdiff :( when is an *inappropriate* time for inclusivity? Also that’s not what this would be? It’s life &amp; death  not a party invitation.
@jen_gupta There’s really good theater  some good gigs  one of my friends does comedy in LA (@Rontowski).
@jen_gupta &amp; the chances of it all being within easy distance of where you stay is low  so pick an interesting neighborhood that’s ~central.
@jen_gupta :) There’s actually lots of cool stuff to do in LA but you often have to know where to look/be on mailing lists etc
@jen_gupta Leave LA?  No  seriously.  *sigh*  okay. Santa Monica? If you like that whole “beach” thing  or that “walkable town” thing...
@NGC3314 It’s an ESO survey - well spotted! Think I may have got the galactic center in one of them but not sure (not directly on center).
@DrMRFrancis @PlanetDr It uses more characters  though. We @the_zooniverse use “speaking of the Pope” (even when it’s not about the Pope).
@kevinschawinski yep  when I was in the UK. You’re now in a much better time zone to organize it than I… @cfroning @astronomolly @owning_ivy
@merrdiff @AstroKatie @planet4589 I guess that would have been clear as soon as they got the signal - sorry for asking instead of waiting :)
@AstroKatie @planet4589 @merrdiff right - so by “realtime” they mean earth time  not Jupiter time?

@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @grobertsborsani congrats!
@eilatg @kevinschawinski @acooray @KnudJahnke Definitely. My panel strongly felt it was a really good start though.
@kevinschawinski What is the point of this comment? It’s deeply unhelpful  especially as we don’t yet have proper stats.@knudjahnke @acooray
@acooray I think that’s something the HST TAC organizers would really really want flagged. Raise hell so it won’t happen again. @KnudJahnke
@eilatg @kevinschawinski @acooray @KnudJahnke PIs are allowed to reveal themselves - but panels shouldn’t guess (PI or gender).
@kevinschawinski @acooray @knudjahnke No  it didn’t backfire - it was generally really well received. That panel behaved badly. Most didn’t.
@eilatg They weren’t. And panelists were expressly told to NOT try to guess. @kevinschawinski @acooray @KnudJahnke
@kevinschawinski Umm yep I take my previous tweet back. At least in some small part.
@PenguinGalaxy *hug* I’m really sorry.
@orbitingfrog thank f*ck. @aagie @becky1505  PS miss you  sad I’m not there to say hi :)
@aagie @orbitingfrog in a jacket and tie?!?  Please tell me this is only for dinner in hall. Otherwise you will crush my non-corporate soul.
@NGC3314 “Kinda”? You okay? ;) @radiogalaxyzoo @owning_ivy
@aagie @dotastronomy looks like Tuesday is punting weather!
@dustchick @Meg_Urry @MartinHajovsky I realise I'm in a glass house here. We call galaxies luminous  ultra-luminous  hyper-luminous… #aas228
Came across these while decluttering my inbox between #aas228 sessions @startorialist https://t.co/5zPRbGp5LD https://t.co/h5FYfOzVx5
The community makes @galaxyzoo. Shoutout to the moderators &amp; collaborators  including @hannyvanarkel @PenguinGalaxy #aas228
@merrdiff sadly I already purchased some  like a chump. (Also the FRB talk is excellent.)
@merrdiff Now scheming to acquire a press badge.
@merrdiff Absolutely! ...there's coffee in the press room?
@merrdiff the Starbucks downstairs was deserted. Odd.
@ProfMike_M @chrislintott if that were a stronger effect with increasing redshift I suspect it would make theorists happy.
@chrislintott @merrdiff oh hang on  there is a mic  but it hasn't been used so far.
@aussiastronomer @PlanSciCRichey I’m still updating it! I figured this would be spammy on the hashtag so I’m doing it early :)
@kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters I believe it was also never really meant to shift much beyond z ~ 1 so an update would be excellent.
Morphological quenching of a 4-armed bulged spiral  via @NGC3314 https://t.co/HmnP0J3qb9
@nhuntwalker @niais @IBJIYONGI Except there was that one time when it was Lupus.
@NGC3314 I wonder if they think it’s also a deterrent? That’s the same advice as in the video. Active instruction to attack in self-defense.
@ProfMike_M It was. Luckily all digits still intact.
@kevinschawinski it’s okay. I don’t actually watch GoT… yet I know about many of the characters who die  and in what order. #thanksinterwebz
@kevinschawinski #missingspoilerwarning
@aallan @sarahkendrew Ugh  I haven’t started this yet. But I have started making new notes in my private research blog instead of EN.
@jen_gupta I suspect @chrislintott  just wants more excuses to visit Tucson.
@GeertHub @sarahkendrew @markmccaughrean San Diego was 16C and rainy this morning too. People were wearing winter coats  scarves  knit hats.
@CitSciAssoc Of course! It’s an important issue and the more member feedback  the better.
Also weigh in on whether the next @CitSciAssoc meeting should be in N. Carolina https://t.co/BEWdqYtBmH #transrights https://t.co/71NAePkDBC
@jen_gupta nice paper! :)
@GeertHub wow  that tweet is disturbing without context! :) congrats @exoplaneteer!!
@Blackprojects there are definitely blank images in there - we're working on removing them. Marking them is still useful though - thanks
@chrisenorth @boomerang I find it is. I've been using it for a year or so and it's great.
@kevinschawinski You’re trying to drink a pink-colored wine outside of Provence and expecting anything other than syrup?
@Enceladosaurus I believe Ron Buta gave a talk on this today at U. Alabama! @NGC3314 knows more :)
@raminskibba @kevinschawinski We’ll see what happens when they start releasing the details of the Americans named in the papers.
@kevinschawinski @raminskibba They threw eggs and yogurt at his window. As if to say “here’s breakfast  now GTFO you lying sleaze."
@reneehlozek I felt ashamed to be a @Princeton alum when I read this. “We’ll be super diverse from now on  honest!” is nowhere near enough.
@Enceladosaurus @PeterDEdmonds I found it useful to hold on to that possibility. You never know. Or  you may find another source of joy!
@reneehlozek :( Hope you got plenty of free flight coupons (and booze) for your trouble!
@jen_gupta Or we don’t tweet enough...
@shaka_lulu Glad you “ranted”. I didn’t know about @instacart before this &amp; now I wish such a thing existed that *wasn’t* exploitative.
@ProfMike_M @girlandkat @JointSpaceOps @SpaceTrackOrg I'm hoping without cause that today's reputation as a day of resurrection holds.
@kevinschawinski Uh  and then in the next breath that guy gives a voice to a misogynist troll by inviting him on to interview.
@NGC3314 I’m a night owl so I don’t mind staying up to observe :) but yes  summer outreach observing is always a challenge.
@chrisenorth @arfon At least  that’s the myth.
@chrisenorth @arfon Wasn’t it Linus Torvalds jokingly naming it after himself? https://t.co/42tyUJorQA
@kevinschawinski (going back to your question right after the #LIGO press conference)
@kevinschawinski our #LIGO speaker argued BH mergers &gt;&gt; NS mergers for a GW Nobel because NSs aren’t strong enough gravity for a pure test.
@kevinschawinski Strangely enough  not an option on the security question dropdown list. Nor cherry earl grey.
@kevinschawinski You’ve been ruined by a snarky pair of astronomers who keep adorable pet rats and give away the best artisanal stuff.
@kevinschawinski #icecreamtrolling
@astronomyblog I sort of wish they had. I can just imagine what the drop-down choices for answers would be (no free-form answers allowed).
@astronomyblog The reason “what’s your ideal first date?” wasn’t on the list is that I’d already chosen it for question #3.
@paulcoxon @iamscicomm Thank you! :)
@chrisenorth I’m not emoji-hip either! Was aiming for “ooh  burn… also you’re totally right &lt;should be sheepish but actually unapologetic&gt;"
@chrisenorth 🔥🔥💥😏
@chrisenorth INDEED. But at this point if I could manage a few hours clear of e-mail microdistractions I’d consider it progress.
@megschwamb Awesome! Congrats! @GeminiObs  is lucky to have you :)
@BenneHolwerda @dalcantonJD Maybe it’s El Cap only? Hmm.
@shaka_lulu @AaronKappel has some really good articles on @ESTBLSHMNT @HuffingtonPost and elsewhere. Good place to start maybe?
@kevinschawinski @astrobellatrix @eilatg Bit of a strange list though; e.g. @ezetre+2012’s point is to bring many of these studies together.
@kevinschawinski There was an AAS talk about this in January  I think. Very cool! @chandraxray @galaxyzoo
@kevinschawinski Bit like this  but with sharks? https://t.co/r1JmKC6zsW @the_zooniverse @kwwillett
@realscientists @KarenLMasters @gravinpetra Education &amp; Public Outreach
@realscientists @gravinpetra @KarenLMasters your assessment or your field’s? There’s some evidence those who blog do more science  not less.
@ehafen Really interesting chat. Talked with @kevinschawinski later about balancing agility with security+privacy infrastructure building.
@KarinaVoggel @kevinschawinski @claudiacicone @bennytr Buoyed by a tart that was less a baked good and more a delivery system for schnapps.
Apparently fondue isn’t authentic Zürich; nevertheless @kevinschawinski @claudiacicone @bennytr and I just ate all the cheese in the canton.
@shaka_lulu @dalcantonJD @jradavenport if seminar/talk Q&amp;A style is always “pokey” but rest of dept experience is nurturing  is that okay?
@mggtTaylor @sallyemmacooper @Dr_Lucie @jodcast It was so much fun! Science + sciComm + enough sleep to survive = #winning
Listen only because @mggtTaylor @sallyemmacooper @Dr_Lucie are brilliant  not for my sleep-deprived ramblings. https://t.co/AQTARylGux
@vrooje @SAOImageDS9 @Jeyhan @merrdiff Huh  weird  maybe it was that. Changed pref  from “Damaged  will not open” to “you sure?” And opened!
@merrdiff @Jeyhan @SAOImageDS9  from memory with my previous laptop  region files from one version of DS9 weren't compatible with another.
@SAOImageDS9 @Jeyhan @merrdiff It wasn’t that - option key gets around that already. It said the file was damaged.
@Jeyhan thank you! Had to go back to the Snow Leopard archive but it opened and loaded a file without crashing. :) @merrdiff @SAOImageDS9
@Jeyhan @merrdiff I remember doing that on my previous laptop! Do you have a version number that works?  Also ccing @SAOImageDS9
@merrdiff Alas  my new laptop came with it… but I have the X-win version it in a custom software folder. Took 3 mins to open  then hung. &gt;_&gt;
@jen_gupta @KarenLMasters @portsmouthuni  Yay  flyers!  I was sort of stunned we’d never had any before.
@PeterDEdmonds Mathematician  though as far as I can tell no current academic affiliation. Seems to have been really something 10 years ago.
@kevinschawinski Indeed  this does seem to be a grudge based on reading other tweets. Not the first time he’s been problematic.
@ProfMike_M Interesting. And nurses don’t feature in the UK poll. Thank you! (apologies for my google failure.)
@jen_gupta  a) awesome b) super awesome c) totally the awesomest
I’m particularly enjoying reading @realscientists this week! Mainly because #cheetahs + #science = #WIN. https://t.co/KoNK8VAeBw
An interactive version of periodic origins here: https://t.co/MGgIGQpXAd from @astronomyblog @chrisenorth  https://t.co/HEaNuElK8K
@jen_gupta Sometimes they’re telling me because they want to know how legit it is. I point out most objects have multiple names  so it’s ok.
@sarahkendrew @e_astronomer @Authorea? (I mostly use @GitHub.)
@chrisenorth @chrislintott Is there any reason they’d build it really asymmetrically so as to reproduce the observed light curve?
@chrisenorth We’ve also discussed how to put an upper limit on it based on assumptions that it’s intrinsically a normal (or bright?) F3.
@jegpeek @chrislintott @Astro_Wright and @tsboyajian
@chrisenorth @chrislintott ah wait  I see what you mean :)
@chrisenorth @chrislintott (so linear is probably reasonable on average over 1/14th the total build time)
@chrisenorth @chrislintott assuming occultation of flux in erg/s/cm^2 is really construction in m^2/time  right?
@chrisenorth @chrislintott if [Delta flux represented by 15% this century] is constant  why do we need to know where we are in the build?
@chrisenorth @chrislintott Does it require that starting date? Requires assumption of same rate overall.
@chrislintott @chrisenorth It’s like 1400 years  right? 700 for the side facing us…
Speaking of known harassers  why is @BlackPhysicists willing to be listed as a partner at https://t.co/Ys9v5xCEWA ? https://t.co/Mt9ZkFFk0b
@reneehlozek or “I take responsibility for learning how to never do harm again”. @orzelc @dalcantonJD
@UltraSteveG I’m guessing that’s a harmonic - have you flagged it in Talk? Thanks for classifying! @PulsarHunters @BBCStargazing
@astronomyblog *hugs*  It’s okay to feel like a mess.  Also I know external validation is not the point  but you are so  so valued.  *hugs*
@kevinschawinski the conference centre was fine. And it wasn't too hard to leave the hotel for more affordable food. Still soulless  though.
@astrobellatrix Yes  there was scatter - also it was a specifically selected sample so that may have helped things along...
@astrobellatrix It was one of those 5-minute talks and I missed how she calculated AGN Mdot  but it was SFR:Mdot ratio.
@kwwillett @ProfMike_M standard answer to title-as-question is "No". Provocative.
.@ProfMike_M cautions there's still work to do with dynamical models of bulges &amp; disks - this work is the start. A very good start. #aas227
Using just B/Tot ratios as a constraint  @ProfMike_M kinematically separates bulges and disks &amp; they seem "astrophysically plausible"#aas227
.@ProfMike_M is updating #aas227 on spectral decompositions of bulges and disks in @MaNGASurvey. SF in S0s is in bulges  not the disks.
@NGC3314 that must have been... Slow.
@davecl42 @ESAHerschel I missed the full data description while in tweet composition mode - definitely ask Lewis? This is a great talk.
@asymbina I love (and hate the truth in) this description. @see_the_sky @Enceladosaurus
@ProfMike_M Should be fun.
@chrisenorth I interpreted it as a sign of +1 excitement and fatigue. :) Congrats!

@CoopSciScoop @Astro_JohnCF @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters Note: FotW wasn’t rejected because of a "definition of citizen science” issue.
@CoopSciScoop @Astro_JohnCF @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters I suspect it will go ahead on the Zooniverse platform as an independent project.
@CoopSciScoop @Astro_JohnCF @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters Is this the Faces of the World project?
@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters Really? Hah!
@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters That’s a good point.
@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters The term just flags “the public is involved at some level above a BOINC”  but that’s all.
@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters I’m definitely not saying *don’t* use the term. But the actual content is in the details.
@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters It’s a bit like saying “the NSF should fund me because I’m a scientist doing science."
@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters I’m making the point that for practical justifications like that  it’s too broad.
@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters Sure. This sub-thread is a response to use of “citizen science” in proposals as justification.
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters We’re not actually disagreeing  you know.
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters There’s no single agreed definition  not even about core points  and that’s another problem.
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters My point is: you do have a definition &amp; not everything counts by it. And that’s okay.
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters I agree. But I saw posters at the CSA meeting in San Jose that wouldn’t.
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters New knowledge: my friend and I now know the pH of her pool. And maybe more about pH.
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters Okay. Does it count as research if there’s no intent to publish?
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters By some definitions  measuring my friend’s pool chemistry w/her counts as citizen science.
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters Either everything counts that claims to count  or you discriminate. When is it artificial?
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters Define “artificially”? If the alternative is dilution to the point of meaninglessness…
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters How do we reconcile all those definitions? Who decides what counts as citizen science?
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters Thing is  so many different things are called “citizen science” it’s not a useful shorthand.
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters I find it useful to separate practical reasons from fundamental reasons for using the term.
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters so… it *is* about separating citizen scientists from other scientists?
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters I’m not against the term citizen science/scientist. I just don’t think it’s The One Term.
@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters Great  so why suggest everyone should use a single term?
@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters We should ask them; for me  it’s problematic in how othering it is. Why not “collaborators”?
@kevinschawinski @karenlmasters @coopsciscoop “Minority”: should we go by person count or effort count? In the latter they’re the majority.
@kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters @CoopSciScoop Even though some of our most engaged volunteers a) blur boundaries  and b) hate the term?
@NGC3314 @KarenLMasters @CoopSciScoop I think highlighting it could come across as gimmicky/distracting. Doesn’t help convince skeptics.
@dalcantonJD @lukedones Dehumanization of citizens by police officers should be against police culture; instead it seems it’s encouraged.
@dalcantonJD @lukedones YES. Inexcusable. Over and over  lives shattered. Here  they did it when the paramedics were looking for her too?!
@dalcantonJD @lukedones And the part on the gofundme site about him cutting off their wifi “so they’ll want to move”.
@dalcantonJD @lukedones Obviously this isn’t the worst part of any story with a tragic death in it  but this person is despicable. Rage.
@GeertHub They’re only comfortable for the rare sub-species of leaning-people (pictured).

@c0nc0rdance Did you use the Jitterbug continuously? I want it to last as long as the experiment does  and it is a long experiment!
@c0nc0rdance the orbit for the current shaker I have is 3mm  the larger shaker has a 25mm orbit. shaking: 250rpm (former)  90 rpm (latter).
@c0nc0rdance Correct. App: Experimental evolution -- exploring the benchtop incubator options (alternative is a T controlled room).
@c0nc0rdance Been using VWR's but observing too much variability inside the "controlled volume" of the equipment.
@c0nc0rdance How about using a generic benchtop incubator shaker with microplate adapters? I wonder if that would be a sustainable option.
@JohnRSports Thank you  John!

@jessicaesquire @DrMRFrancis this is exactly why I'm forcing myself to watch the debate tonight: complacency prevention
@DrMRFrancis @jessicaesquire imagine 4 years tho.
@astronomeara https://t.co/3nRGxlET8Z
@brendonbrewer both simultaneously. if I feel I can't advocate at all  I won't agree to write
@carylgronwall great talk from Lea today btw
@BeckePhysics @BenLillie exactly!
@BenLillie @BeckePhysics Sure  &amp; I'm not disagreeing with that  but much of the misunderstanding of what science *is* is baked in in school
@astronomeara good times  now to finish up the galaxy catalog.....................
@MJIBrown @rcrain_astro @KarenLMasters (@kevinschawinski's "model" that inner CGM of red spirals should be dif from red Es had us excited)
@MJIBrown @rcrain_astro @KarenLMasters brighter than about 19mag in FUV (galex  AB). 19.5 is really pushing it. Very few QSOs this bright.
@MJIBrown @rcrain_astro @KarenLMasters @amelia_fmc @RossEHart yep. Bright enough to be obs'd w COS in reasonable time  &lt; 50 kpc proj
@MJIBrown @rcrain_astro @KarenLMasters @amelia_fmc @RossEHart not enough UV bright QSOs. We looked.
@MJIBrown @rcrain_astro oh hey I know that plot
@Quasilocal @astronomeara @lumenphosphor yeah.....no.
@aussiastronomer yay Elodie!!
@Quasilocal @astronomeara @lumenphosphor please tell me that's a typo
@MJIBrown 😒
@rachelosten software is necessary but not sufficient
@BenneHolwerda @PenguinGalaxy it's hard to find...i got my copy at a used bookstore in Wellington. ST's library didn't even have a copy
@PenguinGalaxy @BenneHolwerda biography of Beatrice Hill Tinsley https://t.co/b4ucjlGKHo
@gstalnaker No. See https://t.co/b4ucjlGKHo
@DrMRFrancis lolsob
@jegpeek your kitchen table is closer
@kejames sigh.
@sondy yowch
@iva_momcheva @eteq @LouisStrolger @demitrimuna great minds https://t.co/XNtwBS9CpR
@demitrimuna @astrogrant @eteq I admit to being mildly amused at your recent postings Demitri  given that this was in the works
@Harcel @njgoldbaum @eteq @stsci exactly that :)
@brettmor @eteq what  emoji on Twitter isn't enough detail for you? 😎
@njgoldbaum @eteq nope  internal @stsci funds of awesome
@eteq @LouisStrolger sooooooo can we tell everyone yet how you're solving Pythonastronomy etc
@JohnDebes and probably some of this week's deadlines.........
@JohnDebes @sarahkendrew 1.7" in Fed Hill before 7am.
@npr247 @kevinschawinski good to see you were paying attention :)
@DrMRFrancis (november?)
@DrMRFrancis yaaaasssssss
@astronomeara your being on an airplane today came up in a skype convo  this morning  you'll be shocked to discover
@SCTrager @michael_w_busch @astrotweeps note the red Line under the 0.3 :)
@DrRubidium up 3% in the last  4 years
@astrotweeps which maybe they should advertise more.....  (My 1st encounter w NSF was as a panelist and I had no idea what was going on)
@astrotweeps oooooh it's super obvious from this end!: "stay on the PO's good side"
@astronomeara 🌮
@astronomeara 🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮
@kevinschawinski starting??
@astrotweeps @DrMRFrancis so points to your student for having calendar pop ups!
@gravitate_to_me more surprised than anything else...hadn't thought I could become one of "those" people. Still not really I guess.
@BenneHolwerda three guesses of my current location :)
@jegpeek only reason not an A+ is because of lack of oxford comma tbh
@jegpeek @BenneHolwerda @conselice cc @gfsnyder
@erinleeryan @JohnDebes just checked and apparently me too  don't know for how long it's been though
@realscientists ....the early scientist gets the bird?
@Summer_Ash I hear you're responsible for this? ❤️❤️🌈🌈 cc @jegpeek https://t.co/93WXwUtr5G
@astrotweeps I'd be flabbergasted if anyone following astrotweeps is not also following @AstroKatie!
@DrRubidium s/grading and grant writing/review article writing/ and yeah.
@ProfMike_M @deborahblum It's also...as a resident of Baltimore....I find sensationalism of these kinds of headlines to be almost dangerous
@realscientists NOT A BIRD
If you like birds or at least pictures of birds check out @realscientists now https://t.co/Sgy3FWXCew
@njgoldbaum 300 to 550.
@BenneHolwerda @SCTrager @drannawatts the grocery store as in life
@josh_sokol it's like you and @jegpeek are the same person
@jegpeek https://t.co/6x2LYsctyN
@jegpeek what I don't get: WHY CAN'T THEY JUST READ THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE
@jegpeek but here's the thing: if the SCHOOLS can't afford A/C  heat....what makes them think kids will be better AT HOME?
@astrotweeps @dalcantonJD our group uses the Paper app a lot. Just finger or stylus tho
@astro_jje @JohnDebes even worse: a BALTIMORE accent =-o
@astro_jje @JohnDebes do it do it do it
@jegpeek @AnnFinkbeiner same webcast link
@astrokatey a rocket to launch it into space
@JohnDebes @astro_jje bonus: baltimore's housing marking is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy less whack than auckland's
@telescoper @sarahkendrew @jegpeek so not dull. the fun doesn't stop for those pesky summer months!
@astrotweeps @biotweeps totally using #fighttheavocado as a #worklifebalance hashtag now
@PlanetDr I'm really glad I decided the laundry could wait 15 minutes
@jegpeek @aprilfollies "actually"
@astraughnomer @astronomeara @Summer_Ash @shannonmstirone OK  now highly amused--- I hadn't seen these tweets when I linked earlier today!
@AstroKatie @mcnees what i &lt;3 re this story is all day my feed has been full of "no we did not find aliens" which out of context = awesome
@hubbahubble https://t.co/IwEtO0oxel
@DrRubidium A+
@SCTrager @Harcel @BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 but the "e" in "ear" and "best" are different
@SCTrager @Harcel @BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 "ear......p"
@Harcel @BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 I can't even make that sound in my head
@BenneHolwerda it's less than a year old. iphone 6s.
@aussiastronomer @dalcantonJD @AnnFinkbeiner maybe i shoudl have let it go through the spin cycle
@aussiastronomer @dalcantonJD @AnnFinkbeiner but mine was a good 20m in the rinse cycle
@aussiastronomer @dalcantonJD @AnnFinkbeiner ( i remember something like this when researching when my dad's phone drowned)
@aussiastronomer @dalcantonJD @AnnFinkbeiner my theory is it doesn't help compared to say  just leaving it be.
@planettvguide @arielwaldman i now suddently care about prox b!
@TCNoel @SciTriGrrl @DrNeilTyson yeah. when i first saw someone tweet it this morning i was super pleasantly surprised &amp; then was like  oh.
@TCNoel @SciTriGrrl @DrNeilTyson too bad it's not  actually  you know  NdGT
@astronomeara so btw: favorite papers talking about elemental abundances ratios in cgm/igm? email me?
@astronomeara (funny part being that with July = Phase II month  conferences for me in summer actually kind of hard)
@astronomeara teaching  schmeaching
@astronomeara I like this idea
@astronomeara YES! if we worked together this would give me extra motivation for getting Spectator to work with it  too!

@astronomeara ☁️☁️☁️💨☁️
@KarenLMasters @EverydaySexism @jen_gupta yep. Irritating af
@jegpeek @astronomeara so NOW we know who you should have emailed this morning 😉
@astronomeara @jegpeek @sarahkendrew @eteq #dtu17 looks like?
@astronomeara @jegpeek do we have a hashtag? Cc @sarahkendrew @eteq
@sondy yep
@josh_sokol @Hubble_Live my fave is NONE
@josh_sokol @Hubble_Live yeah  it's hilarious to see who *actually* dominates HST time!
@e_astronomer @tsdower @astrocrawford @SALT_Astro @Hubble_Live just read abstract and yeah! fascinating!
@JohnDebes @DaveKary @NGC3314 #omnomnom
@aussiastronomer @natalie_hinkel A+ gif deployment there
@brianwolven @erinleeryan @ngc3314 @Summer_Ash @RachelFeltman @mirikramer basically we won't believe it til there's a cake picture tweet
@bjmclaughlin @stsci https://t.co/H6M6Y47cPW is also pretty great; scroll to the bottom!
@NGC3314 hey @erinleeryan you seen any cakes recently
@NGC3314 gonna laugh so hard if it discovers it doesn't exist
@bjmclaughlin I *think* it uses the same info as populates https://t.co/hINe1cqaGw but I'm not 100% sure
@bjmclaughlin (the account just went live about 36? hours ago  which is why you haven't heard about it before...)
@bjmclaughlin straight from the source! @STScI schedules @HubbleTelescope observations  so that schedule is scraped and livetweeted!
Telecon time. @astronomeara currently in the lead for "best Skype status". https://t.co/3m6XZI2Ue5
@Jos_de_Bruijne @BenneHolwerda  but @ESAGaia could do the "here's a ground-based snapshot of the field" thing.....
@arielwaldman @planettvguide yeah :) I keep waiting for something I actually know to start airing somewhere....
@arielwaldman similar but different  have you seen @planettvguide?
@BenneHolwerda @erinleeryan @SCTrager lolololololol
Hey @jegpeek have you seen the list of examples in the what's allowed for ARAA figure enhancements? https://t.co/Vap2BWu6aE #CGMreview
@mcnees given that it had 2 followers before I started following &amp; advertising it....I now take all the credit for its followership :)
@BenneHolwerda @SCTrager let's discuss how walking outside and thinking you just walked into a wall feels.
@SCTrager @BenneHolwerda define "brutal"
@BenneHolwerda here  this week is finally nice and cool after ridonkeylously hot last week
@BenneHolwerda aaahhhh
The little divots that deviate from smooth spectrum are bc trace amts of heavy elements in the "atmosphere". Ask @JohnDebes for more info :)
@BenneHolwerda ?
@BenneHolwerda :(
@BioInFocus @sondy ironically  if the target audience was already on twitter...
@MJIBrown *looks at clock and checks arxiv*
@MJIBrown *sits patiently*
@xuhulk @roseveleth @antichrista cc @sondy
@kevinschawinski @hubble_live @hubbletelescope @ngc3314 yes. a summer intern set it up  more details to come.
@BenneHolwerda show off
@JohnDebes whereby "awesome" you mean "terrifying"
@JohnDebes or vomiting  given the subject matter
@JohnDebes @HistoryInPics @deltacarina would not put up with that shit  Being in a car fucks w/ their equilibrium enough  zero-g just cruel
Yaaaay!!! @astro_jje is hosting @astrotweeps this week! From New Zealand  where it's already the FUTURE 😳 https://t.co/8fOjQ5DdyH
@johannateske @aussiastronomer &lt; tries to resist urge to say something about how women don't get Nobel prizes in physics sooo... but fails &gt;
@hubbahubble WOW
@jbprime help me out here https://t.co/1ZKe03eaBQ
@scifri and @planettvguide
@scifri @AndromedaBot
@gsnarayan @merrdiff YAY FLOWCHARTS
@RealRohitArora @realscientists @JeffreyYWMak https://t.co/W0BwDoREwr https://t.co/VsjU2EODnx https://t.co/yP87dFqdMm arxiv:1306.3261
@mcnees id been thinking the exact same parallel but when I saw everyone else had tweeted it I resisted
@njgoldbaum this is caused something else  but having a huge writing assignment requiring critical thought sure isn't helping
@DrRubidium not even good hair. What kind of prof. swimmer idiot do you have to be to dye your hair?! There's like ONE rule of dying hair
@jbprime (M82??)
@jbprime skeptical
@astronomeara sweet italian or chicken apple?
@astronomeara see thread https://t.co/XSdhmazhbr
@erinleeryan @JohnDebes give me SOME credit...I have plenty of hard cider  Scotch  and mezcal in here to see me through
@DrMRFrancis so it's good to see non-louisiana people bringing attention
@DrMRFrancis I have a friend (who posts on fb a lot  too) who's running one of the shelters in Baton Rouge. + brother's brother lives in BR
@DrMRFrancis i'm really glad this is actually getting coverage. South Carolina is still recovering from floods 11mo ago  but no one cared
@NGC3314 @janerrigby ...what's sad is i know the song well enough it's now playing in my head.
@astraughnomer I understood....some of that.
@jegpeek @cloud149 please please please
.@startorialist  with the #Olympics2016 coverage we need. https://t.co/KtkNciI3Ag
Hey  @startorialist  let's discuss @DanellJLeyva's "lucky towel": where do I get one??? https://t.co/Sc7wEJINX9 https://t.co/RXkrPNPiOX
@cosmicpinot @AstroKatie @Astro_yyz I'll settle for tenure tbh
@MJIBrown I was really grooving it until I saw wavenumber. yick.
@jeff_foust @PlanetDr here: https://t.co/kfZTChHcaX
@jeff_foust @PlanetDr I can confirm it's awful out there
@McMillan_Astro @astrotweeps @LMHowes maybe we are talking about different stars
@jegpeek @dstndstn @astrotweeps given that oxygen is the most abundant metal?
@astrotweeps yep. my point is just that iron isn't the only metal :)
@astrotweeps except that  by MASS of metals  the CEMP stars are actually not extremely metal-poor. Just IRON-poor.
@jbprime @MBKplus @bigticketdw @cooperUCI JAMES don't you know that if the title is a question the answer is NO ?!
@sondy cc @MAST_News
@jegpeek @SaraOgaz42 amen amen amen
@DrMRFrancis yep
@EthonRaptor @corbett gonna guess an igloo at the South Pole doesn't need a fridge
@hubbahubble @justincely @willowdower but RIAs are broad: some straight out of college  some have had multiple postdocs
@hubbahubble @justincely @willowdower yes  i believe so? Justin can speak to software branch jobs better than I can.
@hubbahubble @justincely @willowdower ST is chock full of "alternate" career paths :)
@hubbahubble i haven't a clue! but if she's willing to relocate....
@hubbahubble also see @STScI past tweets for screenshots of past postings
@hubbahubble @justincely @willowdower keep an eye on the job listing site (&amp; follow @STScI). new postings all the time!
@hubbahubble common for RIAs to go to grad school in astro. e.g.  @m_j_durbin is starting at UW this fall after working on (iirc) WFC3 team
@hubbahubble RIA = research instrument analyst. https://t.co/segmdqZKpV many hires all the time  not current an ad out  but likely soon
@hubbahubble RIA is most obvious. also exist lots of software jobs  e.g.  https://t.co/09uh4H5OoE (cc @justincely  @willowdower)
@hubbahubble ---can use CS skills  possibly get into research  see if astro grad school is for her  or other route 2/2
@hubbahubble depends on what kind of job she's interested in! though sounds perfect for one of many @STScI jobs--- 1/2
@mcnees looks kind of like a planetary microlensing lightcurve
@DrRubidium Again.
@kevinschawinski TV not there yet  just to exoplanets. Cc @planettvguide
@jegpeek @jason__rhodes rename after launch?
@astrotweeps sub-grid models all the way down
@PlanetDr  was there a solution or do i just go make dinner and hope @NBCOlympics can get their shit together?
@PlanetDr @NBCOlympics best part is it looks like it does when there IS video but it can be fast-forwarded. but no  no no.
@PlanetDr @NBCOlympics it's beyond awful. and I WOULDN'T HAVE TO WATCH IT IF THE SITE STAYED ON THE WEB ADDRESS I'M AT
.@PlanetDr @NBCOlympics BUT NO! I cant even get the goddamn EXISTING VIDEO to JUST PLAY without redirecting to the GODAWFUL "daily dismount"
@PlanetDr @NBCOlympics I literally closed all my devices and had it streaming. Opening Japanese floor routine  planned for 3 hrs of awesome.
@marshallperrin @jegpeek @pkgw @JohnDebes @Iguananaut scientists who muck up code ...
@willowdower @jegpeek @JohnDebes @pkgw @Iguananaut @marshallperrin INS lacks software developers per se-- lots done  but not as a job title
@jegpeek @pkgw cc @justincely
@aussiastronomer eek!
@astrotweeps or all that mattered was once they formed their first stars!
@astrotweeps I loathe the phrase "galaxy formation". as if galaxies ever stop forming!!
@mirikramer space can wait. just ask @powellstacie
@NGC3314 +1 for book placement
This week on @astrotweeps is @AndreeaFont  who's talking about playing w/ fake galaxies to learn about real ones :-) https://t.co/AWft8c1uk4
@BenneHolwerda gods I'm glad she's ok
@DrRubidium @lisamjarvis hickeys but without the fun part
@te_pickering @brianwolven Christ
@DrMRFrancis @fivefifths many
@kejames we just barely missed it  caught the end. I sure as hell hope she's ok
@WoodLloydWood @MoonriseFest yep  this was in the evening and it was shining. Bonus real moon in background :)
@brianwolven though tbh if cleaning up everyone else's mess  @MrTrashWheel is probably a Ms :/
@brianwolven @jsnell @MrTrashWheel yaaaaassss
@brianwolven @jsnell I made sure to refer to Baltimore's 🚈 earlier today
@jdlafontaine hey  @eteq  next time you name a new dwarf galaxy  you should totally name it Pygmy
@PlanetDr yikes  i didn't realize that! how **awful**
@jr_pritchard pretty sure that was back in April ;)
@astronomeara I bet there's not even any meowing
@astronomeara still
@astronomeara even though he only has 14 more followers than my cat?!
@mcnees huh
@mcnees doesn't look accurate--- https://t.co/iVtksOh3lu *definitely* has many dozens of "self-citations"
@kennicosmith ugh. 6am flights awful. Hope mom is ok
@brianwolven heh
@brianwolven wah?
@mcnees "Christ  what an asshole."
@mcnees @Gap @PsychScientists einstien  lol
@njgoldbaum @yt_astro bad habit
@njgoldbaum @yt_astro don't know why I was messing with install script
@njgoldbaum @yt_astro ooooh yeah that's what I did last time. I guess I didn't properly replicate :) thanks
@njgoldbaum @yt_astro need dev with source for trident
@njgoldbaum @yt_astro basically  did exactly what had worked so well for osx  but on linux
@njgoldbaum @yt_astro not really sure how to use either and am about to leave for the day :-) I did have inst_conda = 0 bc astroconda
@njgoldbaum @yt_astro  interestingly *not* needed on any of the osx installations: https://t.co/jQAEpWsuT4
@mcnees you're depressing
@JohnDebes @merrdiff hey john what's the WBS for "I need to read Harry Potter RIGHT NOW"?
@merrdiff 2007....I remember picking up DH at midnight at a local B&amp;N and baaasically not putting it down til 4pm. good times.
@merrdiff I was having it delivered to work  so therefore could not fall for the "we'll deliver it at midnight!!" ruse
@kejames thanks :) one of my favorites  even if I got the date wrong-- August 2005  shortly before starting grad school! strong memories...
@astronomeara @united ughgghhhghhh
@astronomeara @united wow. That's what? 5  6 hours?
@michael_w_busch @astrotweeps have you read both? I thought the 3rd wasn't out in English yet  but has same translator as first.
@BenneHolwerda @astrotweeps I second station 11
@astrotweeps Three Body Problem Ancillary Sword trilogy
@realscientists cross-pollination of different education research programs. eg: do physics ed  math ed  chem ed etc. learn from each other?
@realscientists muggy Baltimore morning here. Just got back from the grocery store  now time to read a student's paper!
@realscientists good morning!
@JohnDebes yay having a hashtag
@kejames sure  but also  balloons!
@mcnees asshat troll
@AcademicsSay @realscientists @MissSinBin 100% accurate
@PlanetDr ja  pretend :)
@PlanetDr "Prof. Hickenlooper" / "Dr. Hickenlooper" TOTALLY going to be my made up scientist names now because TOTALLY MADE UP NAME
@PlanetDr OMG HICKENLOOPER IS A REAL NAME THANK YOU SARAH this is information i needed this makes me smile
@PlanetDr @sarahkendrew flash floods on 83S but dry on way to parking garage
@PlanetDr @brianwolven i was astounded to see the rain gauge
@PlanetDr @brianwolven south baltimore. i tried leaving before the storm hit and drove through the beginning bad of it.
@brianwolven @PlanetDr nearly done here. Over two inches!
@sarahkendrew @jegpeek I remember visiting Baltimore in July after 3 years on LA &amp; being surprised at the thunder
@kashanacauley @mirikramer we will always have ice cream and cash Biden with us in our hearts
@kejames @hourlykitten @edbites it's not hourly  and she's not really a kitten anymore...but @deltacarina is always sourced to herself
@sondy does remind one why MD is not a in-the-bag "blue" state
@sondy was wondering if you'd get to see this!!!
@brettmor @nhuntwalker @sharelatex wait  tagging ppl in a tweet isn't the same as an email? :-D
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @sharelatex got it! I had a [draft] after the \documentclass b/c overleaf was timing out--- removed it &amp; good to go!
@nhuntwalker @brettmor @sharelatex and it's same if figure is eps  png  jpg  pdf.... and also the same in the render and in the dl'd pdf
@brettmor @nhuntwalker @sharelatex this...an EXCLUSIVE SNEAK PEEK of our figures.... https://t.co/16VG06vsLa
@BenneHolwerda this one was a review of an article on Tinsley  based on both of her biographies. Which I have. Sitting on my shelf unread :(
@BenneHolwerda @emsque of course!! cartoons  even :-)
@orzelc ok  @mcnees is my favorite new verb
@NGC3314 Christ
@JohnDebes  1) "as one does" 2) metaphor for a calibration meeting?
@mcnees mission accomplished
@nhuntwalker I've friends who changed their names based on script to ensure new names could be spelled w/ periodic table symbols (perl  tho)
@njgoldbaum i cannot understate the amount of frustration i've had with this in the past. this time  so smooth  i keep poking it  confused.
@nhuntwalker @iDIKher Python script
@nhuntwalker @iDIKher depends on the kid  yeah? some B+ is huuuuge effort  others  laziness
@nhuntwalker @iDIKher after-school programs FTW. Great for both "good" and "bad" kids.
@JohnDebes #sadface
@mcnees holy shit
@PlanetDr sounds quite memorable
@mirikramer I did! I did! I thought it captured the relevant nuances.
@drannawatts @jr_pritchard AND cost / benefit is low: "counts" less than time spent writing papers
@PlanetDr my parents' dog. his name is Huey  because "he hovers. like a helicopter."
@DrRubidium bonus: inside and air-conditioned?
@realscientists @cbrnewzealand yay @AucklandUni!
@realscientists @BLHSMendis @RealSciMods hello!
@PeterDEdmonds we could have a whole series! "10 ways to not be an asshole when co-authoring a paper" "10 ways to not be an asshole when..."
@mcnees ❤️
@jegpeek @BenneHolwerda bonus twitter autocomplete suggestion: https://t.co/Kif2Dji16B
@jegpeek @BenneHolwerda does a keynote file named "figure pile" count as a "master design doc"? #askingforfriend
@erinleeryan @sondy does this mean all-male photos of scientists are also sexist? Please say yes
@DrMRFrancis that's how us chromies feel using firefox
@jegpeek @DavidJHelfand "Think everything you believe."
@JohnDebes and eat donuts
@astrotweeps more pictures please!!!
@startorialist color me impressed!
@BoingBoing cc @startorialist
@DrMRFrancis amen
@jegpeek i'm so flabbergasted twitter actually DID something
@jegpeek he got banned?! that's AWESOME!!
@artologica @nccomfort I lol'd.
@jbprime @eteq yep. parallel deep fields will be all the rage!
@sondy ...I just realized @ObservatoryCats follows @deltacarina but not me. I'm kind of proud.
@eteq @btucker22 unproductive
@JohnDebes @rosemcgowan (same image was @stsci's header image until the recent Crab image was released...)
Hey @JohnDebes check out @rosemcgowan's header image :-) STIS has made it big-time!! #STISfunfact https://t.co/O9x6QQlOZB
@josh_sokol done anything on @SuperASASSN?
@josh_sokol no  seriously  i'm not sure i remembered it was a binary ;)
@josh_sokol OJ 287!! I know very little about this given I'm a coauthor on a not well-cited 2010 about it
@mirikramer deleted!
@astrotweeps but if I go do I get an Antartica passport stamp ?
OH HEY @corbett is hosting @astrotweeps this week!! FROM THE SOUTH POLE!! ⛄️🔭🐧 https://t.co/OUJdccuvFL
@hubbahubble @jr_pritchard even *better* situated for negotiation in the future
@jr_pritchard @hubbahubble like  it super-sucks at the time  but being extra-established as a starting faculty *really* helps 1st few years
@jr_pritchard @hubbahubble though  tbh  folks who go through rigamarole more than once are better suited to negotiate  start new groups  etc
@jr_pritchard @hubbahubble?
@DrMRFrancis it'd be so entertaining if that wasn't the case :(
@hubbahubble currently (finally) reading the wired article  saw thing re tmrw's panel. that's awesome! i hope it goes well / is fulfilling!
@DrRubidium brill
@OmanReagan @mirikramer NASA is seen by some as a vehicle for science  by some as a way to develop technologies useful for military defense?
@mirikramer I guess it's: how much of a "speech" is the words vs the action  the event?
@mirikramer isn't even being present political though?
@DrRubidium I want to like this once for the message and again for your gif game

@astrotweeps nm  did maths  ok. carry on.
@astrotweeps ?? I'd go with 1.
@BenneHolwerda new one will fit king size comforter though :):)
@BenneHolwerda I can usually get a load in per week....
@mcnees and see how easy it is to give credit
@DrMRFrancis yaaaaas
@NGC3314 @BenneHolwerda 3rd book comes out in English in September
@jchowk @cfroning @BenneHolwerda O.O
@cfroning @BenneHolwerda I also rec Station Eleven. Beautiful.
@BenneHolwerda ah :)  have you read the ancillary justice trilogy?
@BenneHolwerda already finish it? :)
@mcnees @deray fucking A
@mcnees now imagine if you were also female
@SCTrager @El_Lobo_Rayado @BenneHolwerda "but are the senior people who don't do Twitter really worth connecting with?"
@mcnees lol
@El_Lobo_Rayado @SCTrager @BenneHolwerda dooooo iiiiiittt
@SCTrager @BenneHolwerda BONUS: easy way to get student's name to other people in community  "meet" other people w/out $$
@SCTrager @BenneHolwerda 1000%. I just found a paper that was basically written in response to one of mine &amp; no one ever emailed it to me :(
@DrRubidium 😂
Now David Rosario continues on what we can learn about mid-IR AGN with @NASAWebb #jwstroe https://t.co/BMKlxhU2df
Summary of Rieke's talk: [Ne VI] and how what's been learned from @NASAspitzer will be useful for @NASAWebb #jwstroe https://t.co/cp0eV0K1LZ
@jegpeek relevant to our interests: https://t.co/37dYLOVQSv #dtu
@aussiastronomer 😂😴
@mcnees surprising part being that it's been filed  not that it happened
@biphenyl @dalcantonJD oh  yes! i thought was response to the spatial resolution comparison. one issue is no GO on Euclid  yes?
@NGC3314 @sarahkendrew @NatureNews that's 4 words :P
What's your #threewordthesis? @NatureNews is collecting them :) https://t.co/pJmWkaiKy0
@Harcel @massimastro @BenneHolwerda @astrosteven @npr247 yay for being able to see stuff!
@Harcel @BenneHolwerda @astrosteven take @npr247's bet :)
@Harcel @BenneHolwerda @astrosteven @npr247 nothing is crazy expensive right now with the current GBP
@massimastro @BenneHolwerda @astrosteven ("sheer luck" is astronomer speak for "cosmic variance")
@BenneHolwerda @astrosteven all I know is @npr247 is betting a bottle of Ardbeg #JWST will find a z=20 galaxy in the first year. #jwstroe
@NGC3314 to be sure. which is why easy readability = major benefit! (@massimastro is "early-career"?)
#HotSci @STScI today: @eteq on dwarf gals &amp; Barrera-Ballesteros on @MaNGASurvey. 3:30pm EDT https://t.co/dP4m8h5QTq https://t.co/y6VWd15iet
@hubbahubble samesame
@ProfMike_M i meant to time how long it'd take to get a response like that.  i dislike drinking ashtrays.
@BenneHolwerda not that i know of. my understanding is "key" drives design; clearly not the case here
@ProfMike_M (final disclaimer: even though I'm at ST  i actually have nothing to do with running our TAC. just hear lots about it.)
@ProfMike_M now this is a bigger issue to address than just how to allocate telescope time!
@ProfMike_M and i'm unconvinced any change in organization structure can truly address that.
@ProfMike_M what i'm saying is when science case is good but data being requested can't actually achieve it. wool over eyes of non-experts
@ProfMike_M yeah  that too :)
@ProfMike_M oh sure. but "doable" isn't clear cut. observe SgrA* from Scotland? not doable. answer science Q with certain data? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@ProfMike_M currently  can't observe ANYTHING from scotland! ☁️☁️☁️
@ProfMike_M i find they are fairly intertwined
@ProfMike_M ... when *no* experts can weigh in
@ProfMike_M I'm *not* saying decisions should be made *solely* by experts; am saying issues can arise (akin to your random num generator)...
@ProfMike_M ... basically always choose smaller program  especially if no expert in the room who can actually speak to differences
@ProfMike_M another trap: 2 proposals both claim to do same science  one asks for half the time. non-expert panel psychology will ...
@ProfMike_M in theory  I agree. but in practice  means time can go to team w/ best salesmanship  not actually the best science. annoying.
@BenneHolwerda early release science and otherwise. GTOs basically know what they want (hence why they built the instruments!)
@old_pyjamas @ProfMike_M uh  that's 100% irrelevant.
@ProfMike_M in a science utopia  perhaps that would work
@ProfMike_M seems to also run issue of people who are conflicted cannot review  leaving proposals subject to review by non-experts
@ProfMike_M do you have a better method than what is currently done?
Definite theme so far is "we've learned so much from @NASAspitzer! imagine how zomg @NASAWebb will be!!" (paraphrased) #jwstroe
@erinleeryan cc @startorialist
@BenneHolwerda #woopwoop
@kejames i'm in scotland and am yet to see or hear a bagpipe
@PlanetDr bummed all the action will be in the middle of the night here
@hubbahubble number 1 reasons to have conferences  tbh
@PlanetDr @sarahkendrew to be fair  i went for a run here yesterday and it was lovely  in part because it wasn't sweltering hot
@aussiastronomer oooh cake
@PlanetDr @sarahkendrew 🙉
@newscientist @DrRubidium yeah  it it is a well done costuming / lighting / etc
@newscientist @DrRubidium and that's not even a picture of her :(
@kejames so  you know  actual stuffs
@astrotweeps hallo!
@astrodave2 nothing is infinite :)
@aussiastronomer mmm....nap.....
probably the biggest recent new #JWST news is that @NASAWebbTelescp is now @NASAWebb :-) #jwstroe
@astrokiwi @AAOastro strange and annoying
@cosmicpinot @AAOastro before the brexit vote I was like "oh my god how have they not voted yet" and then I was like "oh"
@corbett @aussiastronomer tylenol pm (depending on length of flight)  also: good eye mask + noise canceling headphones
uh  Australia  @AAOastro  this is kind of weird. https://t.co/a1FdLE0Wcv
@albertoconti I don't see NEARLY enough old bay there
@DrRubidium ooooooh
@astrotweeps took me quiiiite a while to figure out that authors were mis-referencing each other!
@astrotweeps 👋
@astrotweeps poor 16sw :'(
@astrotweeps and also terribly misnamed in much of the literature! See footnote in https://t.co/lHAgUuyPX6
@mcnees ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️ #ImissLA
@mcnees a what now
@mcnees no. https://t.co/gBCazvXp5Z
@mcnees I'm not looking forward to adjusting my circadian rhythms in Edinburgh Sunday :(
@NASAWebb YAY shorter handle!!
@mcnees i wouldn't say i'm a "fan" of clinton  but....this does make my heart go pitter-patter a little
@DrRubidium ~gulp~  (I'm suitably impressed!)
@DrRubidium is your barre class really as early in the morning as it seems like it is?
@lynn_carter8 @sondy yep
@mcnees gonna miss them
@kennicosmith it is in fact pretty sweet
(as team lead &amp; moving-target guru  @JohnDebes can tell you how much of a #STISfunfact-filled time it was getting observations to happen...)
@astrotweeps tweet?
@jbprime that's galaxy-speak for "drunk"  @astronomeara
@jbprime wtf is up with gizmo
@DrRubidium haven't looked at list but....all white heroes?
@sondy be safe
@ProfMike_M unclear  actually. Visa is through Swedish spouse's right to be there...  Meanwhile 10% of their savings disappeared overnight
@JohnDebes idk  maybe slam on the breaks?  and it's not like a human  let alone a driverless car  can tell the diff btwn "Doctor" &amp; "robber"
@JohnDebes I couldn't complete it. Only factor in some is gender of victim?!
@alicebell @jr_pritchard wow
@aomawa @hubbahubble filed under "work w/ people who you want to work w/"; collaboration not just about shared interests but comfort  safety
@JohnDebes @Astro_Wright @astroprofhoff what about it?
@JohnDebes @Astro_Wright @astroprofhoff candidate also likely to not know who is on "the committee"  who is influential  etc
@mcnees yeah  just found &amp; read that. seems...bizarre
@mcnees https://t.co/ijDEvP4KvO
@mcnees ~blink~  *googles*
@mcnees @niais that was FOUR DAYS AGO you can't expect it to be relevant NOW?!
@mcnees I wonder when the last time the cameras were turned off was
@BenneHolwerda @iva_momcheva https://t.co/fUpaLtlB9H
@BenneHolwerda @iva_momcheva now I don't have to RT it for this year
@mcnees hostage is when a bill with 53 yays  47 nays = failed. because MATH.
@StartsWithABang @AdamFrank4 @nytimes "may"
@PlanetDr thinking of you today
@PlanetDr Monday the pilot began an announcement with  "At the risk of starting a mutiny...."
@aussiastronomer @TroyBernier cc @TrueSciPhi
@PlanetDr https://t.co/RNBK8KxHqw
@PlanetDr oh jeez  that's particularly inconsiderate
@PlanetDr oh gods that's maddening
@PlanetDr ugh. i hope you can make your connection and get where you're going. superannoying.
@PlanetDr @Delta YAY!
@hubbahubble ptango!
@mcnees surely that's more than covered. Donate: https://t.co/s6vilKyqn7
@willowdower @jegpeek @ashleenwilkins and by if one or both senators have spoken yet &amp; by party
@jegpeek @willowdower I was able to get to Mikulski's box but not Cardin's
@mcnees tried but @SenatorCardin's voicemail is full!! #holdthefloor
@SenatorBarb @SenatorCardin thank you for speaking up today
@kejames @PlanetDr the jumping!!!! i don't know if i've ever been so excited about something as he is about that
@PlanetDr @kejames not a bunny  but the jumping!! https://t.co/pAyPszb83I
@kejames really sorry that happened to you
@kejames WHAT
@BadPhysics kitty toys?
@kevinschawinski *i* do! as with most things  problem isn't me  it's everyone else :-P
@kevinschawinski @nobelprize doesn't mean it's not a problem. morally wrong to ascribe this success to only three people.
@kevinschawinski @nobelprize except for the fucking ridiculous "only three individuals" nonsense
@mcnees saw that earlier (before deleted) with a big dose of what the actual fuck
@artologica @Alex_Parker @brianwolven @ZachWeiner TI-89. Natch
@merrdiff @NASAWebbTelescp #sigh
@DrMRFrancis @maggiekb1 @pourmecoffee it was clear :)
@DrMRFrancis @maggiekb1 @pourmecoffee policing language is just another way gents like to control women
@mirikramer sweet!
@DrRubidium ugh
@PlanetDr @jemillerwbal whoa
@scorfano @BenneHolwerda then we're all outta ideas
@JohnDebes am camped out with laptop in @CafeAzafran. not ideal  but doable.
@astrotweeps I just got a great idea for the February 2018 TIPS 🍾
@josh_sokol not for H0. DE yes
@josh_sokol will ask. Help which part exactly ?
@erinleeryan @astrotweeps @MarkDavidLacy STIS has about a zillion modes  like zomg. #STISfunfact #quantifiablytrue
@BenneHolwerda @astronomeara and here I was like  "10? le sigh"
@jchowk @sondy also: passive language. And "that"
@jchowk @sondy check for inverted language. Eg "rate of formation" --&gt; "formation rate"
Not my style but cc @startorialist  https://t.co/sjZAggQbpo
@sondy @brianwolven ❤️❤️
@brianwolven @sondy to be fair  my mom is quite tech-savvy. she just like sending things on paper :)
@evolscientist @PlanetDr @USPS @sondy I'm not stupid enough to ever expect anything out of the 21230 folks
@PlanetDr @USPS @sondy actually I somehow just got 6 sheets. + a few sheets of forever global moons!
@PlanetDr @USPS @sondy NoooooooooooOOOOOOoooooooooo  I was going to wait half an hour to buy because of obnoxiousness of making an account:(
@astrotweeps webex?
@astrotweeps damn!
@mcnees yep
@sondy get a super good cooler
@astrotweeps is "innate talent" even the relevant metric?
@astrotweeps wow.
@astrotweeps have you ever lived more than 100 miles from where you grew up?
@astrotweeps hey  John  what's an echelle?
@astrotweeps lolz #oh1997
@astrotweeps O.O
@astrotweeps the internet makes knocking soooooo much easier
@astrotweeps wouldn't work nowadays :/
Yeah so apparently my team lead  @JohnDebes  is running @astrotweeps this wk. I wonder if he'll livetweet meetings? https://t.co/GK4UOGALxp
@astrotweeps canceled meeting time is the bestest time
@astrotweeps the @stsci lists are likely more up to date / complete
@astrotweeps @FimusTauri see also: if @HubbleTelescope directly overhead Baltimore  it's closer to @stsci than Boston is !
@starstryder sex without worries about pregnancy!!!
@JohnDebes @josh_sokol yep
@josh_sokol I am? :)
@biochembelle @DrMRFrancis wait. Wait wait. ALL replies get seen by ALL of my followers?! da fuk?
@mcnees end of an era
@mcnees s/men/women/
@kevinriggle @sondy (is this in response to https://t.co/FrZ6UxhRUO ?) (i'm totally stoked)
@brianwolven @markgurwell @owlbar (neither had i)
@NASAWebbTelescp @astraughnomer the JWST version of https://t.co/ZRqpvZRcb7 ? :)
@NASAWebbTelescp @astraughnomer fair enough :)
@astraughnomer btw I loved loved loved all those pics....the only woman in the room was also the only scientist 😍
@astraughnomer Bill Nye effect?
@brianwolven @abbey_burger @OtherOrbScience On menu. "Baltimore burger"  #omnomnom
@brianwolven damn  now i want a crab dip bacon cheeseburger. cc @Abbey_Burger
@starstryder !
@brianwolven the @OwlBar has a good crap dip pizza
@astrokatey ahahahahahahaha
@jegpeek @yongAstro currently watching https://t.co/K31Tl71bpU
@PeterDEdmonds @josh_sokol probably some planetary atmospheres that succeed
@PeterDEdmonds @josh_sokol VERY few examples where actual spectra are visually shown rather than illustrations of interpretations of results
@JohnDebes for the older kids I wonder who much of it is affected by how stupidly early we have the school day start
@JohnDebes @sarahkendrew I'm so glad I turned off notifications for that group.
@mcnees isn't that weird tho? "I like this place but I can't say why"
@mcnees it's the next morning and i'm still kind of sad i don't have an answer to this  having spent upwards of 4 months cumulative there
@Astro_BL what was the most enlightening thing you learned ?
@mcnees I'm honestly not sure
@mcnees damn I miss Santa Barbara
@mcnees BOOO NO IV STAY IN SB OR AT LEAST GOLETA
@mcnees omg ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Santa Barbara
@BonnieMeinke @groorg1 @artologica @asrivkin @brianwolven @ArtscapeBmore @stsci this makes me so happy
@mcnees lolz
@astrotweeps Hi Michael!
@groorg1 @YAE_STSCI of interest: https://t.co/Gm3cPULgbl

@Alex_Parker @PlanetDr @lukedones [ insert spoiler quote here ]
@PlanetDr @Alex_Parker @lukedones and @deltacarina can hear it on the chimney https://t.co/7TU3XMM39m
@PlanetDr @Alex_Parker @lukedones two more and we hit a record https://t.co/vA38s9dJ14
@BadPhysics @MerriamWebster they are and it's fantastic
@Summer_Ash @lukedones @mcnees @DrMRFrancis https://t.co/rprUZYOVE1
@Summer_Ash @DrMRFrancis is there a link or screenshot anywhere?
@AstroKatie @PeterDEdmonds @RachelFeltman it's a "mentor had a good set of data"-project. same with finding planets.
@jegpeek @sdssurveys "same same....but different"
@JohnDebes @astrokiwi it also says you're on the COS/STIS Instrument team :)
@JohnDebes tbh started as "what the hell have i done in the last year that i need to put on my scieval" so hopefully i'll keep it uptodate?
@JohnDebes @astrokiwi I used to have "last updated" on the pages. Might need to add that again!
@Summer_Ash Cool! @AstroAthens was in one of our first #BDNYC cohorts (I think) &amp; it's awesome to see her active on the outreach scene!
@MissAerospace @Summer_Ash @TrueSciPhi Ha  good eye!
Matching auto-replies from @jen_gupta as evidence of how fun her job is! ;)
@DrRob_Thacker @vrooje @startorialist (there are discount codes on site like @zazzle all the time)
@mcnees Bonkers is putting it mildly!
@mrtommyb @badreligion @elsisrad Hope you enjoy @againstme  too!
@jradavenport @aussiastronomer That I can live with (I hope)
@aussiastronomer @jradavenport That's what baby leave is  right? ;)
@aussiastronomer @jradavenport NOW I NEED TO MAKE A PARODY VIDEO OF THIS!!!!!
@aussiastronomer You magnificent genius! (I had missed it)
@aussiastronomer I wish it were that easy! Non-tenured+parental leave = quiet Emily :(
@aussiastronomer Yes indeed! 'Reasonable accommodations' etc. etc. etc. I'm sure HR knows about them.
@Jeyhan @kevinschawinski @HdxAcademy @JonHaidt Could also be small number statistics - 10x less compared to other fields
@stoutde Exactly.
@cmp150writes @StarTalkRadio Also  planets can be detected by observing a star 'wobble' ever so slightly as the planets orbit.
@cmp150writes @StarTalkRadio If the timing of the shadows changes slightly  that's evidence for more planets in the system.
@cmp150writes @StarTalkRadio We have evidence that multi-planet systems are common  but we're still not able to detect the smallest/furthest
@mikamckinnon Tragedy of Sandy in Staten Island partially caused by false alarm of Irene the previous year  bc people delayed evacuation :(
@abigailStev @badreligion Awesome! You might enjoy this: https://t.co/jCR62G7eqN cc @jegpeek
@jegpeek What's not to love about a band featuring the Brian May of bio/punk? ;)
So I described @SOFIAtelescope as a 747 with a @HubbleTelescope in the back (they're about the same diameter mirrors). To @DoctorGraffin.
I had brought @NASA &amp; @SOFIAtelescope stickers. One needs no explanation  but the other hadn't seen first light yet.
Thank you @sondy  and @hubbahubble &amp; @berkeleyjess  for leading the field in speaking out. https://t.co/urUp3rrJRj #astroSH #astroally
@astro_alexis @jfaherty @kellecruz @SIPL68 Thanks so much!
@SIPL68 I have not seen this before - Thanks! Any chance you could scan the whole article or send more info?
@JacquelynGill Reminds me of this: https://t.co/GkuzUmamJb
So many familiar faces - and a @startorialist front &amp; center! https://t.co/iNKYRzKCiA
@mcnees It's a curse. You have it  I have it  @nialldeacon has it...
@mcnees Is this a threat or a challenge? It's been a while since I made a new parody video....
@UrbanAstroNYC @sarahcottentail @StarTalkRadio @Summer_Ash ➡️bucket list
@UrbanAstroNYC @sarahcottentail That would basically be @startorialist on @StarTalkRadio  which totally has to happen at some point!
@aussiastronomer At UCLA we used to share iTunes libraries on the network  which was fun. I think @ikashell had the Little Mermaid!
@aussiastronomer PART OF YOUR WOOOOOORLD
@jegpeek @Summer_Ash Do we call leading dudes patriarchs? Founding fathers  I guess. I don't like implying 'mothering' as women's value.
@Summer_Ash @jegpeek I'd love to find out! Maria Mitchell Observatory &amp; Swope Telescope  seem to be doing okay.
@jegpeek @Summer_Ash But an even better way to honor matriarchs (what a word) is to make more of them.
@jegpeek @Summer_Ash Naming after a women: fine. Randomly assigning female gender despite overwhelmingly male team/field: bullshit.
@aussiastronomer  Good idea! I see twitches from the outside  but no recognizable features yet.
@Summer_Ash @aschwortz Truth!
@mcnees Wait till you see what I've got already - there's more for babies &amp; kids than for adults!
@ShenovaFashion Aww  thanks!
@aomawa We'd love it if you sent us photos of you wearing them for @startorialist! Cc @astronobeads
@kejames I've only done annual reports so far  and all but one were approved very quickly with no further communication.
@chris_tibbs https://t.co/PpdSWGsnhs
@murdomesser But @NASAWebb (&amp; @NASA_TESS) will help us understand these *types* of planets &amp; their atmospheres.
@murdomesser I'm not sure... might be too bright of a target for @NASAWebb! JWST will focus on transiting planets  not RV planets like this.
@startorialist Oops  of course not! Boo  @target!
@sarahcottentail @StarkeyStardust @DrFunkySpoon It's your world  we're just sciencing in it 💖💖💖
Heyyyyyyy we are getting very close to nice round numbers of followers (base ten) for @startorialist on Twitter  Instagram  &amp; Tumblr...
@sarahcottentail Luckily the guy was harmless and very polite. I am amazed I held it together for that long!
@pkgw @jasonleecurtis_ @jradavenport Fair compensation &amp; benefits makes it easier for many to participate in science.
@pkgw @jasonleecurtis_ @jradavenport Agreed  but for different reasons. Research=job in order to value time  effort  skills  etc.
@abigailStev Also @megschwamb @sarahkendrew @niais might be able to help!
@AdamFrank4 Planetary-mass object  until it is proven to have formed around a star!
@StarTalkRadio @planetjuneberry Yup  that's me! Wardrobe by/because of @startorialist  for all your #Astrofashion needs!
I'm in a posting frenzy at @startorialist so I won't RT them all  but this is one of my faves! https://t.co/3agNsIHUjC
@aventureralicia Thanks for the photo! Mind if I post it on @startorialist?
@reneehlozek Love your research group hashbrown! #hnauts
@keckobservatory @JohnDebes Autocorrect or inter-instrumental rivalry? ;)
@JohnDebes Is it still being called NIRSpec to distinguish from @keckobservatory instrument?
@demitrimuna People or ... old white dudes? I am not surprised in the least.
@jradavenport @merrdiff Theater gels are also super fun to play with when experimenting with light! Esp. sample sets w/ transmission curves.
@jradavenport @merrdiff @kgarofali @PeterYoachim @brettmor A spruce goose? (https://t.co/ohhtSB5pLB)
@jradavenport @merrdiff @kgarofali @PeterYoachim @brettmor Titanic was the biggest  fanciest ship of its time! It just happened to sink.
@aussiastronomer I feel like that's typical of new jobs: firehose of info you can't process at the beginning  then random drips later on!
@aussiastronomer Oh! 'Weird' is not the word I would use...🤑
@aussiastronomer Yikes! It is nontrivial to go from grant to paycheck (even after getting the grant!)  but it is oh so worth it.
@aussiastronomer My 9-month salary is paid over 12 months. If I have summer salary from a grant  it ~doubles my paycheck!
@startorialist @w00ki33 So jealous! Give her an extra 🙌 from me!
@pkgw @dstndstn https://t.co/tkio14HHg9
@PlanetDr @astrobetter @enceladude Yay! I still use it myself  and thank past Emily for sparing no detail.
I'm bringing fabric posters on @astronomyontap  @startorialist  &amp; #Astro101 labs to the @sdssurveys collaboration meeting  because I can!
My @startorialist outfit for #SpeedScience at @AMNH tonight! https://t.co/Q1c1HzEYRN
@mikamckinnon That's exactly what we do with @astronomyontap! I'm still looking for someone to start Geology on the Rocks... 😜
@jegpeek @astro_alexis You should be asking  what's taking the rest of astronomy so long to catch up? ;)
How nerdy would it be if I asked @EllenStofan to sign my Venus First Day of Issue envelope? @USPS @WorldStampShowN https://t.co/WJsih7P9SV
@astrokatey APS offers ~$10k grants  but competition is tough. I wish @AAS_Office did something similar  even if it were less $$$.
@Summer_Ash @astropixie @startorialist One AAS Hack Day  @eblur27 set up @IFTTT for us  just after we launched (so 2014 I think)
@mcnees Oh good  cuz I already lost 5 minutes trying to figure that one out...!
@mcnees I like to think he's the same character in SV and Freaks &amp; Geeks...
@GoAstroMo @browndwarfs @EllieInSpace Maybe try @AnnorlundaInc? Small company specializing in short ebooks.
@jegpeek nope  unfortunately not - we only have October 2013 &amp; March 2016 events.
@jegpeek @rhaegal records &amp; edits @AoTATX for YouTube  though!
@jegpeek Not usually. Sometimes @waystationbk has streaming that's recorded  but we only have two events  one saved &amp; one online.
@jegpeek @MarsRovers Yeah  even (especially?) when @NASAjpl does it  it's gross. Why not just... hire women  and pay them fairly!
Sometimes only @metasimpsons &amp; @Summer_Ash's @startorialist posts can get me through a long Monday...
@hubbahubble DON'T MIND IF I DO!!!   (power's back  whew)
@PeterDEdmonds And the one where he throws the radio down the well!
@pkgw I should have included you in my original tweet! You can be BDNYC-North ;)
The stories behind @astronomyontap  @startorialist  &amp; my 'secret' identity! https://t.co/173kocidn3
@Summer_Ash Twinsies!!! And @startorialist is on there!
@Summer_Ash @startorialist I bow to your witty captions! (Yours should go on the Instagram!)
@dalcantonJD @jegpeek IKR?!? I only learned about it at AMNH! I point it out every chance I get.
@jegpeek Do you know what happened to Brontosaurus? That's the *real* Pluto of the dinosaurs!
@iva_momcheva @KellySchwark @YurisNight I think there was one (at a planetarium?) upstate  at least in 2014...
@DustinGrowick @drunkascheese @startorialist I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL ALL THE PUNS ARE USED! Also  SEAtorialist for marine bio fashion!
@drunkascheese @DustinGrowick We're all over @ShenovaFashion at @startorialist!
@michelle_lmc @PBarmby Love those mid-conference runs!
@hubbahubble Absolutely  if it's physics related. ;)
@brianwolven @niais 👏👏👏 That took me a second
@mcnees Oh they were not that far off. Another guy lived on dropped fruit for a summer (i.e.  not even killing plants). Indie store.
@astronomyblog Compilation post sounds right - compost for short ;)
@aussiastronomer (I am getting my mass/radius ratios confused - bad astronomer!)
@aussiastronomer Is mini-Neptune definitely distinct from Neptune? I think I meant to ask about 2-6 R🌍  but that's Neptune...
@aussiastronomer I mean smaller than Neptune - is it worth a different designation? (I've seen mini  sub  &amp; 'gas dwarf')
@aussiastronomer @hubbahubble @AstroDressing
@mikamckinnon I've called my pool a fluid dynamics &amp; chemistry experiment for three summers now (&amp; had varying levels of success)
@akemdin @StarTalkRadio Aww thanks  you're too sweet! More where that came from at @startorialist ;)
@UpportunityU meet @AstroOnTapCO!
@Mad_Science_Guy Today! Just a few minutes ago :)
Some days all I do on here is RT @startorialist &amp; @astronomyontap  and I'm okay with that.
@mpgroome @PaleoExplorer RAWRtorialist for a Dino version of @startorialist  but Dinos on the Rocks could work for @astronomyontap!
@mcnees @Summer_Ash @gravitate_to_me My favorite quote: 'Great minds...' something something
@Summer_Ash @natemccrady @xeni I CAN RECITE THEM ALL!
@megschwamb @GeminiObs Okay  @astronomyontap Big Island to start!
@megschwamb @GeminiObs Yay!!! Does this mean we'll have @astronomyontap Hawai'i soon? ;)
@startorialist What an awesome bag  too! What are the odds a recycled banner would have a galaxy on it?!?
@Summer_Ash 💖 Can you come by AMNH tomorrow at all? @mikamckinnon wants us to #chirpforLIGO! Or over video chat maybe?
@aussiastronomer That's 10^-55 grams  right? So they would effectively travel at c  like neutrinos?
@Summer_Ash sez you  killin' it with @startorialist posts! ;)
Hi Twitter! I'm now on @instagram (same username as here) as well as contributing to @startorialist &amp; @astronomyontap feeds! Yay! 📷⭐️📷🍻📷
@jegpeek Done and done. And I mean done. https://t.co/mVc9rr5bFm
@mcnees (You follow @metasimpsons  right?)
@mcnees You can't quote the Simpsons in your sleep? Stand back  amateur ;) https://t.co/dqY7rtcuKS
@gsnarayan Thay have to come back &amp; start classes  but hopefully next time!
@jegpeek @laurawatkins_ What? TELL ME MORE!
@_hroe @astromarkmarley @PlanetDr Seconding 'Dear Colleagues' for anything in the field (REU  grad school  post doc  faculty)
@Mad_Science_Guy Yup  and Brokeback even!
@Mad_Science_Guy Nope! It's the too obvious ones probably. ;)
@Mad_Science_Guy Nope! I might have even seen it in the theater thanks to study abroad. :)
@aussiastronomer Point Break is new! Good-bye Lenin I've seen two or three times  one of my faves.
@sarahcottentail I like 'women crushing it' better. ;)
@sarahcottentail You do a great job! I just don't like in general that 1) women get one day &amp; 2) 'crush' is form of the praise
@davidwhogg @ashpags @rhaegal @abigailStev @jegpeek There was a poster skirt submitted to @startorialist last summer IIRC (still looking)
@jradavenport @hubbahubble @laurheth @brianwolven Now we're getting somewhere....! 😆
@natemccrady @jegpeek Fine  if you want to out yourself! Would've been funnier to let people think it was Bill Murray or something...
@ban8tr @sarahkendrew @jegpeek @KyleSammin Nah  I think there's an uncertainty principle that prevents it ;)
@jegpeek My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard it from this guy... He might have been quoting you  though...
@jegpeek @sarahkendrew @KyleSammin wise person once said to me: "there are two types of people: those w/ imposter syndrome  &amp; assholes."
@cmwalla @BoingBoing @ShenovaFashion @startorialist tags aren't working right... There should be four posts!
@cmwalla @BoingBoing We love @ShenovaFashion on @startorialist! https://t.co/u4dL53yBUS
@brianwolven @mcnees @Alex_Parker @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Or find a trusted professional
@mcnees @brianwolven @Alex_Parker @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera !!!!! https://t.co/GFuRTNW91e
@Alex_Parker @brianwolven @mcnees @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera One vote for Blue Moon &amp; orange sherbet  IIRC. Dammit  now I need ice cream.
@Alex_Parker @brianwolven @mcnees @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera There's a place in Asbury Park  NJ with an amazing beer float menu.
@brianwolven @mcnees @erinleeryan I LOVE BEER FLOATS
@brianwolven @mcnees @erinleeryan well that escalated quickly! It's Sweet Action  before anyone rushes to judgement for Sam Adams
@demitrimuna This sounds like a job for @ScienceBetter!
@KarenLMasters @Summer_Ash @LucyNewnham1 @startorialist That's nice &amp; all but I would like a piece of actual cake! ;)
@mcnees I had to look up Katherine Johnson (again) but she should be a household name too: https://t.co/o1atd9QZL1
@becky1505 @BBCStargazing @tarquydrawers Sounds like a job for a UK-based @astronomyontap!
@drarnakarick Oh  oh no. :(
@jegpeek @ashpags Part 2 will start day-of. (Part 1 was a lot of work! Yinz tweet too much!)
@ashpags @jegpeek Done!
@Summer_Ash @shaka_lulu @mikamckinnon @ashpags @startorialist Did I miss anything? https://t.co/ZWdXGjKNBz
@mcnees Nothing  that's just my resting exasperation  ;)
@rachelosten @jegpeek @astronomolly @niais I got pre-check by luck &amp; it was glorious! I'm seriously considering GE even for 1-2 trips/yr
@Summer_Ash @shaka_lulu @mikamckinnon @ashpags @startorialist I think the origin story is in my tweets - should I Storify?
.@aagie @saracamnasio @astrobites Seamful Astronomy?!?!
@shannonmstirone It's @Shadowplaynyc! Highly recommended.
@jradavenport @davidwhogg @dalcantonJD @adrianprw cc @JohnDebes #aascar
@kellecruz @merrdiff Cash=time&amp;money. People doing this hard work should be (richly) compensated for it!
I'll be at the @astronomyontap &amp; @startorialist posters (248.02 &amp; 03) after the public policy plenary (~12:30pm)! #aas227
@Mad_Science_Guy @jfaherty @kellecruz @PaigeAlexisG Yes - your sources were CUNY-centric but nicely representational!
@StartsWithABang @AstroInclusive @niais @kellecruz @astrokatey talk amongst yourselves...
@StartsWithABang @AstroInclusive y'all should talk about Thursday plans...!
@GalAstronomer @merrdiff @startorialist @Summer_Ash @ashpags @MCNebrewla uh oh! Not mine  I think....
@reneehlozek Send me a selfie for the post if you'd like!
@drarnakarick https://t.co/hS0MNiAbsq
Paging @jegpeek @Summer_Ash @kellecruz to the AAS Resource Center please!
@pkgw Well then Happy Birthday! 🎉🎈🎁
@MCNebrewla @startorialist Of course not! I have two costume changes in my bag ;)
@JohnDebes @Meg_Urry Better: have the extra work be valued/compensated by the community!
@JohnDebes @Meg_Urry but this puts a lot of stress/extra work on other underrepresented minorities.
Are wearing an awesome science shirt at #aas227 today? Meet at the AAS booth at 5:30 pm for a @startorialist photo shoot!
@DrMRFrancis @Summer_Ash Wait  there are *bad* puns?!?!?!
@w00ki33 @startorialist Just you wait ;)
@aussiastronomer Cab was ~$65 with tip - worth it to split!
@JohnDebes oof yeah i'll assume driving from now on.
@JohnDebes @FlippersPizzaUS @GaylordPalms By what mode of conveyance?
@bradpholden @dalcantonJD @astronomeara @astronomolly Real people! Cirque de Soliel I think? Juggling  turned into acrobatics later.
@dalcantonJD @astronomeara @astronomolly Here is the view from my room (you're welcome): https://t.co/NkOKYunLCv
@JedidahIslerPhD @kellecruz @kevinschawinski Yes  &amp; public areas have free wifi. Should've specified for *in-room* wifi
@ashpags @iva_momcheva @johngizis @eblur27 @Summer_Ash @jegpeek @janagrc Yes  for @startorialist #TshirtTuesday of course! ;)
@jegpeek Stalled at Step 0! Safety pins &amp; stitch witchery it is. CC @ashpags @erinleeryan @rhaegal @kellecruz
@jegpeek @kellecruz @ashpags @rhaegal I could also bring jewelry findings &amp; tools....
We're hacking fabric posters! @jegpeek  are you bringing the sewing machine? #aas227  https://t.co/2DRGLOgVvb
@jegpeek @ashpags What were we talking about?
@jegpeek @ashpags But the method was genius: wrap in cardboard  tape kitchen towel as handle. Only problem was baffled German security.
@jegpeek @ashpags Internationally.
@jegpeek @ashpags Confession: I once transported a computer tower as carry-on luggage. It was 2000 &amp; I was poor.
@jegpeek @ashpags If it were me I'd say yes  but since it's you I say doooooooo iiiiiiiiiiit! ;)
@ashpags @jegpeek I'll bring safety pins! We'll need scissors  too... Anyone checking a bag?
@vrooje Me  too  but the @startorialist poster last year was very image heavy so I think it'll be awesome. No more ink-wasting-guilt!
Glancing at @TrueSciPhi I noticed me  @sarahkendrew  &amp; @carolune are earliest adopters among female astros &gt;1k on Twitter. Neat! #dotastro
@reneehlozek Bummer  but yay!!! Go get 'em  Professor Hlozek!
Everyone's bringing StarWomen shirts to #AAS227 right? @reneehlozek @iva_momcheva @johngizis @eblur27 @Summer_Ash @jegpeek @ashpags @janagrc
@ashpags @startorialist @Summer_Ash You took a photo! ... Why did't we take a proper photo?!
Pretty cool that a @Lottie_dolls is on the #ISS! Even more cool if she weren't the only woman there right now. https://t.co/eWQBNeAnVO
Tons of @startorialist posts today! Prepare for the RTs in 3... 2... 1... 🚀
@startorialist Attn: @kellecruz
@mikamckinnon Is there a cure??? ('Where can I get some of these placebos?!')
@mikamckinnon PCL! I like that it has a TLA ;)
The real reason to study diffuse gas is not mass  but formation of stars &amp; galaxies. --@jegpeek
On images of diffuse hydrogen: 'It looks so interesting because there's a lot of information in there' --@jegpeek
Astronomy has standard candles (known intrinsic brightness)  @jegpeek uses standard crayons: objects with known colors.
Beautiful slide on dust by @eblur27!  @jegpeek https://t.co/ncVYy5ScXT
Accepted fact: most of the baryonic ('normal' or non-dark matter) matter in the Universe is diffuse gas *between* galaxies! @jegpeek
And he already scored irony points for writing his Twitter handle@on the chalkboard. @jegpeek
Today @jegpeek is visiting @AMNH astronomers to talk about his work on the diffuse Universe. He wins for earliest reference: Ptolmey (155).
@sondy @Summer_Ash I am totally lobbying @kellecruz to have us be a part of @ScienceBetter!
@kejames She's probably used to being fangirled by kids  but I imagine it takes a while to get used to the adult scientists ;)
@kejames !!!!!! I saw her at a Timbers game w/ her wife (plays for the Thorns)  &amp; it took all my willpower not to fangirl. Kinda wish I had!
@brianwolven Yes  like that! It easier that I thought. Although it would be nice if the text margins were also a circle...
@PeterDEdmonds @startorialist Thanks so much! Means a lot  especially from fellow scientists.
@StartsWithABang @Summer_Ash (Can we do something about this astrofashion dark energy?)
@StartsWithABang @Summer_Ash I've seen them somewhere before  but not posted/drafted yet. Thanks!
@ashpags @Summer_Ash @erinleeryan Also the day @jegpeek came up with the name @startorialist according to my DMs! ⭐️💖😍
@PenguinGalaxy Just a short convo with the actors &amp; audience afterwards. Very nice  but a hard act to follow!
@PenguinGalaxy I think liberty might have been taken w/ interactions  but it was wonderful to see personalities &amp; stories brought to life.
@PenguinGalaxy I don't think it was  but I don't remember the name (Shapley I would have remembered...). The guys are credited as #1  2  &amp; 3
@PenguinGalaxy Yes! Also Pickering  Russell  &amp; a 3rd guy. (Try waiting/reloading link? Mine loaded after a second.)
@astronomolly You're hired! I'm so bad at galaxies ;) @startorialist @BeckyQoF @Etsy
@kellecruz @Summer_Ash @janerrigby @astronomeara Wait yeah no I don't need help totally fine lalala I can't hear you!!!!!1!!
@astronomeara @Summer_Ash @kellecruz @janerrigby Go on....
@JPMajor @startorialist Thanks! What was the image you used? (My wallet is glad that doesn't exist anymore!)
@JPMajor 'had printed up'? Tell me more! Can I post to @startorialist?
@StarTalkRadio Oh  thanks! I do on my other accounts  @startorialist &amp; @astronomyontap :)
@mcnees two clips are here: https://t.co/cmxFD6UQif Not sure if the full episode will be online.
@UpportunityU Absolutely! Can I post your photo to @startorialist? Where is the hat from?
My necklace is c/o @EEJewellery (space shuttle!) and my bracelet is by @muhLISuhjewelry (Butterfly Nebula!) #StarTalkTV
Yay  @startorialist shout out!!!! #StarTalkTV
Mentored by @AstroAdric while working with #BDNYC I should add. @AllPlanets @PlanetImager @SETIInstitute
@LauraJaneGrace you might just be mentioned on #StarTalk on @NatGeoChannel this Sunday  just sayin...
@kevinschawinski Yup. They've talked constantly during class all semester  and I've asked them to stop many times.
@mcnees Do you follow @metasimpsons? It embiggens the smallest tweet.
@mcnees B-oof-urns?
Both @Summer_Ash &amp; I have (multiple?) full-time jobs  but you wouldn't think it with our prolific @startorialist posting! ⭐️🔥⭐️
@mattkenworthy @Astro_Wright @cosmos4u @JohnDebes @steinly0 Decade? Century?! Never?!?!? Who knows!!!!
@mattkenworthy @Astro_Wright @cosmos4u @JohnDebes @steinly0 I am totally starting a betting pool for J1407 vs KIC 8462852! Match of the...
@astrokiwi @AstroKatie @sarahkendrew @jegpeek @astrofrog Oh. Good. God. I've never heard of this before and now 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
@aussiastronomer Ha! I always wondered where terminology came from for the shoes (usually I say 'heels'  but these are specifically pumps)
@startorialist @vafarmboy @evoque It is the least useful  most awesome purse I own. 🚀😜
@merrdiff @GeekGirlCon @dustchick @see_the_sky @SolarDawnB Lovely to see @StarstuffShirts &amp; @w00ki33 designs! &amp; the people of course :)
@the_n_nicole Will you be our @startorialist correspondent? Eagerly awaiting photos!
Hey  Hollywood! I'm in the database of the @SciEntEx now - call me  we'll talk science!
@KarenLMasters @startorialist @Spoonflower And I second @CelestialBuddy recommendation - they are worth every penny!
@KarenLMasters @startorialist Sorry I'm late to the party! There is Jupiter fabric on @Spoonflower: https://t.co/chsam9VE5T
@mcnees @BadAstronomer You can by emailing Laura (see my TL)
@owlice @startorialist I DIDN'T KNOW MY LIFE WAS INCOMPLETE UNTIL NOW.
@mcnees Awareness of cognitive dissonance does lead to learning. Thank you for listening.
.@seanmcarroll @mcnees Not cognitive dissonance  actually  but a well-known ploy of predators to gain trust/sympathy.
@astronomolly @StartsWithABang @niais @Pillownaut @astroengine @dalcantonJD Sure  senior faculty. I know grads/postdocs confronted him.
@StartsWithABang @niais @Pillownaut @astroengine @dalcantonJD Lots of people stepped in  but none was powerful enough to make him stop.
@hubbahubble @berkeleyjess @astrojohnjohn Thank you.
@Summer_Ash IKR?! We should start a shared @startorialist closet....
@startorialist @GirlsWillBeHQ I think @wandsci's kids might like some of these designs!
@aussiastronomer @startorialist @Gap Pic for the blog  please? :)

@astrobellatrix @eilatg @kevinschawinski That was for their discovery  this is for discovering they have mass?
I'm RTing @startorialist frequently this week as we promote our #scicomm survey: you've been warned! Take the survey: http://t.co/3itpSzoBbS
I sat down to write one @startorialist post &amp; ended up with 10 new drafts. I think I have a problem.
@aussiastronomer Props for using his past self as an example though!
@aussiastronomer I read this backward and was VERY concerned until I saw the #badtalk was intentional!
@astronomyblog @w00ki33 More info here: https://t.co/x37Fy6PAnC
@ashpags @Summer_Ash @startorialist Would you believe I just got one in Ireland?!? So summer can have that one! 🎁😘💖
@merrdiff Yup  @ruthangus mentioned binaries as a contaminant! But most binaries are wide enough to be useful I think.
.@NASAKepler has allowed us to study the *population* of exoplanets for the first time  &amp; @ruthangus studies its dependence on stellar age.
.@ruthangus is taking a break from #AstroHackWeek to tell us about her research on stellar ages &amp; rotation @AMNH! @NASAKepler is the 'star'!
@phildelio @startorialist Nice! I'd estimate half my nerdy t-shirts are from @PercivalLowell!
@StartsWithABang @Summer_Ash Ha! Almost the polar opposite - she's LCDR in the U.S. Navy!
@Summer_Ash @StartsWithABang It did! We weren't sure  then we found another pic... I think I fixed it in another post? Oh well! ;)
@StartsWithABang @Summer_Ash But... it's actually my twin sister! No  really!!!
Thank you  @IStandWithAhmed  for making a @NASA t-shirt a symbol of acceptance as well as awesomeness!
@Summer_Ash @startorialist I loved watching these!!!
@natemccrady @astronomeara @johannateske @niais Aww  nuts. But you can tell the colors apart on your version?
@astronomeara @johannateske @niais Last comment: @kellecruz has students use them on screens and/or color their own!
@astronomeara @johannateske @niais @natemccrady (Doesn't print nearly as neon as it looks on my screen  but I kinda wish it did.)
@astronomeara @johannateske @niais Mine's a different color palate... Better for colorblind maybe? (@natemccrady?) http://t.co/EMpfGND36e

Excited to start my fifth (whoa) year at @csinews! Back to #Astro101  with a 100% more @startorialist wardrobe. http://t.co/p5JUltgh4k
@mcnees They're missing 'STARtorialist' &amp; 'STARtorialist enabler'! ;)
@IAU_org Any comments on closing remarks by Incoming General Secretary Benvenuti?
@hormiga @kejames @ProfLikeSubst Agreed  unfortunately. Finding good pre-submission reviewers is important but challenging networking task.
Pleasure to film with Donna Hanover at @AMNH today! Look for this @startorialist outfit on @cunytv in December. http://t.co/wZdo5xbMMk
@Mad_Science_Guy @AMNH It's there  just under the floor unless we're using it! :)
@pkgw @AstroCaroline @jfaherty @kellecruz Bonus points to the first person who gets a tattoo of one of them! ;) 💪🏼 (I would I f I were Joe!)
My Twitter accounts collide this week as I host an @astronomyontap event featuring awesome @startorialist designers! http://t.co/MWWRFh2uSK

Quick search tells me yes  retrograde planet is a hot Jupiter w/ more distant  massive companion. @astrojohnjohn @Astro_Wright @hubbahubble
Astronomers: are there multi-exoplanet systems with both prograde &amp; retrograde planets? @astrojohnjohn @Astro_Wright @hubbahubble
@PeterDEdmonds @DrMRFrancis Probably! NRAO press release I saw had a whole paragraph on BDs  but I'm not sure whether the object was one.
@DrMRFrancis I didn't mean to imply that! I think it's an interesting discussion.
@DrMRFrancis It's great to see a discussion of the terms so thanks for that! These are pet peeves of mine.
@DrMRFrancis On the other hand  Jupiter is in no way  shape  or form a failed brown dwarf  because Jupiter formed like a planet.
@DrMRFrancis It's an appropriate description for a free-floating brown dwarf (I.e.  one that formed like a star).
.@DrMRFrancis Besides  we astronomers love brown dwarfs even if we they are 'failed' stars: http://t.co/9baYYA8XfE ;) @knitted_bd
.@DrMRFrancis I'm in favor of 'failed star' especially bc it makes more sense to distinguish BDs from planets by formation rather than mass.
@PlanetDr (That account plagiarizes  according to @GradElitist)
@NoisyAstronomer @Summer_Ash You can borrow this for starters! Inspired by @reneehlozek  made by @Alex_Parker http://t.co/IRbDNbQvbG
@johannateske @startorialist @jazztronomy @brizbby Did I see it on Facebook maybe? Even the acronym would help.
@hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI @astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @Stardustspeck Not me  either. I hope to follow along on twitter tho!
@Mad_Science_Guy Husband looked at plants I weeded &amp; did't see anything obvious. I have half a mind to bag it all up and drag it to doctor!
@Mad_Science_Guy Unfortunately I react badly to steroids. I wish I could tolerate them enough for them to work!
@Mad_Science_Guy Calling a dermatologist today. I know I'm pretty allergic to everything environmental  but this is over the top.
@DrRubidium 'X was just joking'
@Mad_Science_Guy Sources online says it can take 2-3 days  @berkemeyerjj said up to 2 weeks. :/ I'm washing all my clothes just in case.
@Mad_Science_Guy Okay  whew. This is most definitely a very delayed reaction. I do like ruling things out at the very least.
@Mad_Science_Guy I did have a mark with dark spots before the rash/blisters got worse... I'll look into it.
@Mad_Science_Guy Not really... Are you thinking Mosquitos? We have a ton. This started like lots of bad bites  but got worse
@Mad_Science_Guy Oh I'm doubling down on  Benadryl  Allegra  and every topical known to humankind.
@Mad_Science_Guy No woods  but I weeded a very overgrown part of my yard two weeks ago. And I'm allergic to everything environmental :/
@Mad_Science_Guy @UrbanAstroNYC I definitely have blisters  and it's been four days. I'll look into sumac more. Thanks!
@DavidBflower Thanks! I've seen three doctors with different diagnoses  hence my paranoia...
We posted all the @MaisonValentino universe print we could find at @startorialist today! https://t.co/U9LBdyCfkQ

@LeMoustier @astrokiwi @Alex_Parker I bet @startorialist knows how to make this happen! ;)
@trueanomalies @Summer_Ash @startorialist Thanks!!! 💖
@eteq @astrofrog @biphenyl You usually have to request one as grant PI  typically many limitations. I should say more paperwork *upfront*.
@astrofrog @eteq Many institutions have 'purchase cards' for spending grant money - more paperwork  but no fronting/reimbursement!
@marshallperrin @Astro_Wright @StellarPlanet @jfaherty Never tell us the odds!  Seriously tho  another transiting ring system'd be AWESOME.
@labroides Seriously  the world needs @startorialist for marine bio! Start by thinking of a nice punny portmanteau...
@demitrimuna The ones I've been to have been awesome! I'll probably miss this one  but I'm thinking about the Lincoln show in July...
@demitrimuna I'm missing tonight (in Montreal!)  but I will be back on Sunday... Which album are they playing?
@UrbanAstroNYC @IntrepidMuseum 👏👏👏
@labroides @Odysseyblog Marine bio needs a @startorialist equivalent! (You have some gorgeous @MaisonValentino collections to start with...)
@da_neekster @Summer_Ash @startorialist Reminds me: can you send me roller derby pics? Working on a big post!
@merrdiff Sorry  it was @NASA: http://t.co/qZBMtwvaIT @NSF has this page: https://t.co/SksKY444nH
@merrdiff I think there is one for @NSF now...
One last tweet: @Summer_Ash is tweeting from #IA2015 for @STARtorialist which is making me very happy 💖
@michelle_lmc @runnersworld @saucony WOW!!!!!!! Awesome!!!!!
@aoifemcl It is! That has put the biggest smile on my face! You might like @startorialist  too - my small ways of normalizing women in STEM.
@UrbanAstroNYC @Summer_Ash @ashpags @jegpeek @reneehlozek Me either!
@verbiscer @tedstryk @lukedones Sure. I know the "clean inning" idea is widespread  but no idea if it's based in fact.
@lukedones (So bad at holding runners)
@lukedones If I had to guess  Lester is _so_ bad with people on base and the perception is relievers do better starting an inning.
@LDMay Ross is (obviously) the grizzled veteran... I think he's retiring after the World Series.
@jerry_drake @DrPhiltill And it'll be hard to tell if it's there until arrival (and even then it'll take some doing to detect).
@jerry_drake @DrPhiltill It's possible ice could be present in some of these objects  but it'll be deep down.
@jerry_drake @DrPhiltill Er...as you note in your second tweet. I should wait before responding. :)
@jerry_drake @DrPhiltill Bound water as in OH in clay minerals will be there. H2O as in ice is going to be very tough to find.
@DrPhiltill @jerry_drake For typical temps at 1 AU  it's 100s of meters loss per My. For typical NEO sizes/lifetimes  most likely ice free.
@cathomas09 Congrats on your great marathon performance! :)

@lukedones Hey  I'm just reporting.
@lukedones That's the public talk associated with this meeting  though the conference per se at the University of Montreal not McGill.

@henrycobb Ooh. Good question. Her talk was only our Solar System. I have no doubt somebody will try   not sure if GTO for them or not.
@Paladin1969 I'm not making a value judgment  just a characterization of "fries plus toppings" food. :)
@elakdawalla @tedstryk And the worst parts of reddit are vile as anywhere on the open internet (admittedly  Twitter is also in the running).
@decaelus That's a bit obscure. ;)

@PlanetDr I'd been practicing Tay-Tay for this event for a little while  not that it was obvious.
@PlanetDr @EllenStofan :D
@jtuttlekeane @elakdawalla It was competitively selected.  Seems like something that could/should have been mentioned in the proposal.
@decaelus Bodega Bar. 5:30  I believe.
@cathomas09 I suspect we both would.
@cathomas09 I would ask you to serve as Secretary of Excellence.
@brianwolven @sondy @ct_la I don't suspect anyone would stop a non-attendee spectator. I think performances are reserved for attendees.
@sondy @ct_la Rules?
@CarlyHowett @radjanirad Aren't you two supposed to be in a meeting together?
@omcintyre Legit.
@cathomas09 @NASAWebb @SNMilam I'll be right there?
I think I can hear @verbiscer screaming from here.
@megschwamb @grierja The pleasure of course was ours! :)
@megschwamb @grierja We've arrived! We have a table near the door.
@cathomas09 And I suppose I'll. E seeing you and  @SNMilam for at least some of tomorrow...
@cathomas09 @SNMilam @verbiscer @megschwamb @grierja @PlanetDr I'm triple booked at various times but will keep you posted!
@SNMilam @verbiscer @cathomas09 attn. :) https://t.co/tC5nf1sQyK
@megschwamb @grierja Sounds good! And it looks like you'll get us both. :)
@megschwamb @grierja Jen may keep napping but I'm game. When are you thinking?
@megschwamb Assuming we count as "cool" for these purposes. ;)
@megschwamb We're staying at the Hilton. We've been napping off our super-early start to the day but I might be coaxed into getting a round.
@deepbluedot Thank you  sir! :)
@cathomas09 @sir_galahead I only lost about 10 minutes  I eventually work around it. But I did feel dumb. :P
@TheyMayBeParted @nepetro It'd be a massive amount of work  though. Especially if done a la The Diary of Myles Thomas.
@TheyMayBeParted @nepetro "Another take of 'Dig A Pony' breaks down."
@TheyMayBeParted @nepetro Project for 2019: Live-tweet Get Back sessions exactly 50 years later. With scheduled tweets  presumably.
@sir_galahead @cathomas09 Those would only have been useful if I could draw a box on the data viewer with them.
@radjanirad @barbylon You can't be late to this party--it wasn't going to start without you! ;)

@lukedones Helicopter?
@a20261 I don't disagree that's what he'll be  but he should be first ballot. Especially since he's a good shot for 3000 hits.
@PlanetDr @barbylon This is William of Ockham's suspicion  along with "voting for Hillary and not admitting it".
@starstryder They apparently did this with Dole in '96  not because he was controversial but because he was obviously going to lose.
@brianwolven @OtherOrbScience @PlanetDr Too subtle.  This is Twitter. ;)
@brianwolven @PlanetDr No  no. Dehumanizing him makes it someone else's problem. He's a GOP  USA  male folks (etc etc) problem.
@PlanetDr Oh  he is a very  very sorry human being.
@gregzink Brookline  I think. :)
@Paladin1969 On the contrary  I'm kind of figuring it's much  much later than it should have been.
@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon We have to get things signed/approved by various managers  but that's true of everyone everywhere.
@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon Oh!  It was when I was at MIT.  Not APL.  Postdocs can propose for whatever at APL.
@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon This was 10-15 years ago  might be different now. Might have been specific unenthusiastic people involved.
@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon Proposing to programs other than the 2 I came with was a non-starter. But also unnecessary for my funding.
@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon ...and I definitely got the sense that reproposing to PGG was going to be a hassle. But I pushed through.
@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon It's a bit more nuanced than 140 char can hold  but my PGG was ending...
@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon And even then there were excuses/reasons I shouldn't propose to the programs where I had expiring grants.
@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon I had 2 grants when I came there  and made keeping/reproposing a condition of accepting the job.
@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon At MIT I wasn't even a postdoc--I was a research scientist. Same rules  regardless.
@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon At both LPL and MIT I needed permission of the faculty to propose. It was pro forma-ish  but not automatic.
@PlanetDr @barbylon @spacejammie And the rise/spread of soft money career paths is at odds with that kind of postdoc structure.
@PlanetDr @barbylon @spacejammie "I don't want clever young scientists competing with me for grant money" so not allowed to PI.
@PlanetDr @barbylon @spacejammie Not that people would say that if challenged  but that thinking is behind the whole system.
@PlanetDr @barbylon @spacejammie I think it's part of the outdated thinking-Postdocs are "supposed to" find faculty jobs or leave the field.
@OtherOrbScience @spacejammie Yeah  we do too.  And the Brown alum to LPL alum ratio is getting out of balance...
@darth The 90's pop-grunge band is very sad to be unrecognized.

@shaka_lulu @astrokiwi @david_kipping Nah.  They keep us honest solar system rock jockeys from getting any telescope time. ;)
@shaka_lulu @astrokiwi @david_kipping And I honestly have no idea (asteroid astronomer) what biosignatures are on Europa or Enceladus.
@shaka_lulu @astrokiwi @david_kipping Sure. I'm conflating a bit  but most layfolk think Spock/Worf/ET not tardigrades when thinking aliens.
@astrokiwi @david_kipping @shaka_lulu I think there are loads of reasons unrelated to life to love and study the universe around us. :)
@astrokiwi @david_kipping @shaka_lulu If life will mostly exist (probabilistically) where we can't interact  can we prove it's there?
@astrokiwi @david_kipping @shaka_lulu I think some people who are super-focused on astrobio are also super-focused on interacting with them.
@astrokiwi @david_kipping @shaka_lulu I assume someone is working on sci-fi about how we're just about the only surface-dwelling life? :)

@lukedones @nepetro Don't even.
@nepetro @lukedones We've been fans for ~25-30% of Red Sox history  it's not overwhelmingly crazy we'd've seen the best Red Sox player.
@nepetro @lukedones DiMaggio missed age 28-30 seasons  Greenberg 30-33. Greenberg was MVP in 1940  DiMag in 1941 (admittedly infamously).
@nepetro @lukedones Same argument is sometimes made for DiMaggio and Greenberg  though obviously not as strong a case.
@nepetro @lukedones I agree--give him those seasons back it's absolutely no question. I assume this argument only looks at accrued stats.
@lukedones And even so  Williams' career spanned integration and I'm not aware of an argument his hitting suffered.
@lukedones There is pretty much no real argument that Ortiz was better than Williams unless you put tons of weight on pre-integration issue.
@lukedones Yaz was probably better than Ortiz (I haven't looked up any stats).  Tris Speaker was unquestionably better.
@lukedones Manny Ramirez was better than Ortiz. Ortiz was often not even the best hitter in Boston's lineup  let alone ever.
@PlanetDr Could be an intentional rebellious act by a Magritte fan.

@rafi0t @sondy Will do! I don't know how this asteroid mining thing will work out  but it may be a frequent stop for many of us!
@VealSlab Should have listened to you.
#ASIME2016 is now over  and was very interesting. Thanks to @amaragraps  @JLGalache et al for organizing!
@lukedones I have been finding the Grand Duchy delightful  even given an earlier than expected last call.
@brianwolven That seems to be tomorrow night's plan.
@JLGalache Oh dear.
I also note that @JLGalache is tweeting this at #ASIME2016  but I'm going to stick it out at #ASIME. :)

@prgrmr42 Unter der MilchigWei
@JayAlver @smod2016 But I'll cheerfully concede I hadn't considered the airburst = meteor argument so may be thinking of it wrong. :)
@JayAlver @smod2016 You can have a meteor without an airburst--meteor showers are basically sand eroding via atmospheric friction.
@JayAlver @smod2016 I'm thinking the airburst is more the impact than the meteor.
@JLGalache Yeah  I'm doing IAD-Frankfurt  then there straight to LUX.  I considered taking a train from Paris  but should work.
@JLGalache What route are you taking? I don't leave here until early evening and get there mid-morning tomorrow...

@PlanetDr @AnnaUnderTheSun @HannahSus @PlanetSabine Surely we can point her to the Trash Wheel though  right?
@prgrmr42 It does make one wonder whether R2 is taunting him about his status in all the beeps that we don't understand (but 3PO does).
@prgrmr42 In the Pr*ls R2 shows up  is recognized as a hero  and sticks around to be useful. C3PO is much less independent.
@prgrmr42 Oddly  I feel like R2-D2 was never actually "owned" in the narrative in the way that C3PO was.
@HannahSus @PlanetDr @PlanetSabine @AnnaUnderTheSun I never got a brochure. I was just handed a Jaz drive and given a badge.

@JessicaNoviello @astrotweeps I see one grad student on the past schedule. Good question for @megschwamb et al  though!
@TheyMayBeParted @nepetro Whether they figured they'd lose their edge if they rested  or if such a break might have staved off burnout?
@TheyMayBeParted @nepetro It does make one wonder about whether it even occurred to them to take a break.
@TheEarthStory Yeah  it was an empty offer/threat on my part.
@lukedones Yep  I can't find it either. :/
@lukedones It was a response to a similarly named Zolotov paper  IIRC.

@prgrmr42 Don't know if you're watching  but I've never seen a double play like that before.  He was like the Usain Bolt of slowness there.
@tedstryk Then we are in violent agreement! :)
@tedstryk But that's not unreasonable given the likely time horizon of such a mission.... :)
@tedstryk I think actual operations of an interstellar mission that's trying to look at the planets is under-considered.
@tedstryk I completely agree  but it'd also be a huge issue if you're not going to slow down after spending all that time/$$ to get there.
@tedstryk ...though of course such a mission would cross 1 AU distance in something like 5-10 hours unless they slowed down...
@tedstryk I was imagining LORRI on a Proxima Centauri mission earlier today. I think it'd get 40 pixels across Earth from 1 AU away...
@tedstryk I thought NH had an outside chance  but figured Galileo probably had the best resolution.
@tedstryk Pioneer 11 doesn't still hold the record for highest spatial resolution on Jupiter  though  I'd imagine?

@sondy I've had insufficient exposure to Montreal bagels to do an actual objective comparison. But NY pizza is 1000x better than Chicago's.

@PlanetDr Can the O in OBSTREPEROUS stand for "obstreperous"?
@PlanetDr @brianwolven @Paladin1969 @Alex_Parker Hmm. ⊗ could also be considered a symbol of obstreperousness  couldn't it?
@PlanetDr @brianwolven @Paladin1969 @Alex_Parker Persistent obstreperousness is key to our* charm.   *I am also charming in other ways. ⊗
@brianwolven @Paladin1969 @PlanetDr Yeah. I think I've been on Twitter for 8 years?

@spacejammie @AmyMainzer Discovery PIs often do that sort of thing once they get into Phase A to stay away from paparazzi. Ask @ltelkins.
@spacejammie Maybe @AmyMainzer was in costume? I hear that's an LA kind of thing. Or going incognito?
@lukedones I had a definite urge to walk around the Trump casino in Vegas and yell at babies when I was recently there.

@sondy @Alex_Parker @erinleeryan That's the plan. We're making sure it's not required  but we certainly hope for Goldstone  Arecibo  and GB.
@lukedones He's a monster.
@PlanetDr Correct  perhaps along with an email to project leadership explaining why they won't be exploiting you further.
@cosettegilmour Retro? I bought that one new. :|

@fcain @storybywill @prgrmr42 Came for the asteroid moons  left satisfied. :)
@Astro_Adept ...but others are ~50 AU away. And you'd have to wait ~10-15 years for them to be closer than from Earth. Tradeoffs.
@Astro_Adept It's also not necessarily clear how much help it would be--TNOs are ~40 AU away  at Saturn some of them are ~30 AU away...
@Astro_Adept That'd depend a lot on the details.  It is technically similar to Galileo/Cassini but without the planet to help you slow down.
@PlanetDr Tell me the thing he hasn't seen it do is give out free donuts and/or cocktails.

@Astro_Adept Sure! :) Here's slide sets from proponents: https://t.co/VQ935Nh8fH https://t.co/zHMzaYZ8UI I'll see if I can find a paper...
@Astro_Adept Here's a non-technical article about possible missions: https://t.co/qopmH0KZ5v
@Astro_Adept Very true. Since Voyager 2 went by we can only observe them telescopically  though there are proposals to return.
@Astro_Adept @NatGeo Yep  on my mental list but I grabbed these first. :)
@Astro_Adept For instance: https://t.co/0ppMvbub7C  https://t.co/kgZDHEJMny  https://t.co/zsWVL3mLdu (not all equally huge discoveries)
@dbindsch @starstryder The fact that "discovering water on Mars" is a planetary science punchline indicates you're not the only worrier.
@neilebowles Then turn around and say it should be funded because we think it's important.
@neilebowles I understand  but I think that's a circular argument--we say it's important because we'll think it'll get funded...
@starstryder No single thing  but a few unrelated minor things in rapid succession added to a multi-decade unease moved me to tweet.

@prgrmr42 I hated Ramirez  but he was absolutely one of the 4-5 best hitters I have ever seen while I've been a baseball fan.
@LDMay And IIRC  Nats fans had to be taught not to do it at first--they thought it was just what you do at baseball games. :)
@AstroCook @spacejammie @brianwolven @jtuttlekeane @AscendingNode @Alex_Parker It looks like it'll be ~7 between NF AOs.
@AstroCook @spacejammie @brianwolven @jtuttlekeane @AscendingNode @Alex_Parker That's the recommendation for Discovery. ~5 years for NF.
@spacejammie @brianwolven @AstroCook @jtuttlekeane @AscendingNode @Alex_Parker Not as often as the community has recommended.
@cosettegilmour Just keep thinking that. I'm sure others will set you straight ;)
@cosettegilmour I have other connections that would get me there  but I unfortunately also have previous plans for that time...
@prgrmr42 @brianwolven @Wikisteff @PlanetDr @plutokiller JPL offers to extract the nickel and give it to you if you give them a dollar.
@Wikisteff @PlanetDr @brianwolven I may just add some more sand to this evening's cocktails to make up for it.
@Wikisteff @PlanetDr Periodically a server grabs it just before the first sip and says "it's not quite right"  then returns with same thing.
@PlanetDr And?
@PlanetDr Fill highball 2/3 with water. Drop in 1 tsp of sand. Add single ice cube that snugly fits into glass. $30. Get a friend to pay.
@lukedones I will follow Mariano Rivera wherever he may lead me. I have a baseball bat already in my office.
@Mad_Science_Guy @benjaminsharkey the response/reaction/reminiscence would be if it had been Rickey Henderson assaulting an ump instead. 2/2
@Mad_Science_Guy @benjaminsharkey Absolutely. One of the most aggravating things about the Pine Tar Game to me is how different 1/2
@Mad_Science_Guy @benjaminsharkey Yeah  I see no reason for Bagwell to be excluded at all.
@Mad_Science_Guy @benjaminsharkey Yeah  I'd put them both in  and Clemens. But not Rose.

@Mad_Science_Guy A large fraction of North Americans use caffeine as an everyday PED. :)
@Mad_Science_Guy Yeah  that's the elephant in the room. I imagine it'll (continue to) mirror societal opinions toward drugs in general.
@gregzink And we certainly have different things that push our buttons. I have good friends I totally disagree with on A-Rod vs Pete Rose.
@gregzink We (collectively) tolerate it in sports  in music  in politics  etc. Look at coverage of Lou Reed's death  for instance.
@Mad_Science_Guy I enjoy arguing baseball. :)  But I certainly respect those who think an intangible element may exist...
@Mad_Science_Guy Ortiz cleared 40 home runs 3 times  most recently in 2006. A-Rod did it 8 times  most rcently in 2007.
@Mad_Science_Guy If you're a sabermetrics guy  A-Rod had 10 seasons with a higher WAR than Ortiz' best season.
@Mad_Science_Guy Serious question: In what aspect of the game do you think Ortiz was superior to A-Rod? Integrated over career  I mean.
Hmm. Maybe @PlanetDr will be gifted a souvenir... https://t.co/i9Gzhr6HF0

@prgrmr42 I agree it'd be better for him to drop out regardless of cause  but now these things have gained some level of "respectability".
@prgrmr42 Sure. But not at _that_ level. Party leadership hoped they could let things fizzle instead of confront Trump. Here's the result.
@prgrmr42 Or the Mexicans are rapists thing or the deporting Muslims thing or the Megan Kelly blood thing or "you can't control me so you wo

@barbylon @brianwolven @HiCommander @spacejammie  &lt;look slowly comes across face&gt; "Um..my phone is buzzing" &lt;walks away unconvincingly&gt;
@lukedones What is wrong with these people?
@lukedones My understanding is that it lived on the second floor?
@lukedones Already responded to him. :)
@Roy_Astro Understood.  Just trying to give some context to the reactions that surprised you.
@Roy_Astro To the people who are steeping in it it's as obvious as the existence of gravity  and it's dismaying to hear it questioned.
@Roy_Astro There is plenty of evidence of systemic racism  from individual experience through to large-scale history and data.
@Roy_Astro Sure  I can absolutely see that is frustrating  though the comparison between those communities doesn't really hold.
@Roy_Astro I hope that makes some sense?
@Roy_Astro Hence the implicit/explicit admonition to "do your own research". Constantly explaining oneself is exhausting work.
@Roy_Astro That frustration is a real  well-founded emotion. It is good to want to learn more  but a burden to a small number of teachers.
@Roy_Astro It is also exhausting for people in the relevant communities to always be on call to answer these Qs  even for the well meaning.
@Roy_Astro If you feel like reading  the Washington Post has tried to gather stats: https://t.co/pr5zBveDrJ
@Roy_Astro Meanwhile  for political reasons  there has been no national database of deaths at the hands of the police.
@Roy_Astro There is a long history of police power being used to terrorize minority communities in addition to more legitimate functions.
@Roy_Astro @PlanetDr For starters: the climate and history in the UK  where I gather you're from  is different from the USA.
@PlanetDr Guess what?
@PlanetDr I didn't know you were Belgian. ⊗
@notfroggie @lukedones I agree with that  too.
@lukedones @notfroggie He can share an apartment with the guy deposed from Ukraine a couple of years ago. It'd be an Odd Couple reboot.
@notfroggie @lukedones Totally agree. The question is how many people he can get to agree with him.
@notfroggie @lukedones So if there's an unforecast difference like  say  higher minority turnout than expected  he'd claim fraud.
@notfroggie @lukedones He'd base that on any difference between polls and actual results. And as you note  polls can be hard.
@notfroggie @lukedones The interpretations of this I've seen are that Trump is setting the stage to claim the final vote is fraudulent.
@lukedones @eehouls Just like how Kerry demonstrated that his leading the Ohio exit polls incontrovertibly meant he took the state.
@K04PB2B @jtuttlekeane Phobos and Deimos formation (very recent theory)
@PlanetDr Ceres? :)
@brianwolven Yeah  that's what I saw. Does that include all the stuff like Tersiguels and the Pure Wine Cafe etc?
@brianwolven Oh  this sounds terrible. :( I've seen pictures of floods there from decades ago  never dreamed they'd recur.
@sondy @erinleeryan It was all the crowd could do not to just burst into tears  actually.
@astrotweeps Well  not just luck. :)
@lukedones I believe in math.
@PlanetDr In the best case this election will be cathartic. An argument can be made that in the worst case it will be a different catharsis.
@PlanetDr @nadiamdrake A stopped watch can always be right.
@tedstryk Ooh. I remember that well. I was working as a postdoc for one of the team members--what an up and down day....

@michael_w_busch @astropuckett @MinorPlanetCtr @astrotweeps Oh  right you are! Adonis was lost (and was in Tintin) but was later found.
@MinorPlanetCtr @michael_w_busch @astrotweeps And Adonis is the only named but not numbered asteroid  IIRC?  Plus it's in a Tintin book!
@michael_w_busch @MinorPlanetCtr @astrotweeps 719 Albert? Unless you're asking something different?
@rdrimmel That seems very likely  yeah. Castillo-Rogez has done recent work on depleting Ceres' ice via impacts.

@PlanetDr @TychoGirl @megschwamb How about instead of you apologizing  I thank you instead? :)
@MarsMaven @HopeJahren @lukedones The first 3 G&amp;Ts were excellent. I imagine the next 3 were as good  though I'm less certain.
@MarsMaven @HopeJahren @lukedones Remind me to bring you to the lesbian hipster NASA dive bar in Houston for Islay gin and artisanal tonics.
@HopeJahren @lukedones So  are _you_ familiar with Red Grape Malt Duck  then (as a Midwestern Gen-Xer)? (Attn @Valgren6)
@lukedones @HopeJahren I'm having flights of South American wine to prepare for #ACM2017 and to show my admiration for our sister republics.

@alexwitze Can't disagree.
@cosettegilmour But it seems like they'd have to have _some_ connection  otherwise quoting worth in $$ would be misleading?
@cosettegilmour Well  that's an interesting question  and you've hit my economics limit. :)

@jasonrdavis https://t.co/JlNgPpzYUS
@starstryder I see. :)  "non-simultaneous"?  That's not necessarily any better  though.  "non-immediate"?
@starstryder "archived"? Need you lump online forums and pre-recorded classes together?
@erinleeryan @PlanetDr  I think the (cynical) lesson from that is that when &lt;powerful special interest&gt; wants something  they find a way.
@PlanetDr I've been rereading my Sci Am blog post from December 2012  and it still holds up very well.  And that's really unfortunate.
@asmuniz @rocketrepreneur @jasonrdavis Actually  I already see I'm probably misreading your question.
@asmuniz @rocketrepreneur @jasonrdavis I'm probably not the right person to respond  but other US missions should be going in 2021.

@cathomas09 I've seen 3 (Michel/Delbo/Jacobson)  though I suppose I don't actually know how many people I know there or who's there now.
@OtherOrbScience I honestly have no idea what to think. I believe you're right  but just having this conversation is insane.
@OtherOrbScience Oh  sure. I mean  realistically that particular worst-case scenario is pretty remote in its specifics.
@OtherOrbScience OTOH  historically we tend to suffer more of the ethnic cleansing/genocide kind of fate than the chattel slavery one.
@OtherOrbScience All bets are off if he wins and the 13th and 14th Amendments get removed  though.  Who knows who I'd "belong" to.
@OtherOrbScience No.
@lukedones We have a veritable Traveling Wilburys kind of lineup in our session.

@PlutoBees @BadPhysics That'd be a reasonable working hypothesis  yeah. Someone would have to do the math  but maybe N2 or CO?
@BadPhysics Of course  we wouldn't care about H2O collecting in those but maybe other more volatile materials?
@BadPhysics I think all that's required is to be airless and relatively low obliquity. I bet Ganymede/Callisto have them as well. +
@verbiscer @Alex_Parker @NewHorizons2015 Does this break another #CakeEmbargo? 0:)

RT @SungrazerComets We're calling it  and you heard it here first: We believe some small part of #ISON's nucleus has SURVIVED perihelion.
RT @SungrazerComets Yes  *something* came out from behind the occulter... pretty certain there's no nucleus though...
RT @AmyMainzer It's important to withhold judgement right about now on ISON. Maybe a little bit made it  maybe not much - we'll see! &lt;--

@brendonbrewer  "Humans are natural-born Bayesians" remains a hypothesis that is both plausible (to me) and un-rejected (by this paper)

@astronomyblog @astroduff @fringetracker Hah! Herds of zebra do indeed travel in single file. Often with nebulous wildebeest in tow :-)
@astronomyblog Cygnus! It's the direction we are moving in  as we go round the galaxy  and so it's the direction that the DM wind comes from
@ickbat @brendonbrewer Hah! Busha and Wechsler were working on this then too (probably cited by Robotham). I joined in to invert the problem
@brendonbrewer All the focus here is on the HST frontier fields and their mocks  is that what you're working on?
.@brendonbrewer Coe just asked about the possibility of learning basis sets from simulations; one issue is the realism of sims #IPMUlens
@brendonbrewer Interesting: at the moment we are doing brute force/Laplace characterisation...
@Space_Mog Combined with CMB you can constrain dark energy parameters  like with BAO and SNe Ia and with similar precision (Suyu et al 2014)
@Space_Mog Time delay lenses give you an absolute measure of distance  which at redshift 0.5 or so means mostly H0  with some Om
@Space_Mog Cosmography is the mapping of the universe (like geography)  or more particularly  the measurement of cosmological parameters

@doug_burke @merrdiff @exoplaneteer I suspect for me the python3 tipping point will be the LSST DM stack release that first requires it...
@merrdiff @exoplaneteer @doug_burke I think we are all on the same page here :-) Bets for when we will be forced to adopt python3?
I'm still postponing moving to python3  but yes  this would be better:  print "{x:.2g} +/- {e:.1g}".format(x=1.3453 e=0.321) @merrdiff
@KnudJahnke They may not have accretion disks to start with  and be too lightweight to acquire one? Due time question can be asked of sims?

@mrtommyb Great  thanks Tom! @physicsdavid I hope you are following this. Let's estimate some Tsurface values  and see if we want to visit!
@exoplaneteer @mrtommyb No acronyms! I'd vote for naming that temperature the "warmth" - because I want comfort  not just habitability
@mrtommyb Nice! Teff and R are in Petigura's table  I suppose. What temperature does Earth have with this formula? Thanks! :-)
@mrtommyb @exoplaneteer T makes sense because red = hot  blue = cold  as well as temperature being of crucial interest to tourists!
@mrtommyb @exoplaneteer This is for an outreach activity BTW: I am trying to map some balls' colors to something interesting about planets
@mrtommyb @exoplaneteer Yeah - I guess T doesn't mean much if you don't know the atmosphere. Maybe  "sunniness" will have to do.
@ellieinspace What Quimby et al are suggesting is *minilensing*: high magnification at very small image separation @brendonbrewer
@EllieInSpace Microlensing magnifications can be just as high as those induced by galaxies  provided the source is small @brendonbrewer
@RTWbike Maybe just pick up a giant overcoat (and a revolver) before you set out? :-) @chrisenorth
The cross section for 30x magnification by a low mass galaxy is small - but PS1 sees a lot of galaxies @EllieInSpace @brendonbrewer
Oguri and I were focusing on multiple images you could resolve: Quimby et al consider low mass lenses too @EllieInSpace @brendonbrewer
The first strongly lensed supernova? http://t.co/fsR2nMsQHN describes a foreground galaxy in the SN spectrum! @EllieInSpace  @brendonbrewer
@megschwamb @briandnord @dotastronomy Ah! Got it. That was not easy to spot at first glance! Got it working in Safari but not Chrome. Thx!

Scargle asks: could Fraser et al not be seeing something *other* than axions? They say no  in section 4.3   @e_astronomer
Fraser et al detect an annual modulation of the high Earth orbit X-ray background  and suggest conversion of solar axions  @e_astronomer
Petrosian talked us through the figures from Fraser et al's XMM solar axions paper http://t.co/WEJ6fCmWCa @e_astronomer
Let @philipbull talk you through some of the vagaries of the #BICEP2 data: http://t.co/89Om8cfeXH
@brendonbrewer @astrosonnen Is it still a mixture model when one of only two components is highly constrained by physical assumptions?
@brendonbrewer @astrosonnen Suyu and I are in  making 4 willing Hobbits. Hopefully Gandalf will drop in on the fellowship from time to time
We could look at departure rates as a function of early sim/dud balance (which is random)  to see impact of negative feedback @megschwamb
Good question from @megschwamb at my Space Warps seminar today: do users leave after their first few images as a result of the feedback?
@brendonbrewer You might like Baes and Gentile's approach: just write them all as "Fox H functions" with various parameters :-)
.@mdschneider @realscientists So  air travel for science is important  and a good use of energy. I just like  knowing how much it costs!
.@mdschneider @realscientists Mitigation is also adaptation: improving our sense of environmental stewardship will make us more resilient.
.@mdschneider @realscientists I don't doubt the technology will come - but climate change mitigation is a race against time.
.@mdschneider @realscientists The trade is between air travel "for science " and being the change we need. It's hard to advocate w/o action!
@PenguinGalaxy @AstroKatie Also please note the revised distance in my previous tweets; Van Cleve was being a bit optimistic yesterday!
@PenguinGalaxy @AstroKatie Among other things. The paper I tweeted (from @cloud149) has a table of molecules and their detectability :-)
@AstroKatie @RickDNewton @KarenLMasters @jen_gupta @jegpeek @astroduff I agree with Tremaine too  but only up to a point.
.@megschwamb I think Twitter is especially important because it forces researchers to *get to the point* - so it's good training.
.@megschwamb I think tweeting is an important skill for researchers  whose work is in-depth by definition. Also webinars are so 2010! :-)
.@sarahkendrew @KarenLMasters @dalcantonJD @AstroKatie @astropixie @arielwaldman  @ebromleymdphd Thanks!
@brendonbrewer @mdschneider I have! Suyu et al 2010  2012  2013. That was  admittedly  a low-D problem.

@davidwhogg @brendonbrewer Yep  that's part of what I meant by "contrived." Also  making simplified mock data for which hyperpriors are easy

"I liked that you could take the log of a probability  call it information  and sound like you understood profound truths." - @brendonbrewer

@brendonbrewer I wonder how many citations it will receive?

@brendonbrewer Haha! You have adopted my approach to understanding probabilistic graphical models :-) @davidwhogg @chgreer @astrodrian
@astronomyblog @GeertMcTwit  Looks like a long and difficult conversation  Stuart. Good thing it happened *yesterday * eh? Keep smiling! :-)
@vrooje @jgeach @kevinschawinski @EricRWeinstein Well  it looks like a nice evening for it! :-)
@vrooje @jgeach @kevinschawinski Good for him! I like the sound of the cut of his gib.
@vrooje @jgeach @kevinschawinski Some elegance to start from  plus lots of opportunities for falsification? Sounds promising! :-)
@vrooje @jgeach @kevinschawinski What did the particle theorists make of it? What predictions does the theory make?
@astrofairy @anupreeta @a_kapadia @astronomyblog Thanks! Everyone loves gravitational lenses :-)
@dallascampbell Both those tweets might be rubbish. I seem to recall something else about vortices  but I never understood that part
@dallascampbell Bernouilli discovered this pressure difference while in the shower one day. He called it "the stupid curtain" effect
@dallascampbell A wing is shaped so the air rushes over it faster than under it  which lowers the air pressure on top and gives it "lift"
@shaka_lulu Cheers! :-)
@brendonbrewer @apontzen Aha - so you reserve the word "data" for the output of non-inferential procedures? (Or things assumed to be such)
My main point was that "data modeling" reminds me to test my assumptions about the telescope as well as the galaxy @apontzen @brendonbrewer
Having said that  we often do receive data in catalog form  ready to be compared with our generative model outputs @apontzen @brendonbrewer
There's something unsatisfactory about treating data as sacred constants. A good experimenter will report a PDF! @apontzen @brendonbrewer
@apontzen @brendonbrewer It's clearly about time I thought about this again! I learned the phrase from David MacKay: maybe time to move on?
@KirkDBorne But this implies twitter shouldn't be used as a filter. If my trusted voices can't be trusted  it's a noisy channel at best...

@e_astronomer was this max entropy equals no time? Then I've been there.
@StartsWithABang @elonmusk @lirarandall and I think your wrong to be so sure  and discussed in @AFortunateUni
@brendonbrewer @doctorkarl @garethdl83 @cosmicpinot Don’t think so.

@startswithabang @r_trotta Yep  the theories are special/general  not the relativity. Can lead to lead to confusion.

@StartsWithABang great stuff  but it's General theory of relativity  not theory of general relativity. The theory is general.

@piccolomud @mcnees @astrokatie The rocketeer in this paper was a she. https://t.co/x6LFkSns88
@bluebearsoup @fcain no  but the hardware is *not* the simulation. Whatever hardware our simulation is running on  it is not the universe.
@fcain ps - this is discussed in our upcoming book "A Fortunate Universe" @AFortunateUni
@bluebearsoup @fcain yes  it must. But it is not the universe (in the same way my cosmological simulations are not the computer they are on)
@bluebearsoup @fcain a simulation (in software) is not the same as hardware.
@bluebearsoup @fcain "is the universe a computer?" Is not the same question as "is the universe a simulation?"

David Rielly joins the stage to talk about building quantum systems @Sydney_Science https://t.co/TjWEnKqgqM
There are atoms dancing on stage!! Under @MJBiercuk's control @Sydney_Science https://t.co/n4cYkZSPP3
There's a revolution coming  @MJBiercuk tells us  a quantum revolution!! @Sydney_Science https://t.co/3n2tx4Fnqa
@science_academy Or this one https://t.co/u1iqObhjtq
@science_academy And we are not on this list https://t.co/DjiUkONglR
@tokteacher @breakfastnews @del_irani Again - I disagree. The actual placing is not a good indicator  but relative to the top is.
@tokteacher @breakfastnews @del_irani The point is we are supposed to be becoming an innovation nation. It does not appear to be happening.
@tokteacher @breakfastnews @del_irani I disagree that it is ‘meaningless’. It does reflect the true level of innovation in this country.
@colinpayn @whoordie @progrockers Dr Phibes 1 and 2 are up there for me!
@colinpayn @whoordie @progrockers I second Peter Cushing for Silver. Love them all  but Peter slightly pips Vincent!
@fcain @storybywill @peterdedmonds or “Science acts as it should”?
@reasther @michelle_lmc Just wondering if they were a real person? They are really tiresome…
@startswithabang Your readers might like “On The Relativity of Redshifts: Does Space Really "Expand"?” https://t.co/1NYLIgWPCn
@astrotweeps I know that map!
@sourcecommsaus @jackie_randles @profbriancox @maasmuseum @sydsciencefest @sydney_science There is no “bottom” or top or sides or centre.
@L0Jim maybe - but are nations obsessing about medal tallies the way to achieve that?
@bencubby Right behind verbing the noun!
@l0jim Are athlete’s healthier?  https://t.co/TDoVpSiRyF Do we need a multi-million dollar AIS to have athletics in society?
@drarnakarick Same issue as always - more money would solve a lot of things. But can’t see it happening.
@drarnakarick @astromatto @sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot Have actually had these kind of discussions - always limited funds
@drarnakarick @astromatto @sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot That would mean reducing the number of permanent staff.
@brendonbrewer and who decides that?
@brendonbrewer That would help solve the problem.
@brendonbrewer The ones who would take it if voluntary would be the ones you would not want to leave (&amp; vice versa)
@cosmicpinot @brendonbrewer I didn’t say they had to stop researching  supervision etc. Just support themselves differently. Frees up lines
@brendonbrewer Lack of positions due to doddery old unproductive professors staying rather than going  is an issue.
@brendonbrewer You would get 5 years salary severance pay.
@brendonbrewer @sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick Why?
@sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick https://t.co/c81lQF6uOZ
@cosmicpinot @sarahkendrew @drarnakarick I agree! But people must understand this when coming in door  not only while going out.
@sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick Or force retirement from academic positions (at 50?)
@sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick But will there ever be enough permanent positions for postdocs?
@drarnakarick @cosmicpinot I don’t think politicians care that much about the scientific funding cycle.
@drarnakarick @cosmicpinot Postdocs are effectively set by grant funding - would love to lock in 3+ years  but funding cycle doesn’t work.
@popsci Jet glider? Huh?
@brendonbrewer Sounds (and looks) wonderful :)
@brendonbrewer Progress!! and it’s only taken a decade!! :)
@brendonbrewer Excellent! (Does it still load only text files?)
@StartsWithABang @bstorax @rmathematicus no  there via not a scientific method other than wish you-washy idealism.
@bluebearsoup @tokteacher @brendonbrewer @tegmark Test of mathematics  yes  interpretation  no.
@bluebearsoup @tokteacher @brendonbrewer @tegmark Extravagant or not  nothing makes it more than an interpretation.
@bluebearsoup @tokteacher @brendonbrewer @tegmark So?
@tokteacher @brendonbrewer @bluebearsoup Yes  I understand you are wedded to the idea  but many are not. It feels right to you.
@bencubby @domaincomau I see we have suburb snobbery going on!
@startswithabang Most straight forward interpretation of a critical universe is infinitely large (although GR is geometric  not topological)
@StartsWithABang if the universe is infinitely large today  it was at the Big Bang  so there would be an infinite number of points at birth
@spiritualgenome @LIGO @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @RupertSheldrake just different way of looking at the same things.
@spiritualgenome @LIGO @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @RupertSheldrake Fourier transforms don't change things from a to b.
@spiritualgenome @LIGO @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @RupertSheldrake nope.
@spiritualgenome @ligo @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @rupertsheldrake Whatever.
@spiritualgenome @ligo @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @rupertsheldrake [Actually following null paths in 4-D means their speed is zero]
@spiritualgenome @ligo @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @rupertsheldrake Not assumption - mathematics.
@spiritualgenome @ligo @skyponderer @josh_sokol @nobelprize Not at all. Just simple mathematics.
@spiritualgenome @LIGO @skyponderer @josh_sokol @NobelPrize what does convenience have to do with anything?
@startswithabang Sorry  British reserve kicking in!
@StartsWithABang we only get predictive science in 3 space &amp; 1 time  &amp; why our universe ended up like this is a bit of a mystery!
@marcuschown @brainpicker More strictly speaking  the discovery of dark matter is a messy topic (from page 113 in https://t.co/0qOjoqEoUu)
@broadly @bencubby I believe in aliens (but not that they have visited here). Does that make me a celebrity?
@michelle_lmc It’s all just noise these days!

@strom_m @mikeyslezak Science “communication” relies on words  pictures &amp; handwaving. Science communication is story telling  not science.

@delfindelfinis @merrickphillip @doctorkarl @astropixie @cosmicpinot Nope - no clearer…
@delfindelfinis @merrickphillip @doctorkarl @astropixie @cosmicpinot What does that *mean*?
@merrickphillip @doctorkarl @astropixie @cosmicpinot @delfindelfinis But nobody knows how mass from the Higgs field causes gravity. Mystery!
@MerrickPhillip @DoctorKarl @astropixie @cosmicpinot @delfindelfinis what does that mean?
@L0Jim no  they don't  but some suggest it could be an influence from another universe.
@strom_m MMMMMMMMM Bop…
@arfisk @doctorkarl You can’t - Heisenberg won’t allow it.
@spiritualgenome @LIGO @josh_sokol @NobelPrize @newscientist @neiltyson are they? Can you demonstrate that?
@naturenews Only if you have a desperately narrow definition of what peer review is.
@brendonbrewer &amp; I should clarify that economics turned out to be more interesting than I imagined!
@brendonbrewer Ditto - part of the problem was that economics was not what I thought it was!
@brendonbrewer I’ve been learning physics for more than 30 years &amp; have only scratched the surface.
@adambspencer @Sydney_Uni @Sydney_Science what's a "lunch room"?
@merrickphillip Poor use of if statements (common in astro) conflicting with branch predictors - leads to poor efficiency!
@merrickphillip Alas  given modern hardware  that’s not always the case.
@merrickphillip Problem is that most project don’t think about long term code use - normally quick and dirty coding.
@mjibrown … and don’t get me started on the Earth orbiting the Sun…
@mjibrown Flat earth  as in entire Earth  is clearly nonsense. But treating my little patch as flat is perfectly acceptable….
@mjibrown Yeah  but I get cross with “holier than thou”s laughing at others with regards to their scientific understanding.
@MJIBrown and anyone who claims to hold the truth (including scientists) is heading for a fall.
@MJIBrown but extrapolating a model beyond its workable regime is always a problem.
@MJIBrown flat earth is a perfectly acceptable model for most human activities. Don't need to worry about curved Earth to build a house.
@astrotweeps I’ll walk with you! Astronomy is my job  not my hobby.
@fcain @storybywill that's nothing! I'm going 3% the speed of light relative to something over there (points).
@michelle_lmc @AstroKatie you're not the first person I've heard say that!
@StartsWithABang @NASAWatch @AdamFrank4 @nytimes [we're on the same side! Sorry  Twitter not good at catching tone]
@StartsWithABang @NASAWatch @AdamFrank4 @nytimes that  sir  is the ENTIRE point. The answer is not a or b  but "between 0 and lots"
@DoctorKarl @Cathy_Crawley @danking0903 @alexwitze @ISS_Research GRRRRR! I hate this kind of comment
@NASAWatch @StartsWithABang @AdamFrank4 @nytimes perhaps we should do probablistic calculations properly &amp; this slap fest can end?
@StartsWithABang @AdamFrank4 @nytimes ... The Drake equation is still used in this fashion.
@StartsWithABang @AdamFrank4 @nytimes ... In an outcome  when the answer is plausibly somewhere between zero and a lot. Depressing that ...
@StartsWithABang @AdamFrank4 @nytimes simply a failure of maths  using numbers not distributions for quantities. Results in certainty ...
@physorg_com "release a study" means "published a paper"?????
@michelle_lmc While I would love to  this really is a lightening visit. Hope to be back later in year - would love to then :)
@abcnewsbrisbane @abcnews Well done! I wish I could join him in donating  but being a brit  I am barred.
@_kaelon_ Books by @marcuschown  @seanmcarroll  @bgreene have lots of very interesting cosmological stuff. And there is @AFortunateUni !
@robertcnichol Born in Neath  raised in Seven Sisters and Crynant (Dulais Valley) - Welsh list sounds good!
@MJIBrown @AstroKatie additionally with funding deadlines.
@cloud149 @brendonbrewer @davidwhogg is (are?) statistics science?
@michelle_lmc Which really only adds to the mystery!
@PopSci yes - next.
@mjbiercuk @realscientists And let’s see if it will be..
@mjbiercuk @realscientists Again  I agree - but *everyone* is arguing the same case - critical thinking  problem solving etc.
@mjbiercuk @realscientists SKA was then - this is now. Astro does not fit into any ARC strategic directions.
@realscientists @mjbiercuk I agree - but saying we simply deserve more than the arts is not going to cut it.
@mjbiercuk @realscientists I know!! But  as you know  basic research is left out of strategic alignment of governments etc.
@mjbiercuk @realscientists I think this can be a dangerous and slippery argument. No minister I’ve spoken to likes “basic” science.
@mjbiercuk @realscientists I agree  but some people equate useful with applications. Black holes are as useful as poetry.
@mjbiercuk @realscientists So - no science for science sake? No work on black holes or searching for dark matter  Higgs etc?
@brendonbrewer @fcain @evangough2 Yeah - that’s exactly what sprung into my mind!
@cosmos4u @astroduff I didn’t say it wasn’t. I said the explanations are speculative.
@Tim_JR_Hill @marcuschown @MikeTonge that is incorrect. If it was  we would never have measured gravitational waves
@brendonbrewer Or are you just getting used to them?
@brendonbrewer Sorry - fixed!
@skdh @StartsWithABang missing satellites  too big to fail  planes of dwarfs...
@StartsWithABang @skdh you left out small-scale cosmological structure
@brendonbrewer I know which paper that is!!!!
@strom_m @CroweDM two black holes that close would of have a single event horizon. No simple way to separate as very nonlinear.
@ockhamsbeard @MJIBrown @ConversationEDU NBN is not even on my safe liberal seat horizon - &amp; I live in Sydney
@el_lobo_rayado @astrokatie @aaoastro Ditto for giving a colloquium at USyd School of Physics!
@strom_m yay! Well done
@sciencenews It’s still not moving in that direction…
@kickstarter @popsci @popsci or not.
@sciencenews Not sure who prepared the graphics  but that is simply not the way the star is moving. In fact  story is almost opposite…
@_sarahmartell_ yes  they are expensive  aren't they!

@Dunlap_Obs @SciBry did he really?
@NatureNews nonsense?
@MJIBrown @MonashUni what's a logie?
@sharanjit @doctorkarl @astropixie Nope - but it is the correct definition of a dot product :)
@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ yeah - academia is rarely the life you dreamt about as a student!
@_sarahmartell_ @bradpholden ditto - but we should not have been so naive to the options.
@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ imhe much of the thought of academic careers comes from not considering options.
@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ i don't train mine to be academics and encourage constant thinking of career options.
@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ here we have to have justified ranked lists for all positions.
@drsimmo @bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ i agree - metrics are useful.
@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ training grad students is fine unless you think sole purpose is to produce more academics.
@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ usually it's a committee discussion so a captain's pick doesn't normally work. Need to produce ranked list.
@_sarahmartell_ @bradpholden usual question - how do you judge the "worth" of an academic? How would you rank a pool?
@StartsWithABang @Forbes .. whether you out run photons in curved space-time.
@StartsWithABang @Forbes in a "propagation of disturbance in space-time" kind of a way. Speed of light is a local thing &amp; doesn't dictate ..
@forbes @startswithabang Similarly  disturbances can travel slower than c.
@forbes @startswithabang … a local quantity and disturbances can outrun photons (i.e. alcubierre metric).
@forbes @startswithabang .. it is the characteristic speed of perturbations of a weak-field metric  but for general metrics  c is just …
@forbes Not wanting to argue too much with @StartsWithABang but the answer is not quite correct. Gravitational waves travel at c as …
@brendonbrewer You should have pushed your paper through.. https://t.co/hFO5DOMSWh
@brendonbrewer Probably?
@adamparsons1 @ruthie147 @howstuffworks [Well  to be strictly accurate  all mass in the universe has an influence on tides  including stars]
@adamparsons1 @ruthie147 @howstuffworks Correct  moon dominates the tides on Earth.
@brendonbrewer [For the physicists  note that mass and atomic are not what you think they are]
@michelle_lmc @nfmartin1980 and happy birthday from me too!

@michelle_lmc @almaobs Well - where that dot is  there is basically 3/5ths of not very much at all. I am surprised there is astronomy there!
@almaobs @michelle_lmc Where is that dot in central Australia?
@peterdedmonds @brainpicker [with Ken Freeman?]
@marcuschown The best thing is seeing the smoke  then feeling the concussion a fraction of a second later!
@peterdedmonds Is there a lot of evidence that people on most influential lists go on to influence things?
@Forbes @StartsWithABang surely 99.8% sure is statistical fallacy 101!
@david_hurn @bluebearsoup @tokteacher Actually  tomorrow  is slightly less true.
@david_hurn @bluebearsoup @tokteacher There are huge numbers of possible dinosaurs  only a subset were realised.

@ickbat Have you spoken to @brendonbrewer ?
@peterdedmonds Black Holes are simple compared to neutron stars (or bees for that matter)
@michelle_lmc Teaching load - words that strike fear into the heart of an academic.
@piccolomud @brendonbrewer @davidwhogg And when I do my Thunderstruck out the door  I am going to scream abuse at being “professional”.
@piccolomud @brendonbrewer @davidwhogg No - they write like what they read. Referees demand. We are becoming more and more crap at writing.
@riaus Guess you’ve never been in a chemistry lab…
@brendonbrewer @davidwhogg And when you do you often think “what minimal fluff wrapped up in pomposity”…
@brendonbrewer @davidwhogg … decoding what people have done is testament to the fact we are in a hole.
@brendonbrewer @davidwhogg I don’t think so - I think that’s what science papers are supposed to be. The fact we spend so much time …
@brendonbrewer @davidwhogg @aucklanduni I wish we could wipe the slate clean with academic writing and start again…
@weezmgk @michaelapage5 @doctorkarl @astropixie Whatever.
@darrencroton @kevinschawinski it's the message that's important  not the font. I use comic sans to send the font sobs into a frenzy.
@MJIBrown IRAF? How quaint!
@peterdedmonds @spacedotcom I am definitely not in that boat. “Hawking says…” is an immediate turn off to a story for me.
@PeterDEdmonds @SPACEdotcom why does anyone care what Hawking has to say on this or most matters?
@strom_m @CBSNews exactly - what would happen to a Russian ship sailing of the coast of US?
@brendonbrewer welcome to the wonderful world of knowing what's going on. It's not that difficult
@sarahkendrew @KarinaVoggel @michelle_lmc we don't have a university police force  and am happy about that.
@michelle_lmc @stellarplanet I know :) &amp; think it’s great! but have had trouble explaining to public what “see” means!
@michelle_lmc @stellarplanet see? Hmmm
@MJIBrown groan...
@_sarahmartell_ tap  tap  tap….
@merrickphillip They are  but it’s a little bit more complicated as the universe is expanding.
@merrickphillip Speed of light being the speed of light is a *local* thing (i..e. in your laboratory). Speed “over there” can be different
@merrickphillip @doctorkarl @cosmicpinot @astropixie Yep  many who know better use the “inflation was faster than light” line!
@merrickphillip @doctorkarl @cosmicpinot @astropixie This is proportional to how far they are apart. Far enough now has separations &gt;c
@merrickphillip @doctorkarl @cosmicpinot @astropixie The important thing is the rate at which the distance between two objects is increasing
@merrickphillip @doctorkarl @cosmicpinot @astropixie Start with @tamarastro’s https://t.co/uBIz4qQ6dg

@dudedarkmatter @peterdedmonds [I was too  and remember everyone going - oh OK - a bit like when we knew what Ho was]
@science_academy Would you write about a female mathematician like this?
@monsoon0 @sydney_uni @science_academy What do late bloomers who took a while to get used to school and are now in general maths do?
@DudeDarkmatter @JossBlandHawtho @PeterDEdmonds i personally hate fake historical textbook science. Should be thrown away.
@DudeDarkmatter @JossBlandHawtho @dalcantonJD @PeterDEdmonds further illustrates that real science is not the science of the textbook.

@nfmartin1980 @8minutesold @michelle_lmc i think it might be!
@8minutesold @michelle_lmc @nfmartin1980 is it what I think it is?
@brendonbrewer Your definition of belief (based on evidence) and the accepted version (I just feel this way) are somewhat different.
@fossilcrox @riaus @scienceau @riaus So many conversations begin with “I don’t know anything about science…”
@fossilcrox @riaus @scienceau @riaus What training do the media do before talking to scientists?
@rowhoop @doctorkarl @abcnews24 Looks like you are on next week - will send a screenshot then :)

@brendonbrewer @alxetz That’s a nicely coloured straw your grasping at!! :)
@alxetz @brendonbrewer Where is statistics when I calculate how a photon travels through space?
@alxetz @brendonbrewer I agree  but not sure what the correspondence is supposed to mean.
@alxetz @brendonbrewer What does that mean?
@mjibrown @ad_mico I did mis-number my pages once. Not allowed to scribble them out.. Reprint incorrect pages and re-scribble…
@mjibrown Did mine today  silently screaming at myself “Of course this is the current proposal  what else is it likely to be..”
@brendonbrewer @nzherald Based on some survey with some random criteria…
@andrewwetzel @michelle_lmc That’s fine - but let’s see what happens to predictions that are yet to be tested.
@michelle_lmc @andrewwetzel Didn’t want to bring that up - people will think it’s all I bang on about :)
@michelle_lmc @andrewwetzel .. solved. We need to take the predictions of this and test it further and see if we can rule out alternatives.
@michelle_lmc @andrewwetzel I just mean this is a post-diction - so we have an answer we are happy with  but that doesn’t mean problem is ..
@michelle_lmc @andrewwetzel But is this a case of finding the answer when you know what the answer actually is?
@mjibrown @arc_gov_au If only there was an online depository.. Oh  we’ve had this conversation (every year!)
@mjibrown @ad_mico If only there was a possible way to achieve this seemingly unobtainable technological breakthrough!
@newusadream @rcoontz More than 1000 authors? Won’t count in research assessment then!
@DrBenjaminHabib @BreakfastNews I'm terrified every single time. I completely understand and wish you the best.
@astrokatie @abcnews24 There’s a run of astronomers in the media! Am in @smh  have been on radio in NZ and am on @abc radio in the morning.
@mjibrown I can attend without being a member - just need to know about them.

@mjibrown Didn’t know that #ANITA2016 was on  as they didn’t let non-ASA members know. Ah well.
@brendonbrewer @jossblandhawtho I will!
@brendonbrewer So it does depend upon what their opinion is. Hence some may wish to remain masked.
@brendonbrewer Irrespective of opinion?

@StartsWithABang @Forbes of course  but I love being picky :)
@StartsWithABang @Forbes but being picky  the blobs in CMB are stars and galaxies today.
@StartsWithABang @Forbes it's only a little closer
@forbes @StartsWithABang Ain’t the particle horizon (and essentially the CMB) ~46 billion light years?
@astroduff @brendonbrewer @flintoff11 @theprojectv Ah! He’s a Bayesian then. Excellent.
@brendonbrewer @astroduff @flintoff11 @theprojectv What was the basis of his skepticism? In-depth examination of the evidence?
@brendonbrewer you learnt well  young padawan
@exploreplanets @science_academy Surely it’s observational evidence of a theoretical planet? There is no such thing as theoretical evidence.

@brendonbrewer Laughing Gnome.
@mtmurphy77 @mjibrown @mattkenworthy I just don’t bother. Not worth the effort…
@mjibrown No - New one on me!
@mjibrown It's all a conspiracy to make us give up and not apply..
@mjibrown What's the point of having an orcid id if I can't simply enter that and it uploads my papers in the correct format.
@mjibrown And the bit where I have to format my publication list and star this  and wangle that..
@brendonbrewer @JohnDCook absolutely!
@ProfBrianCox @jodrellbank @BBCStargazing that is a radio telescope  so clouds don't matter.
@marcuschown I think I might know who you are talking about.
@mjibrown I forgot to add “per day”!
@mjibrown I got that one too…
@darth_ben @nhuntwalker @dudedarkmatter @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport What's old is new again!
@dudedarkmatter @darth_ben @nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport I agree  but the tools help  not hinder…
@nhuntwalker @dudedarkmatter @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Correct  but then astronomy shuffles forward  reinventing &amp; shuffling
@dudedarkmatter @nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Shameless reposting https://t.co/E2ikRlWVCW
@dudedarkmatter @nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Maths  speaking  strategic thinking are all tools. They help.
@nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Yep. Programming should be as integral to physics as  well  integrals (&amp; other maths)
@nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Correct! and to be convinced it is important (like stats  writing  speaking etc)
@nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Yep  like most astronomers. Yet it is key to many astro careers.
@nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Writing clumsy code leads to inefficiencies &amp; constant reinvention of wheel
@nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport And that’s where the problem starts! I advocate proper programming as key astro skill
@dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport @nhuntwalker Most astronomers actually suck at programming rather than algorithms. Most such bad..
@kipstewart @doctorkarl @phoboshighway Proportional to M  and that is larger in a longer cylinder.
@MJIBrown funny thing is that Australia is really so homogeneous compared to European counties  or even the US. Everywhere is the same.
@brendonbrewer Could mean that it is a bit more “bespoke” than mass produced  off-the-plan kind of places.
@brendonbrewer More likely this? https://t.co/hf6q92L0NM
@brendonbrewer A fletcher is someone who puts the feathers on arrows  so it should be obvious!
@popsci The answer is yes no matter how much history is to be revised (&amp; the picture is an american launch post war).
@mjibrown Fair enough…
@mjibrown Hmmm.. Didn't think the comment was that bad.
@DRG_physics please feel free to call back when it's online again :)
@drg_physics Nope. In physical distance  it asymptotes to a fixed value.
@asrivkin @badphysics @astrokatie Sunday trivia - the surface density of the disk of the MW is about a couple of sheets of paper. That’s all
@JossBlandHawtho @StartsWithABang anyone who makes a global proclamation is not doing science.
@StartsWithABang accurate theories promoted  less accurate demoted
@StartsWithABang yep  and talk of religation rather than falsification
@StartsWithABang I think I disagree with you a little. “Falsification” is an arbitrary standard in science  which leads to trouble.
@astrokatie @reasther @startswithabang [Doesn't help that science means different things to different people!]
@reasther @startswithabang Interiors of black holes are testable. Find one and jump in.
@quasidog74 @DoctorKarl @Edshouston @AtyHans @voiceofapollo in general  yes  but mathematics of cosmology only has space expanding.
@Edshouston @AtyHans @DoctorKarl @voiceofapollo for everyone at "rest" wrt to BB  but the same time has passed.
@ProfMSmall @Edshouston @AtyHans @DoctorKarl @voiceofapollo no - in the mathematics of cosmology  only space expands ( in FRW metric)
@edshouston @atyhans @doctorkarl @voiceofapollo Time does not expand. Only space.
@phil_baty @global_bu @michelle_lmc No data for the US  Canada and Australia? Huh?
@astroduff @breakfastnews As I was observing for @galahsurvey last night  I was asleep when you were on :)
@mjibrown PiP may win! https://t.co/Opii16WXCH
@MJIBrown @RetractionWatch not sure - does joc tells us theirs?
@MJIBrown @RetractionWatch have u chkd out received and accepted dates in progress in physics?
@rock_muppet @doctorkarl The presence of the moon has stabilised the rotation of the Earth.
@rock_muppet @doctorkarl It provides a breaking on the Earth's rotation.  I love non-spherical gravitational pulls.
@galahsurvey @_sarahmartell_ Gremlins chased away! We are collecting photons from stars!
@_sarahmartell_  Oh yeah - it's shaping up to be a real "classic" night!!
@_sarahmartell_ Red screen  klaxons  and now a bit of spanner wielding!
First night of three observing for @galahsurvey at @AAOastro  - &amp; unfortunately the gremlins are out in abundance!!
@fringetracker @brendonbrewer You can't win them all!
@mjibrown One person's opinion which continues the downward spiral of scientific writing.
@mjibrown It is precisely this snobbery that has turned scientific writing into the turgid mess it finds itself in. Dull &amp; zombie-like.
@mjibrown Precisely - it's what is said that's important  not how it is said. Font snobs are as useless as music  book  food  wine etc snobs
@mjibrown I use comic sans in talks.
@brendonbrewer It would benefit from the addition of a Union Jack.
@naturenews A quantum information researcher named Cubitt? Surely not!!! (Well  being quantum  as sure as we can be :)
@mjibrown Oh to be paid something for my writing…
The Great Statistical Schism by @brendonbrewer - I recommend a read - https://t.co/GngvZ9Srib
@brendonbrewer @karlglazebrook No - but we did account for it!! :)
@karlglazebrook ps @brendonbrewer insight that the night sky is dark is extremely insightful and extremely powerful!
@thebrolster @brendonbrewer wait til you've got kids!
@mjibrown @abcnews What really annoys me is that the teacher dreaded teaching science &amp; so "creative"ed it. Didn't understand science!
GRRRR!!! Now @abcnews is equating "Creativity" as "Not Science". For flips sake!
@astrotweeps @DrMaggieHardy @realscientists the opposite of science is not creative- I am tired of explaining this to "creative types"
@mjibrown @conversationedu Thx!  I was singing when I wrote it :)
@brendonbrewer I just remember compiler dependent issues on how functions were referred. It was painful  but fun to do. Maybe it is easier
@brendonbrewer I used to do that - I had to write a c interface between the two. Those were the days!
@mjibrown @conversationedu Wouldn't be the tired old stereotypical view of a scientists now  would it?
@mjibrown @conversationedu @rawstory Why is the Einstein character at the top of the article wearing a lab coat and holding a test tube?
@pythonomer @timesofindia there were a lot of people "on the street" of NY on 9/11
@brendonbrewer @DataSciFact stats  maybe  but grammar!!!!
@brendonbrewer @BridieSmith this is about block funding  not grant funding.
@pythonomer @brendonbrewer We should stop teaching classical statistical tests first -as it gets ingrained as "correct" and is hard to shift
@brendonbrewer I dream about them. And when I say dream  I don't mean in a good way!
@astroduff @breakfastnews I think it is going to be fun! Some decent auroras over Sydney would be nice!
@astroduff @breakfastnews Did you know that the Earth's magnetic north pole is not on the opposite side of the planet to its south pole?
@astroduff @AusAndgie7 @AstroKatie @ABCNews24 you do realize it cost more than 150 billion - that's more than Apollo.
@astroduff @AusAndgie7 @AstroKatie @ABCNews24 nope. It was a diversion of funding from other (imho) more important space exploration.
@ausandgie7 @astrokatie @abcnews24 https://t.co/QgIAZ4RmBC
@ausandgie7 @astrokatie @abcnews24 Not just me it seems https://t.co/MemUKi00ZK https://t.co/d21mJQcBMq https://t.co/MmTi6Qhl5u
@ausandgie7 @astrokatie @abcnews24 *Shrug* never said there were no outcomes  just that ISS has been a diversion from other activities.
@AstroKatie @AusAndgie7 @ABCNews24 Alas  I see ISS as little more than a white elephant that has diverted funding from other areas.
@brendonbrewer yep - like those too!
@brendonbrewer Which ever you like  and ignore the colormap zealots…
@katieoh9 @astrotweeps down
@astrotweeps basic map reading teaches you the difference between magnetic and true north.
@itsmichellefish @abcnews @774melbourne And those of us not interested in a horse race.
@michelle_lmc Embrace those youthful looks. No one ever asks me if I am a new student  no matter how hard I try!
@mjibrown @arc_gov_au I do! As you know  I think all academics should be made redundant at 50!
@mjibrown @arc_gov_au That was noted by several I chatted with.
@mjibrown @arc_gov_au As were several unsuccessful ones!
@brendonbrewer @ad_mico [? haz?]
@jegpeek @astroduff @arc_gov_au good luck everyone!
@brendonbrewer @LianneZimm buy in somewhere and use CG to upgrade in a few years.
@brendonbrewer @LianneZimm are you looking to buy for life? Clearly capital gain is your friend in Auckland.
@_sarahmartell_ There is no practical limit to rsync  only impractical!
@hcaflinders @drspacejunk I think we'll be at the same event this evening!!
@ad_mico @SmithsonianMag not bored  but continually dismayed at the lone genius myth
@strom_m https://t.co/TiLFfrpgdT  https://t.co/nuGva0ObuT https://t.co/NE3ho6Ku0r  etc
@strom_m That's precisely what "risk" means. And it is relative risk that should be reported  not hysterical "IT WILL KILL YOU"
@strom_m GRRR!! I didn't say it didn't! I said the important issue is "risk"  not is it a carcinogen!
@strom_m @theatlantic That's what I said :)
@strom_m And frightening the bejesus out of people without explaining this is a terrible approach.
@strom_m carcinogenic does not mean "guaranteed to give you cancer".
@strom_m I never said it wasn't. What I said was that everything comes with a relative risk. This is the important thing to understand.
@strom_m And less than the estimated rate from air pollution - 1483 (https://t.co/GGmciZCrlH)
@strom_m Significantly less than the suicide rate 2461 https://t.co/tzIIsVWDXP
@strom_m Less than number of deaths on the road - 1200 (https://t.co/7zInf4FQSs)
@strom_m Number of bowel cancer in Australia = 17070 (https://t.co/BPa3Ci2fFa) 18% increase is 3072. Survival 67%  so 1024 deaths per yr.
@strom_m I haven't! What is important is what is the actual relative risk. People are hopeless at assessing this.
@strom_m And you come to that conclusion based on ?
@strom_m Of course. Smoking comes with risks. You are not guaranteed to get cancer if you smoke but the chances are higher than if you don't
@strom_m Is eating bacon more dangerous than breathing in the pollution in Sydney?
@strom_m I meant the world is not full of "good things" that don't cause cancer  and "bad things" that do.
@strom_m Is eating bacon everyday more or less risky than running across the M5? What about compared to rock fishing? Everything has risks.
@strom_m But cancer is not binary. There are  relative risks associated with everything  and we are poor at understanding these.
@stargazerfred @abcnews I weep gently to myself when I see a story about quantum mechanics claim it is "spooky".
@mjibrown @cosmicpinot @scibry I still stand my http://t.co/c81lQF6uOZ - happy to move the kick out age to 50.
@MJIBrown @sortius not that those papers are remotely original.
@markapple @aaoastro I believe it will be recorded - will publish details when I have them.
@dudedarkmatter @grumpykelson @jbprime Even that is uncertain  especially if you're just a brain in a jar (of beer?)
@GrumpyKelson @jbprime @DudeDarkmatter time is what clocks measure (with an uncertainty)
@GrumpyKelson @jbprime @DudeDarkmatter all information arriving in your mind comes with an uncertainty.  Some uncertainties are very small
@jbprime @grumpykelson @dudedarkmatter Loads of people use the geocentric model everyday when working out what time it is. Still useful
@grumpykelson @jbprime @dudedarkmatter A level of subjectivity comes in to it - what is "reasonable doubt" for evidence. This is subjective.
@grumpykelson @jbprime @dudedarkmatter "Fact" are not absolute  but come with uncertainties  and so nothing can be absolutely ruled out.
@RiAus not leap into the air when instructed?
Sky above @AAOastro with the Milky Way  LMC and SMC. http://t.co/MDxPoWk8cO
@mjibrown @smh Yep - lots of comment and thought from @astrokatie
@strom_m An absolute classic!!!!!
Looks like Pluto from New Horizons  but alas it's just the sky above the AAT @AAOastro http://t.co/gX64CEFaJi
@brendonbrewer @stuartjritchie Thanks - also found this http://t.co/YInh9goZZb
@brendonbrewer @earl_leonard Plausible  yes  but does it happen. My gut feeling (from whom I meet) that the correlation is weak.
@brendonbrewer @nzstuff SNAP!!
@alex_parker @mjibrown I too was sitting there wondering if he would make it to the end! (although he didn't die in Ronin IIRC)
@skdh @physorg_com I just try to balance my portfolio  with some more left-field coupled with more mainstream. #strategyisnotadirtyword
@brendonbrewer I have a fear of them breaking in and taking my house apart!
@mjibrown @briscoejames I agree! But I have an idea for the perfect physics textbook!
@sydney_science One of the brightest quasars in the Universe and a strange plane of dwarf galaxies in Andromeda.
@mjibrown @briscoejames Absolutely!!! I very much agree. Perhaps you and I should go into the textbook industry?
@vacant3rdman @jossblandhawtho FFS! Another one!! http://t.co/BQkXHyBxo7
@vacant3rdman @jossblandhawtho Yes  I must have received 7 or 8 of them by now.
@nfmartin1980 @michelle_lmc wonderful! I will soon become a Ph.D. grandfather - and it has been the best part of being an academic :)
@michelle_lmc Backed the wrong horse there! :)
@astrokatie @mjibrown Posted mine to twitter this morning.
@spacecom @badastronomer Have you not been reading the newspapers? http://t.co/8k72wMukIj
@bencubby @MJIBrown more moist than wet!
@jayalver @trampolinrocket Yes  but I have already heard comparisons to rivers etc  which are incorrect.
@polyman71 @trampolinrocket Listed as a possible but followed by "it is unclear whether Martian atmosphere can supply sufficient water.."
@polyman71 @trampolinrocket It's a possible but direct from paper "The origin of water forming the RSL is not understood" followed by maybes
@polyman71 @trampolinrocket Actually  it doesn't (having read the paper) - ambivalent on source of water.
@jayalver @trampolinrocket Flow gives the image of the Amazon. Dribble is damp dirt on a slope  which is closer to the truth.
@brendonbrewer it is such a mismatch to the ideal of science sold publicly.
@brendonbrewer how can this be? Science is nothing but data &amp; statistics! Or are you suggesting that people  &amp; their priors  are involved?
@astroduff @breakfastnews If the LIGO rumours are remotely true  we are going to find ourselves in an interesting situation.
@brendonbrewer Correct. Need to get on the short-list &amp; should make the readers job easy to make this judgement.
@REasther @brendonbrewer and people who make it difficult to assess if they are top performers are dooming themselves. Make it simple.
@REasther @brendonbrewer yes  and things like h-index  total cites etc are a starting point. Need to get on short list of top performers.
@REasther @brendonbrewer how do you rank n people for such an appointment?
@REasther @brendonbrewer yes  but h-index is a starting point  not answer.
@REasther @brendonbrewer my worry is academics would prefer to be assessed through magic and feelings rather than anything tangible.
@REasther @brendonbrewer overdo is bad  but pretending it's not there is madness.
@REasther @brendonbrewer again  meaning less to you  but those who look good like them. As you like total cites.
@REasther @brendonbrewer agreed  overboard is bad  but using to your advantage is not.
@REasther @brendonbrewer my advise is to get advise on how best to present themselves
@REasther @brendonbrewer seeing a lack of discussion of publication stats  relative to others etc up front looks like hiding something
@REasther @brendonbrewer Grrr the point is not the merits of the h-index  but how you sell yourself. Pretending they don't exist is stupid.
@REasther @brendonbrewer it does contain information  and up to you to sell your publication stats. Ignoring this is ignorance.
@REasther @brendonbrewer yes  they will  &amp; total cites etc. but why make them work?
@REasther @brendonbrewer those that look good in total citations will support you.
@REasther @brendonbrewer h-index is not the problem. Academics refusing to be compared in a statistic that does not make them look good is.
@brendonbrewer you should put it at the start.
@brendonbrewer @ickbat You sir  do not have fine taste :)
@macastrosoc @sydney_uni As ever  it was great fun! Thanks for the invite and I look forward to your birthday party :)
@brendonbrewer or you could just get on and do something useful :)
@brendonbrewer once you've closed them  how do you read the rest of the instructions?
@sctrager @jegpeek Currently editing a 430 page book in word… So glad it was not in latex….
@peterdedmonds I made the mistake of reading the comments to the article. I love being called ignorant and stupid!
@brendonbrewer @michelle_lmc Spendvision!! Process for clearing work credit card (involving scanning in a pile of receipts).
@cathomas09 Well done!
@OmanReagan Although the astrobiology and SETI searches at @SETIInstitute aren't in my department.

@sondy [ reviews invective vocabulary ]  His conscience has been eaten by a dog.
@PlanetDr @elakdawalla @Alex_Parker It would be a very bad idea for me to drink  for many reasons.  Hence baking.
@elakdawalla @PlanetDr @Alex_Parker I wrote a large portion of a proposal today.  I will now resort to baking cranberry bars.
@erinleeryan If that's what is meant  then that's what should have been written (then it would have been right). @annevirkki @PlanetTreky
Suddenly  @PlanetTreky appears. https://t.co/81s6p7B3zW
@PlanetTreky Would be good to know who some of those are  and what exactly they're proposing.
@PlanetTreky One thing that still isn't clear to me: Who is submitting the proposals for continued operations to the NSF?
@PlanetTreky I am confused.  Where would all of the staff work?
.@MarsMaven and the other members of the @HiRISE team do good work.
@PlanetTreky NASA is right.
@PlanetTreky Congratulations!
@sondy I think most DPS+EPSC tweeps were at the Women In Planetary Science lunch when the TMT session was scheduled to happen.
@sondy I have no information about it.

@starstryder [ checks ]  Apparently  @MerriamWebster hasn't added it yet.  They should.
@SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla @sondy Developing the first version of what became the SHAPE software took Scott Hudson a while.
@SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla @sondy Steve Ostro got radar images of Castalia in 1989.  Took until 1993/1994 to extract 3D shape.
@sondy @SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla Radar images of Castalia 1989; Gaspra imaged by Galileo in 1991; Castalia shape model 1994.
@SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla @sondy [3/2] First 3D shape information for asteroids became available in 1991-93 (radar &amp; spacecraft).
@SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla @sondy [2/2] Radar silhouettes were available by 1990.  See e.g. Ostro 1993: https://t.co/6hiWXjgqMQ .
@SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla @sondy [1/2] The first radar detection of an asteroid was Icarus in 1968.  Shape modeling was later.
@kennicosmith Good luck with the move!
@cathomas09 Have a good trip back!
@erinleeryan @lukedones @moonyguy Although I think I understated the size of the problem.
@PlanetTreky Enjoy the Huntington!  Their Chinese garden is particularly well done.  And have a good trip back to PR!
@sondy @_hroe I am now tempted to ask G&amp;S fans I know if they could do an asteroid-themed spoof song.
@PlanetTreky ACM 2017?
@PlanetTreky Have it in Ballroom H too.
.@sondy and @asrivkin suggest thermal history test for other asteroids  such as Ryugu.  Probably not enough of Itokawa available...#DPSEPSC
.@sondy  tangentially: Those considering mining asteroids for water by baking them will want to consider Hg  As  S  Cd  etc. #DPSEPSC
.@sondy at #DPSEPSC: Laboratory work constraining the thermal history of @OSIRISREx's target Bennu.
@PlanetDr Enjoy Arizona  then.
@PlanetDr Have a good trip back across the continent!

@ProfAbelMendez @PlanetTreky Thanks for posting the link to this piece! @SETIInstitute
@PlanetTreky [ glares at offending NASA mission teams ]
@plutoprincessz That argument seems misplaced when it results in losing current capabilities.  But perhaps I am biased on this one.
@sondy Also  welcome to Pasadena!
@PlanetTreky @NAICobservatory Would be nice if NASA would pick up the bill...
@AscendingNode @sondy For planetary science  that is far too often true.
@starstryder Thanks for visiting #DPSEPSC yesterday!
@PlanetDr [ looks at offender's account ]  [ reports and blocks ]
Public outreach workshop at #DPSEPSC .  @starstryder et al. do good work.
@PlanetTreky @benjaminsharkey It also has a very extensive tea menu - https://t.co/1MgPFA7IiA .
@benjaminsharkey I'll be placing a reservation for a table at the tea house for 11:30 on the 16th: https://t.co/CWY4ogbGKJ . @PlanetTreky
@benjaminsharkey @PlanetTreky I cannot offer either mozzarella or rum.  I can offer tea at Chado.
@TheEarthStory Let me know if you figure a way to do that.
@erinleeryan @sondy @PlanetDr I took the Physics GRE twice; in April &amp; Oct. 2004. 2nd score was much higher - due only to test-specific prep

@brianwolven @Alex_Parker Maybe not make puns when I am considering things that are literally matters of life and death?
@StarzanPlanets @fossilfriendly @sondy US wide  disenfranchisement affects ~3% of voters.  And  as you wrote  concentrated in some states.
@PlanetDr I'm going to avoid the internet all evening.
@fossilfriendly @sondy And  least anyone forget: Former felons not being disenfranchised by itself would have resulted in Gore being elected
@sondy @karinsandstrom May the odds be ever in your favor.
@sondy I plan to avoid the internet for the whole of Sunday evening.
@NolaTRedd "What made all these different types of meteorites?" was a pretty complicated one to answer.
@ltelkins @sslmda [ salutes from Mountain View ]
@sondy Even for those propositions that would be good ideas; it's grossly inefficient to handle by referendum rather than the legislature.
@sondy @barbylon One of the propositions this time would mandate there being more propositions.  I think I will vote "no" for that.
@ltelkins Good luck!

@sondy @PlanetDr Good idea.
@OtherOrbScience But there are better ways to deal with that.
@OtherOrbScience Filter to minimize the number of UFO enthusiasts?
@erinleeryan @sondy @OtherOrbScience There is now an option to get DPS membership by having sponsors submit endorsement via email.
@OtherOrbScience @erinleeryan It would be good to have a secure online payment method.  Which isn't hard to set up.
@erinleeryan @OtherOrbScience @sondy I keep my membership to be able to present at the annual meeting.
@sondy If I count correctly  over the entire lifetime of DPS  all but 4 of the people ever on the committee have been white.  Not cool.
@sondy Interested parties may want to talk to @gummyshark  as a member of the nominating subcommittee.
@erinleeryan @sondy @OtherOrbScience I think I count as an AAS full member now.  Can sign for people.
@sondy @erinleeryan I haven't checked the supply chains there.
@sondy @erinleeryan Brushed metal  maybe?
@erinleeryan @sondy I was going more for tile being less expensive and not often produced by slave labor.
@erinleeryan @sondy Perhaps they simply want a heatproof counter after melting something.  I suggest tile.
@JLGalache That one is also good for showing that most of the surveys are in the northern hemisphere.
@starstryder And that fraction is quite a bit higher for black men.
@sondy I find conflicting reports about the extent of that.  But shipping it a quarter of the way around the world isn't cheap in any case.
@sondy Perhaps @ObservatoryCats explaining the importance of intersectional social justice to confused cats? https://t.co/xsTrEneiCD .
@sondy From a cursory survey  classism as well as ableism is pretty pervasive among vegans in the US (e.g. not everyone can afford quinoa).
@sondy I once tried to explain to such a person that I could do a vegan diet  but I'd be in pain most of the time.  They told me to suffer.
@caseycourval @sondy I could do without encountering quacks who promote ableist &amp; classist diet nonsense.
@xkcdComic @hubbahubble Clearly  he'll be very excited about @OSIRISREx  ARRM  and AIDA.
@PlanetDr @AstroKatie Or until a jet blows one spacecraft or the other (or both) out into space.
@sondy @DrMRFrancis I suggest we rename JWST after Annie Jump Cannon or Henrietta Swan Leavitt.
@elakdawalla @AstroKatie @cirquelar @astroengine Styrobraking ?
.@PlanetDr @ESA_Rosetta Now I'm not sure this is accurate.  What's the gravity on 67P versus that on Itokawa?
@PlanetDr For additional comparison: @SpaceX Falcon XX is very similar in launch mass capability to SLS Block 2.
@PlanetDr @AllPlanets And @SpaceX's single largest _customer_ is NASA.
@AllPlanets I submit that @SpaceX has not done that yet.  Let the large launch vehicle be built and flown first.
@EricDahlstrom1 They manage it most years.
@niais @upulie There's a lot of interest right now in small-scale solar electric propulsion.  e.g. send minisats to _all_ the asteroids...
@adamjohnsonNYC @starstryder That's a _very_ dark timeline.
@sondy As one does?
@tarahaelle @NolaTRedd [2/2] Actual number of young black men killed by police in 2015 was ~300 =&gt; one in 7.5 of young black men killed.
@tarahaelle @NolaTRedd [1/2] I apologize. I confused the number of young black men killed with the total number of people killed by police.
@JayAlver Your posts were _mansplaining_: https://t.co/RYQLOQFU8V .  Don't do that.   I am done.
@JayAlver @NovaSilisko Maybe not try to 'splain planetary exploration to @PlanetDr .
@verge @NellyBenHayoun Note: humans can't use that vehicle to go Europa or anywhere near Jupiter. They'd get fatal radiation poison in a day
@IBJIYONGI @sondy Good luck.
@schmemela @PlanetTreky @AreciboRadar And also ARRM.  Deflect _all_ the asteroids?
@Alex_Parker @PlanetDr https://t.co/LLtJrTokRY .
@tarahaelle @NolaTRedd ~2250 young black men killed by guns in US / year. Police killed 1134 young black men in 2015 https://t.co/75LrZWh8wq
@sondy Different fire.  The earlier one was nearer Salinas.  This one is further north.
@sondy https://t.co/wmEakdON7v
@sondy Good luck.
@sondy I'd attempt to send you some inoffensive Bay Area atmosphere  but we have a forest fire in the Santa Cruz mountains just now.
@NolaTRedd @tarahaelle @Forbes @SciShortform And for young black men  it's just about 1 in 2.
@PBS @NewsHour You should accompany this with a statement that Trump is blatantly lying  since Trump promotes killing 55 000 women.
@sondy @niais @PlanetDr @Summer_Ash I'm planning on doing a bicycle ride and avoiding Twitter at that time.
@niais @PlanetDr @Summer_Ash Good choice.
@megschwamb @astrotweeps Done.
@megschwamb @astrotweeps I'd be interested in taking the week of 2017 April 10  if you're scheduling that far out.  ACM 2017 happens then.
@sondy @vk2tfg And for a phased array to combine multiple low-power transmitters efficiency  it needs to fill most of the aperture.
@vk2tfg @sondy We already do that  transmitting continuously using either binary phase coding or a linear frequency chirp.
@vk2tfg @sondy FAST is also not designed to operate at shorter wavelengths than Arecibo is.
@vk2tfg @sondy [3/3] Lower wavelength means a smaller microwave resonant cavity; heat-sinking required per unit surface area doesn't change.
@vk2tfg @sondy [2/3] Lower power and equivalent sensitivity are possible only with a much larger antenna (expensive) or lower wavelength.
@vk2tfg @sondy [1/3] Astronomical radars are generally power-limited.  e.g. Arecibo has detected radar echoes that were tens of photons.
@BlaiseFEgan @sondy @moylecroft As Sondy wrote  there is a power-per-mass limit for normal electronics.  Exceed that  and things melt.
@sondy So many brogrammers...
@sondy Candida albicans shows up in about 90% of the population; and this report is based on small number statistics.  I suggest skepticism.
@RicardoHarvin That is true.    It's also unacceptable to say "people say Trump is truthful" without making it clear that Trump is a liar.
Yes.  And this _should not be a question_.  Do better  @CNN https://t.co/BnhtVPPvOy

@sondy Lately  I've been evaluating political candidates largely by the expected body-count of the politics they promote.
@amytoast What @sondy wrote.  Especially given McCain's recent nonsense re. Zika virus.
@PlanetTreky $5 in royalties means that about 5 copies were sold.
@PlanetTreky I had ~30 copies printed through https://t.co/QCt6CyCk03.  In exchange for reduced printing cost  they put it for sale.
@PlanetTreky I received a royalty check for people buying my thesis.  It was about $5.
@OSIRISREx Note: Normally  KSC -&gt; BNU would be  Košice  Slovakia -&gt; Blumenau  Brazil.

@niais @PlanetDr An alert bracelet / other identifier seems a very good idea.
@AstroKatie @AllPlanets @exploreplanets Paper says no transit signal with depth &gt;0.05.  But expected transit depth would be less than that.
@astrotweeps @AstroKatie There are limitations of ground-based radio observations here.  Very difficult to go &lt; 10 MHz and see anything.
@astrotweeps @AstroKatie At &gt;10 MHz  Jupiter flux &gt;10^4 x Earth flux.  Expected flux for Proxima b greater than Earth  but not by that much.
@astrotweeps @AstroKatie Exception is a range around ~300 kHz where auroral bursts on Earth are brighter: https://t.co/buiXaYhYKa .
@astrotweeps @AstroKatie Projects for radio detections of exoplanets have focused on Jupiter-mass planets.  Orders of magnitude brighter.
.@AstroKatie @AllPlanets @exploreplanets My understanding was that transits by Proxima b haven't been ruled out  but are unlikely (~1.5%) ?
@astrotweeps Gas giant mining probably not necessary. Asteroid/lunar mining would be  unless you wanted to irradiate launch zone on Earth.

@astronomolly @astrotweeps Tangent: Ken Liu  translator for Three Body &amp; Death's End  has his own fantasy series: https://t.co/SV02bir1yi
@astrotweeps The plot didn't make sense because I knew out what the final resolution was in 5 minutes  while the characters took 100 years.
@astrotweeps "creepy" as in "is a sexual predator"  and the narrative doesn't seem to realize why what he is doing is evil.
@astronomolly @astrotweeps And the plot of Dark Forest didn't make any sense.
@astronomolly @astrotweeps I haven't read "Death's End".  But the protagonist of "The Dark Forest" was extremely creepy.
@astronomolly @astrotweeps Three-Body is good.  But I don't recommend the sequels.

@sondy Stop by SETI if you'd like to see what the summer students are up to.  I'll be around through about 3:30 PM Wednesday.
@erinleeryan @sondy I did consider a proposal to PDART to hire a programmer to rebuild everything.  Did not have time to write the proposal.
@sondy @benjaminsharkey @erinleeryan I should learn more Python...
@benjaminsharkey They're having you use IRAF?  Woah.
@OmanReagan ... control @OSIRISREx.
The data must flow: https://t.co/WeCOouLzYh ( @OSIRISREx   @CanberraDSN )
@Enceladosaurus I have seen https://t.co/kvRUZGIIDk recommended (by @GretaChristina ).  [ checks other replies ]  [ sees @OtherOrbScience ]
@OmanReagan I'm not used to thinking of auditoriums in large research complexes as fieldwork sites.  But okay. @MarsMaven
@MarsMaven @hubbahubble Colloquia at @SETIInstitute are open to the public. Currently hosted by Microsoft Research: https://t.co/bEsSaAXpFO
.@hubbahubble will be visiting @SETIInstitute again next week. https://t.co/twkLYeclMI
@sondy 良心被狗吃了 ?
@sondy Good luck!
@shaka_lulu Good luck with management.
@shaka_lulu I don't discount your personal experience. But no one has yet found a non-celiac gluten-specific reaction (as SBM writers note).
@shaka_lulu As an aside: Rate of celiac in people with predisposing genes is increasing with time: https://t.co/tvAHrAUGJC .  Not clear why.
@shaka_lulu I had read that  as well as the papers it references.  I've been motivated to follow the celiac-related literature lately.
@shaka_lulu It really isn't  once wheat allergy &amp; IBS are controlled for: https://t.co/wGE5OycXne. And  of course  nothing to do with GMOs.
@shaka_lulu [ headdesk ] As someone with celiac disease  I _really_ don't like that particular bit of nonsense.
@PlanetDr Does @NASAJPL still have the "Speed Checked by Radar" sign along that road? #TeamRadar
@asrivkin @PlanetDr Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir also seems well-qualified.
@asrivkin @PlanetDr Merkel has a PhD in chemistry...
@erinleeryan @PlanetDr And my information is likewise several years out-of-date.  Good luck.
@erinleeryan @PlanetDr I also recall a large number of people doing science at the Pete's on Lake and California.
@PlanetDr Addendum: The one in the Chinese garden.
@PlanetDr I liked the tea house at the Huntington.
.@astrotweeps Do you have any information on plans for ISM observations with FAST?
@theAGU [2/2] Don't erase the problem that you seek to address.
@theAGU [1/2] This statement does not mention what the recent incidents have been. e.g. people being murdered by police for not being white.

@sondy Tagging @ltelkins and @barbylon .
@chosenhorse2 Cut out the whitesplaining. @BroderickGreer
@IBJIYONGI What @sondy wrote.
@TheProfRobin What you have written is entirely unhelpful.  Cut out the racist irrelevancies. @claranellist @IBJIYONGI
@sondy I've seen the roads.
@cirquelar @sondy One motivation for the new rule in California was that w/o regulation  nobody knows what's in the vapor.
@sondy Just as long as nobody who doesn't want to be inhaling whatever the vapers may be vaping isn't subjected to it.
@sondy How does UofA deal with vaping? Vapers are making a stink about a California initiative to regulate it like any other tobacco product
@sondy Also  expect cats.
@sondy [ consults map ]  Okay then.  You haven't suddenly decided to drive across the Darién Gap.
@PlanetDr ARRM: "Do you even lift?"
@DrJenGunter I submit that it was grossly irresponsible for @CNN to hire Lewandowski.
@erinleeryan @sondy [ side-eye ]
@erinleeryan @sondy I don't get how institutions justify paying people less than the GSA rates.
@sondy @erinleeryan The salaries they're advertising aren't too far off from starting PhD-level salaries at SETI.
@sondy @erinleeryan https://t.co/LsOciXADd1   isn't it?
@sondy @Alex_Parker Not too late for afternoon tea at the Dushanbe.
@YFYAUK @astrotweeps Cool!  First satellite =&gt; first private satellite because prior sats by Nigeria  South Africa  Egypt  etc. governments?
@sondy @asrivkin And the time I had to explain why I was traveling to MSP from SFO with two fossilized horse teeth (gift shopping at AGU).
@sondy @asrivkin My personal stories are limited to having to provide receipts for a half-dozen assorted packets of tea.
@elsisrad See also @haya2_jaxa / @haya2e_jaxa
@elsisrad The ARRM project has got that.
@Lynne73 Participants in #NASAFDL should be around Cal Academy too.  They may have questions re. LSST. @erikanesvold @AlisonBLowndes

@sondy #asteroidastronomer?
@AlisonBLowndes Here's @Alex_Parker's rendering of @sdssurveys asteroid data: https://t.co/CVBZohYpA5 .
@sondy @PlanetDr @niais I have a short list of such offenders  and I know that it is extremely far from complete.  So. Yeah.
.@AlisonBLowndes gives an overview of current machine learning and GPU capabilities for #nasafdl.  [ pays attention ]
@AlisonBLowndes describes @nvidia GPU units being used to control R2D2 robots.  @R2Keri - relevant to your interests?
@TheEarthStory H is mostly chemically bonded to O (as H2O or as OH).  Pulling that out of the matrix requires heating to &gt;500 K.
@sondy That was a separate noble-gas study.
.@sondy Has anyone tried baking a sample of Orgueil?  Supposed to be a good analog for 2008 EV5.  But only geochem on it I remember was Xe.
Attention @GoDeepSpace and @PlanetaryRsrcs https://t.co/Uuf8pV5Ooq

@sondy [ looks at offender's Tweets ] [ reports ] [ blocks ]
.@PlanetTreky is cool. https://t.co/xlzPEBeIsz
@shaka_lulu Fermi problem?
@astrotweeps This is true  from talking to doctors I know.  Likewise for cops &amp; lawyers watching "Law &amp; Order" or "CSI".
@cathomas09 I can't access the full text - SETI's institute subscriptions are erratic.  Sorry  and good luck.
@cathomas09 [ reads ]
@cathomas09 If you send me a link to the paper concerned  I can see if I can make sense of it.
@cathomas09 What particular application?
@niais @PlanetDr Good luck over there.
@SpaceGeck Cosign.  @sondy
@sondy @srayyyyy I'm not sure what is more infuriating  such uninformed "advice" or outright denialism (e.g. "you don't have celiac").
@PlanetTreky I may submit a late abstract for a poster.  I suspect the early deadline is a strategy to reduce competition for talks.
@ClaraJeffery @sondy Striking that he considers the alleged insult to be to Woolworth's and not to the Greensboro 4.
@mcnees @niais It's disturbing that @RepMarkWalker  who represents Greensboro  would reference Woolworth's and not the Greensboro Four.
@astronomolly @niais @mcnees [4/2] Different motivations: prior protest was "vote on people making money".  This is "vote on saving lives".
@astronomolly @niais @mcnees [3/2] The Republicans advocating for more off-shore oil drilling were also wrong to do so.
@astronomolly @niais @mcnees [2/2] The Democrats were wrong to turn things off then.  The Republicans were wrong to do so now.
@astronomolly @niais @mcnees [1/2] 2008. The Democrats refused to allow a vote on authorizing off-shore oil drilling.  Republicans objected.
@RepMarkWalker: You should go and learn some history - https://t.co/Sjz4OPkajl . @mcnees @niais
@mcnees @niais It seems that @RepMarkWalker is also unaware that Woolworth's was on the wrong side of the Greensboro sit-ins.
@Ehmee Attention @ObservatoryCats - you have competition.
.@OSIRISREx Also  Toutatis' spin state is _complicated_.  See Takahashi  Busch  &amp; Scheeres 2013: https://t.co/OyyCNwbHoZ .
Britney Schmidt is cool.  @RobertPicardo is also cool. https://t.co/EvbHkYdeKK
@sondy @IBJIYONGI I can attempt to educate  if the offender won't pay attention otherwise.
@now7grandkids @starstryder Also a problem: That lobbying by the gun industry has prevented any actual comprehensive gun control legislation
@now7grandkids @starstryder Terror watch list is non-predictive &amp; racist.  Republicans refusing to require background checks is the problem.
@PlanetTreky Earworm summoned.  Well-played.  @benjaminsharkey
@PlanetTreky It would be nice if funding weren't literally contingent on someone's winning the lottery...
@benjaminsharkey You can test it by adding &amp; removing "speckle  yes" as a line in a write-action parameter file and seeing what happens.
@benjaminsharkey [2/2] But if the number of looks is small  the high-power tail in the noise distribution matters.
@benjaminsharkey [1/2] Each FFT gives chi-square distributed noise: https://t.co/vnkebbXlIS .  Adding many together approximates normal.
@benjaminsharkey That seems high.  If the number of looks is small  you might check to make sure the "speckle" parameter is set to "yes".
@PlanetDr @Alex_Parker Only emails from Mars.
@benjaminsharkey That is also generally accurate.  Good luck.
@robminchin @sondy [ clicks ] "We are experiencing higher than normal volume and are unable to service your request at this time"  Hmm...
@DrMRFrancis @PlanetDr @RachelFeltman We could get a leash for it.  Would take a few years  though.
@WeatherOnMars @sondy @brianwolven @mcnees I once saw someone cite Archimedes in a physics paper. But I think that was probably unnecessary.
@erinleeryan @cathomas09 I saw them filming.  It was strange - at one point  they brought in a bunch of faux-marble fiberglass statues.
@PlanetDr I require an equivalent for Facebook's "angry" reaction.
@PlanetDr Point.  I'm sorry if I hit a trigger.
@PlanetDr Two weeks ago  a professor was gunned down at UCLA across the science quad from what used to be my office.  We're far past enough.
@themadhatter355 The point.  You appear to have missed it.  More guns =&gt; more people being killed by partners. @leilasedai
@lukedones @niais I don't like "originalism" 's veneration of classist  sexist  and racist slavers.
@xeni @DrJenGunter Paul Manafort  now working for Trump's campaign  used to "lead the torturer's lobby": https://t.co/lxkW0Gbf0n .
@sondy Congratulations!
@benjaminsharkey ... Which data is this?
@VealSlab @niais I'm an atheist. I have seen many atheists who promote sexism  racism  albeism  &amp; heterosexism. They are dangerously wrong.
@VealSlab @niais  McVeigh was an agnostic for much of his life.  Being non-religious doesn't magically erase bigotry and hatred.

@PlanetTreky @annevirkki @AreciboRadar Thanks to Patrick and everyone else who put that proposal together!
@noavgbitch @sondy For those who prefer dogs  @PlanetDr has @booplefloof.
@noavgbitch @sondy @ObservatoryCats There is also @GeologyCat.
@sondy ... Did you arrange to send them a cat?  @ObservatoryCats
@PlanetDr What's the question?
@sondy Neither do I.  I just buy the occasional show that looks good from iTunes.
@Alex_Parker @sondy @JamesSACorey Bonus of knowing planetary science while watching The Expanse: knowing what they based the CGI on.
@sondy Shohreh Aghdashloo does the spooky ambiguously-amoral character of Chrisjen Avasarala quite well.
@sondy Have you seen "The Expanse" ?  Or perhaps too many asteroids in that one...
@PlanSciCRichey @IBJIYONGI @erinleeryan @mcnees @astrochic73 @niais We _really_ need to get rid of these nonsense "fitness" displays.
@erinleeryan @sondy Actually  how we do the averaging may be bigger still.  e.g. 50% of asteroid mass is in largest dozen or so objects.
@erinleeryan @sondy I think the lower size limit is the biggest effect.  e.g. is a 1-m block an asteroid or a meteroid?  A 10-cm one?  1-cm?
@sondy Depends entirely on where we put the lower size limit  and on how we do the averaging.
@sondy Context on that one??
@hubbahubble I can't speak to that one.  But congratulations on all of the invited talks!
@hubbahubble If it's the lunch after the SETI colloquium  not at all.
@PlanetTreky Not something to be sorry for.
@PlanetTreky ... I'm hoping that's per person and not total.
As I wrote: follow @PlanetTreky (&amp; also @nadiamdrake ) if you want to know about the NSF review of @NAICobservatory https://t.co/0SGPNMDupI
@erinleeryan @lukedones Mine was "Here is the VLBA science data archive".
@janerrigby @nhuntwalker @nhuntwalker I could try eating a piece of an asteroid  but that would be a poor choice for many reasons.
@sondy @hubbahubble It is the same day as LunGradCon.  Our summer students will have to make a choice.
.@hubbahubble will be visiting @SETIInstitute again in July.  Those near Mountain View may want to go to her talk. https://t.co/p32zed2Gmx
@Wikisteff @sondy @PlanetDr I don't have a lab.  They just let me play with @AreciboRadar sometimes.
@PlanetDr At @AreciboRadar  there is a crowbar alarm.  Also known as "dropped a metal rod across the power supply to stop a voltage spike".
@PlanetDr ( checks )  The group block list I subscribe to has already blocked that one.  Well done  group block list.
@PlanetDr ... ... Time to install a barometer in the lab?
@PlanetDr May the odds be ever in your favor.
@sondy [ looks at headers in MPML digest email ] [ pushes to archive without scrolling through the rest of it ]
@PlanetDr Really?  I thought it was liquid in the lakes... [ goes to look up phase diagram ]
@PlanetDr Where do you find ethane ice?
@sondy It is entirely reasonable to request money for doing science.
@kennicosmith Space rabbit? https://t.co/3B4uPYxS3b
@motherboard @hubbahubble Gertz was formerly chair of the SETI Institute _Board of Trustees_.  He no longer is: https://t.co/5pbRcBlDP7 .
@motherboard @hubbahubble This article misrepresents Gertz' history with the SETI Institute.
@sondy Airfare to Tenerife is surprisingly affordable.
@sondy [ looks at forecast for Phoenix ]  "Excessive heat warning"  Okay then.  Southern Arizona is not currently in the habitable zone...
@CanberraDSN @1_Last_Thing Alternative option: Build a bigger antenna on Earth.  Which DSS-43 had done for @NASAVoyager at Neptune in 1989.
@sondy [ raises budget spreadsheet in salute ]
@sondy You're right.  Krauss has a long history of unacceptable behavior. @ASU really should do something about that.
@AlexGabriel @sondy Hey  @ASU: Do something about Lawrence Krauss.
@PlanetDr I was once told that the volume of paperwork for a Shuttle launch was measured in units of Shuttle-stack-heights.
@kennicosmith Thanks!  There is a Sprouts five blocks from where I live in Mountain View...

@hubbahubble opens talk @SETIInstitute with some astrophysics art. Perhaps @kildall /other the SETI artists-in-residence would be interested
@asrivkin My solution was to be logged in as myself in Firefox and as @astrotweeps in Chrome.
@sondy @hubbahubble According to @SETIInstitute internal schedule  1200 Pacific.
@hubbahubble I heard that you'll be visiting @SETIInstitute tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to your talk!
@AllPlanets Maybe not phrase it like that  given the large mistakes in what Myhrvold wrote.
Scientists: Pay attention to what @sondy has written. https://t.co/2XlOPlg8M5
@Enceladosaurus I seem to recall @PlanetTreky knowing some ASL.
@sondy @kat_volk They also have the thinned-array curse working against them.
@kat_volk @sondy That and the range limit.  We could work further out with a Ka-band radar on GBT.  Anyone have a spare 30 million USD?
@sondy @kat_volk @NolaTRedd @Yeqzids [2/2]... Likewise for DSS-13 with current transmit power. But both are much less sensitive than Arecibo
@sondy @kat_volk @NolaTRedd @Yeqzids [1/2] DSS-43+Parkes doesn't have that problem (although CBR traffic pattern is a concern). ...
@sondy @kat_volk @NolaTRedd @Yeqzids Arecibo also provides much higher signal-to-noise for many of the targets that could be seen elsewhere.
@sondy @kat_volk @NolaTRedd @Yeqzids Arecibo can observe about twice as many asteroids as DSS-14  and four times as many as DSS-43+Parkes.
@asrivkin [ adds to list of useful references for when people ask about learning astronomy ] @sondy
@asrivkin You wrote a book?  @sondy
@astronomeara @astroprofhoff Has everyone who would be impacted by construction at the alternate sites approved such plans?
@asrivkin @kat_volk @sondy Thirded.
@WeatherOnMars Columbia still gets a lot of funding from grants for which grad students are essential labor. @sondy
@sondy This also seems to be a good time to point out that Columbia takes an indirect cost rate of up to 60% grants.

@Lars_Jeppesen The point.  You appear to have missed it. @PlanetDr @sondy
@sondy Pretty sure that was snark.

@sondy I avoided further conversation.
@sondy Ouch. ... Maybe still better than the guy who told me I should eat emmer "because its paleo"  knowing that I have celiac?
@sondy Does she not understand that homeopaths are pushing nothing but water and glucose?
@merrdiff @sondy [ repeated headdesk ]
Scientists: Read what @PlanetTreky is writing. https://t.co/OBjfKaZBPT
@PlanetTreky @RonBaalke And FAST's sensitivity is just about the same as @NAICobservatory - just over a wider declination range.
@sondy "Favorited" only for the description of a serious problem.
@notfroggie @sondy Epi is a wonderful thing.
@sondy I don't know.  Cursory review says "ask the allergist".
@sondy Worthwhile to investigate immunotherapy?  I'm told allergists have targeted mixtures for pollens found in different areas.
@sondy Good luck.
@sondy Seems like being allergic to saguaro would be a significant liability in Tuscon.
@PlanetTreky If we could mount a DSS-14-equivalent transmitter at Tidbinbilla or Shanghai  then FAST bistatic could equal @AreciboRadar .
@sondy [ passes virtual warm beverages ]
@PlanetTreky FAST can't mount a transmitter.  So for #TeamRadar  @AreciboRadar is the best thing there is.
@tweetsoutloud @AstroKatie *unless you are a radar astronomer who wants to observe Mercury when it is as close to Earth as possible.
@boguta And  as @sondy wrote  if someone is harassing people they are doing physics very badly.
@astrotweeps I recognize that view.  Enjoy the observatory!
@sondy I'm not really liking @twitter's new harassment-reporting system.  No  I don't need to see the offending tweets again...
@sondy [ headdesk ] [ Reports that user for harassment.  Again. ]
@sondy @mike_malaska I find the Moon matters a fair bit.  Mostly because it keeps messing up the asteroid-finding ...

@PlanetaryKeri @fcain Credit for that estimate goes to Ron Maddalena at @TheNRAO as well as to @amyjlovell .
@PlanetaryKeri @fcain [2/2]production from comets.  Estimate was that comet outgassing is too low by at least 8 orders of magnitude.
@PlanetaryKeri @fcain [1/2] When Paris first proposed this idea  @jilltarter &amp; I consulted with @amyjlovell  who relayed estimates of H2...
@starstryder Have you heard any of the meteorite-smuggler stories?
@asrivkin @elakdawalla @lukedones You can blame Galileo himself for starting that one.
@TheEarthStory I had seen that.  My question is if such a young surface age is geologically / geophysically plausible.
@sondy There are case reports. It depends on how much bergamot is consumed &amp; on kidney function. I'd rather not be a test case myself.
@sondy May you not need steroids again.

@sondy Tangentially: furanocoumarins are strange.
@WeatherOnMars @megschwamb For relevant expert commentary  The Guardian should have asked @amyjlovell or other comet radio experts.
@WeatherOnMars @megschwamb When the prior is "observations that would have seen X if X happens didn't"  TACs become reluctant.
@WeatherOnMars @megschwamb In Paris' case  other radio observations of comets - which happen regularly - should have seen what he proposes.
