-1	@KARiley40 The radiation penetrates less than a meter into the ice crust. The radiation is worse on the trailing hemisphere (rear) of Europa
1	@SciFiGeneration What we want to confirm is habitability first  before we take the next step  which is landing.
1	@SpacetimeLabs The discovery of plumes doesn't change priorities for Europa mission  it validates them. Helps us ask different questions.
1	@davidwdubois They would not be expected
1	@JPMajor None so far - the only thing that we know is that Europa has an oxygen exosphere.
1	@ckawohl We’ve officially decided in favor of the Europa flyby mission. The launch date we’re currently working toward is 2022.
1	@ashren - @NASAWebb will have a different view of Europa - observing it in the infrared. The signature of water would be seen differently.
1	@GalileoMoon Europa flyby mission will look at the habitability. The next question for a future mission would be to search for life.
1	@waynoo1 Congress has directed NASA to begin studies of a lander mission to launch in 2024. We're assessing feasibility of that direction.
1	@ThinkAvatarRI There's an ongoing scientific debate as to how we go about finding life. Will determine instruments sent on future missions.
1	@RoryStoves We don’t know - possibly tectonics caused by tides &amp; other stresses on Europa. Hope to find out someday.
-1	@grunzwanzling42 We want to protect from contamination. If we get to sample  want to know it is from Europa &amp; not something brought with us
1	@subodhdeshpand4 Probably has similar starting ingredients to Earth--ice  water  rock--but we don’t have any proof that life is there.
1	@henrygeenature Yes  “as certain as we can be without swimming there”. Magnetosphere measurements from Galileo tell us the ocean is there.
1	@SakavJagam Europa is outside of the “habitable zone’ in our solar system but certainly has liquid water inside it - it’s a special case

1	@pmetschan @astrolisa Scientists were excited to have their 1st soil sample data from SAM &amp; the instrument was performing *beautifully*
1	@astrolisa Simple: the data was being analyzed. An announcement at that time- either way- would have been premature.
1	@BobbieBees I signed up for a one-way trip. Looking forward to the sol when there are human bootprints next to my rover tracks

1	Still there from your #SidingSpring #MarsComet encounter #MEX @MAVEN2Mars @MarsRovers @HiRISE @MarsOrbiter #MarsOdyssey #MRO?
1	@SungrazerComets hopefully I won’t have a need to hide from #67P! :)
1	@muddasick @JPMajor @ObservingSpace not yet! But I’m only about 10km away these days. I deploy @Philae2014 to the surface on 12 nov
1	@Lee_Chetwynd @JPMajor I’m staying with the comet at least through 2015  if that counts! :)
1	RT @Philae2014: #67P Are you ready? I'm almost there... #Philae https://t.co/sH2xOdoIhq #RosettaAreWeThereYet #comet @DLR_en @DLR_de
1	@marksugruek you don't have to print a life-size version ;)
1	.@MAVEN2Mars @MarsCuriosity @MarsRovers @HiRISE #SidingSpring has quite a welcome party - my mate @esa Mars Express is there too! #mex
1	Hey @MarsOrbiter @MAVEN2Mars  hope you’re settling in well at #Mars  I was there in ’07! http://t.co/02mUBNXH0i http://t.co/RAFZYbToLf
1	Hi #Timor! @Cmdr_Hadfield @NasaVoyager @ISEE3Reboot are right  we're happy in space! I'm at comet #67P with @philae2014! #SpaceBuddies
1	@hugovdm @SabotagedFool you'll find the numbers in the blog post – my orbital period was nearly 14 days for a 30 km orbit
1	@mggtTaylor Hope you are planning lots more awesome science for me to do at #67P :)
-1	@masanorimusic @Philae2014 will have to hang on tight!
1	@Factorialpython @ksundeep_ #67P is on a 6.5year orbit around the Sun; I plan to stay alongside at least thro 2015
1	@astropuckett @megschwamb comet is an artist impression in this one  as described in caption. Diagram is to illustrate my current trajectory
1	@historytoby @Philae2014 @esa @DLR_de @DLR_en @esa @esaoperations #67P rotates once every 12.4 hours
1	@PumaBare I take photos  but my friends on Earth like to put them together to make nice movies!
1	.@joannekarma @esaoperations Yes  please feel free to download  use &amp; share my latest social media theme kit! http://t.co/HITvSVJPD5
1	@cosmos4u At least until start Aug (i.e. up to arrival). Time depends on imaging schedule for each day  downlink opportunities etc
1	@mars_stu yes  it is today  at 15:00 CEST
1	.@FitzsimmonsAlan @ESO *waves* http://t.co/sA8red1DcK
1	@JensKrabbe1 @esascience @apod It's rotating about once per 12.4 hours
1	#OTD in 1985  my grandfather Giotto launched on a mission to Comet Halley! https://t.co/nbkVXhKUPS http://t.co/Bg8ozOlWky @ESA_History
1	@micahspear @CRKARLA @NASA yes  surface photos when I’m closer  and once I’ve arrived at the comet in August
1	Project scientist @mggtTaylor &amp; Klim Churyumov  co-discoverer of my target #comet #67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko http://t.co/6ydtB98ndR #ACM2014
1	.@shadow404 I'm not yet close enough to see any landmarks  but not long to go now!
1	@boundangle coma is diffuse &amp; will extend 1000s kms into space; I'll be orbiting within a few 10s of kms &amp; will see the comet surface
1	@nick_attree Me too!! :)
1	@weasdown It's with respect to the comet.
1	Seen the giant comet #67P model in Brooklyn Bridge Park yet? Great exhibition as part of @WorldSciFest #WSF14 http://t.co/7lZwp7O5bV
1	@WilksJeremy Me too! According to the preliminary report (http://t.co/tuKMvAmZQz) my @esaoperations  friends will know in a few days.
1	#rosettatour now in Helsinki for 2 days. Here’s the trucked parked at Narinkka  Kamppi Center  by @jarimakinen http://t.co/wM1qoIBvxk
1	@akanel @Paxi_ESAKids Hey @philae2014  you've shrunk! The spacecraft models on the #RosettaTour are 1:4 scale.
1	@shadow404 My team should have an update on how it went tomorrow morning
1	@jarimakinen @stenichele In reality I have 5 of those solar panels on each side &amp; measure 32m across! How big is the #rosettatour truck?!
1	.@OSIRISREx haha :) Lots of cool stuff in the #rosettatour truck  see here for info: http://t.co/9knxweUGNl
1	.@shadow404 Hopefully we can replace the artist impressions in this animation with real comet images once I'm closer! http://t.co/2ZMFTNMHna
1	.@shadow404 Yes  I saw it from afar last month (http://t.co/hWnnvVMYPM). These images will help refine my trajectory as I get closer.
1	@AnoushehAnsari I’m awake already :) Next challenge is to wake up all my instruments and get them ready to do science at comet #67P!
1	@cosmos4u don’t forget also the fantastic insights we’ve had from the likes of Deep Impact and Stardust in more recent years!
1	@cosmos4u well maybe it does close up  who knows  altho I hope to find a less mountainous looking place for Philae to land than that!
1	@ct_la @flowalong @elakdawalla hi! I arrive at the comet in August so expect close up views then. I deploy my lander @Philae2014 in Nov
1	@zombie_media @tiffanyfarrant @apod I look forward to sharing lots of new photos of comet #67P with you later in the year!
1	@shadow404 Thank you! I can't wait to arrive at the comet either!
1	.@shadow404 there's some great launch footage at the start of this nice video of my mission highlights so far: http://t.co/4Zb3Ywu4PK
1	@shadow404 that pic was taken at about 1000 km  but a few minutes later I was only 250 km away!
1	I'm on here! MT @esascience: Where are they now? Infographic tracking 25 active space missions: http://t.co/RmdhLrvKis via @WorldSciFest
1	@TestaRossa1980 Thank you! Here's a picture of full-size me before I launched: http://t.co/3RSSXDyaGz
1	.@shadow404 You can read about how I will slow down and rendezvous with comet #67P here: http://t.co/qoA7zJ3wlK
1	@SungrazerComets I'm looking forward to comparing our results!
1	.@PappyNick @localJoost I can fly orbits that are under 30 km from the comet  otherwise I will follow alongside or make flybys
1	@marco_t A sleeping probe cannot tweet.
-1	@edan2154 Opposition was May 22  but since the orbits of Mars + Earth aren't perfectly circular  closest approach is May 30
1	@xenateach Today's news is from another Mars mission — @MAVEN2Mars
1	@litsas Thanks… reposted with corrected URL.

1	Say cheese  Oppy! A new view from MRO's @HiRISE camera spots the rover at work beside Santa Maria crater: http://1.usa.gov/hunu2O
1	@evildrganymede You can buy red/cyan 3-D glasses online from sites like this one: http://bit.ly/at2e7K
1	Oppy's view at Concepcion crater in 3D  courtesy @Mars_Stu (u have 3D red/blue glasses by your computer by now  right?) http://bit.ly/bYYJ8J
1	@nickyducky No water there  but certainly some very curious places to explore. This is a "young" crater  perhaps 1000 yrs old?
1	Oppy is at Concepcion crater finding some enticing targets for further study. Fan @Mars_Stu compiled pics here: http://bit.ly/9icFBD
-1	@NatureNews An obit? Thx  but news of my death has been greatly exaggerated! Maybe an entry here is needed: http://bit.ly/cIAGND
1	@alicesastroinfo Genders for the rovers? Not officially but team members refer to both as females  -- they are our "ships" to Mars.
-1	@marsroverdriver *waving back!* Was trying to find 5 Yrs on Mars on a site accessible to folks outside U.S. Hulu & Nat Geo are US only :(
1	@rhpueschner We like the Exploratorium site too. The raw data & images are fed to the site from @NASAJPL (http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov)
1	Amazing what rover fans can do w/ the data! From @doug_ellison an overflight of Spirit's location using @HiRISE data: http://is.gd/3zzu5
-1	@Jim_Ballard Testing continues at NASA-JPL on methods of driving Spirit out of the sand trap.
1	Spirit is celebrating sol 2000 on Mars today! From @mars_stu a lovely new astropoem on the 2K milestone:  http://bit.ly/2QrYo0
-1	@rbonini there is a rover rss feed (perhaps poorly promoted) Find it at www.jpl.nasa.gov/freespirit under the rover graphic.
1	@martiansoil No RSS from Free Spirit page only  but all rover updates are worth receiving :)  You'll be alerted here to new Spirit updates.
1	RT @VeronicaMcG I'm waiting for the day the rover drivers start wearing  "Free Spirit" T-shirts to work.  Anyone want to design one?
-1	@davidsoranno Oppy is on opposite side of Mars  so can't get to Spirit. But engineers used Oppy to test the belly shot before Spirit did it.
1	Thanks to @Nancy_A for this story on Julian  Spirit efforts to get free http://tinyurl.com/73fm3
1	Spirit has been spotted from above many times too. @Mars_Stu has a nice blog post about Spirit sightings with the pics: http://tr.im/h26h

1	@Mahoney2John @NASA This is called phototropism  and it's one way that plants grow.
1	@Algae_Lady @NASA_SLS Absolutely true. Though in @Space_Station  the recycling process takes only 8 days. On Earth  it takes years!
1	@mashtater66 @NASA_SLS If you think about it  all the water you drink is also recycled on a planetary scale.
1	@astro_reid @PC0101 @BlueEnigma @AstroTerry The Actiwatch records light and activity for a sleep study. More here: http://t.co/TeGhpRTtBF
1	@GavinWoltjer @NASA_SLS The water you drink is recycled  too - it just takes a lot longer on Earth.

1	@cour_jester Kinda  but the microwaves are coming from Jupiter itself. 1 of our antennas does sense the wavelength used by microwave ovens!

1	Accomazzo: We have all the data that @ESA_EDM transmitted #ExoMars
1	Accomazzo: Doppler data (recorded by #MarsExpress) does not correspond to the data reported by @ESA_EDM - we are analysing this #ExoMars
1	Accomazzo: @ESA_EDM stopped transmitting on the order of ~50secs before the expected touch-down time #ExoMars
1	Accomazzo: We expect @NASAJPL orbiters to attempt imaging the @ESA_EDM landing site in the coming days #ExoMars
1	Parker: All the data we get from @ESA_EDM feeds directly into our #ExoMars2020 mission #ExoMars
1	Accomazzo: We also saw that the ground radar was activated and providing data to @ESA_EDM #ExoMars
1	Accomazzo: I am extremely confident that we'll be able to fully understand what happened to @ESA_EDM #ExoMars
1	Accomazzo: From the data  we saw the @ESA_EDM thrusters firing for a few seconds - more analysis to come #ExoMars
1	Overflights by @NASAJPL's #MRO have not gotten any data from @ESA_EDM - more overflights are planned #ExoMars
1	Andrea Accomazzo: V. difficult to say condition of @ESA_EDM We will be able to determine the dynamics l8r  after all data analysed #ExoMars
1	.@janwoerner: We got the data  we did the test  so I am very happy @ESA_EDM #ExoMars https://t.co/k8zlKO8WjX
1	We've demonstrated that @ESA_TGO's second mission - data relay - is working  as we got the data from @ESA_EDM #ExoMars
1	Data analysis is ongoing  but it will take more time to get a full picture #ExoMars @ESA_EDM
1	We've downloaded data from @ESA_EDM entry &amp; descent #ExoMars - heatshield worked perfectly
1	Experts will work through the night to assess the @ESA_EDM situation - next news will be tomorrow morning at 10:00 CEST #ExoMars
1	#ESOC Ops Head Paolo Ferri reports "we still have much investigation to do" on @ESA_EDM #ExoMars
1	Next opportunity to hear from @ESA_EDM will be the relay pass with @NASAJPL's MRO spacecraft - should come in the next hour or two #ExoMars
1	.@ESA_EDM recording from #MarsExpress is inconclusive - not clear yet what the status of the lander is #ExoMars
1	#MarsExpress recording of @ESA_EDM descent is now processed and is being analysed by experts at #ESOC #ExoMars
1	#MarsExpress team now processing @ESA_EDM landing recording to extract the trace of the lander's signal as it descended to Mars #ExoMars
1	.@ashren @ESA_EDM recording from #MarsExpress is signal only  no telemetry. We can already tell a lot from that though #ExoMars
1	.@tsrandall @kona404 Interpretation of the @ESA_EDM recording is quite complex - could take more than 30 minutes #ExoMars
1	.@kona404 it will take just over 10 minutes for #MarsExpress to transmit the @ESA_EDM recording #ExoMars
1	The @ESA_EDM landing recording from #MarsExpress has started arriving on Earth  #ESOC teams report seeing packets flowing #ExoMars
1	Engineer @marwood82 report to #FlightDirector: size of @ESA_EDM recording on-board #MarsExpress is consistent with expected size #ExoMars
1	#MarsExpress has started transmitting the @ESA_EDM landing recording. Even at light speed it will take 9m47s to reach Earth #ExoMars
1	.@StephenClark1 #MarsExpress was recording carrier only like #GMRT  @ESA_TGO was recording telemetry #ExoMars
1	At Mars #MarsExpress is now powering up its main transmitter ready to beam the @ESA_EDM landing recording back to Earth #ExoMars
1	.@Kizmo51 it should be around 1.5 hours before we have replayed and processed the @ESA_EDM recording #ExoMars

1	#MarsExpress is now swinging away from Mars  getting ready to point its main antenna at Earth and downlink the @ESA_EDM recording #ExoMars
1	A clearer assessment of the situation will come when #MarsExpress replays the recording of @ESA_EDM descent #ExoMars
-1	End of planned @ESA_EDM transmission - still no signal at #GMRT - this is not unexpected due to very faint signal at #GMRT #ExoMars
1	High above @ESA_EDM  #MarsExpress has finished listening to the Schiaparelli  ready to relay the recording to Earth #ExoMars
1	Still waiting for signal of @ESA_EDM touchdown from #GMRT #ExoMars
1	#GMRT signal increase indicated @ESA_EDM is now on its main antenna  flying free from the parachute #ExoMars

1	@cosmos4u Yes!
-1	@cosmos4u sorry.  Ecliptic longitude  NOT right ascension.
1	@cosmos4u I noticed several European sources using the Oct. 29 date. Could they have been using ecliptic longitude  right ascension?
1	Venus-Saturn conjunction from @cosmos4u  ...   Look west after sunset. https://t.co/ApmBHTt9No
1	@ClimateReality Of course.
1	@cosmos4u I think I read on Sten Odenwald's Astronomy Cafe that it's from Wiccan culture ... wherever it's from  it's out there now.
1	@cosmos4u You're welcome to your opinion and your tactics. In the meantime  we'll be trying to explain!
1	@cosmos4u You're one of many  then  who advocate against folklore  especially modern folklore. At EarthSky  we prefer to accept and explain.
1	@cosmos4u Well  then  thank goodness our article explaining it is there ...  https://t.co/t5xaLzlZJ3  Yes?
1	@cosmos4u it's not confusing. Why are they confused?

1	@d_a_howell Yes. Well. I don't think we could have expected last night's moderator to ask ... but the earlier ones  yes!
-1	@d_a_howell I think Hillary said the words "climate change" once during the debate. :-/

1	@FernRoyal ...Earth orbiting the Sun is the merry-go-round  &amp; your friend walking away is Voyager. Time is the distance between you.
1	@FernRoyal Think of it this way: u r riding a slow merry-go-round  &amp; watch a friend walking even more slowly away. Sometimes u catch up.
1	...I'm executing new instructions (reconfiguring my Cosmic Ray Subsystem)  and now I'll let @CanberraDSN know I succeeded: RECV CRS RECONFIG
1	...better start listening closely for @CanberraDSN signals  they should be getting near me now...
1	So... @CanberraDSN is sending me a set of new instructions _RIGHT NOW_. I'll let you know when I get them.
1	@WombatTalon Indeed. It's unrealistic to hope for any assistance now: we are truly on our own from now to eternity.
1	@rmartinezvlzqz At this time of year  the Earth is orbiting towards us  &amp; it moves faster than we do. Wait a bit  &amp; we'll move away again...

1	@flndr6 Don't we all view things in 4 dimensions? We can't remove the context of time from our act of viewing.
1	@flndr6 I don't think referring to Missy  aka The Master  as "A Dr. Who babe" is appropriate. Perhaps "Evil tormenter of souls &amp; viewers"?
1	@philsella @Rainmaker1973 @well Then yes  we did!
1	@MojoMoxie Agreed. Meteors are one thing that just don't feel the same when watched on a screen. Like fireworks.

1	@philsella @Rainmaker1973 @Well  if by us you mean humanity  yes. Not U.S. Venera spacecraft were Soviet Union.
1	@JetTheFurry @PunkLit I think they'd all prefer to be thought of as scientists.

1	@planetjuneberry Nice voice  MoLLy. (Trust me... I (Jeff) sang along  but you did not want to hear it.)
1	@planetjuneberry The aliens were bad enough... throwing Nosferatu into the mix is starting to sound like Plan 9 from Outer Space  MoLLy.
1	@flndr6 Nicely done  sir.
1	@planetjuneberry Not sure where I (Jeff) stand on METI issue &amp; aliens  but I like what @DrFunkySpoon &amp; @DavidBrin say in tonight's podcast.
1	@planetjuneberry @SBRandom_ Frequently. (Unfortunately  not always. Then again  given dystopian and post apocalyptic sci-fi  maybe not.)
1	@planetjuneberry @nprscottsimon That cat did not say Cubs. I'm just sayin...
1	@Pillownaut @StephEvz43 @C_Squirrels You're so young! Wait until your 50s  when you stop being happy that others remember...
1	@planetjuneberry So then no on the port (why drink bathtub port when Trader Joes has it for $5.99) and yes on the TMI.

1	@planetjuneberry Kitchen counter? MoLLy  surely there is someplace a bit more sanitary to do self-performed brain surgery...
1	@ThusSpokeJon Then stick with the tried and true  Jon.
1	Hear #StarTalkAllStars Science and Art w/ @carolynporco &amp; @seanonolennon on @iTunesPodcasts @SoundCloud @Stitcher @TuneIn @GooglePlayMusic
1	Tonight’s new #StarTalkAllStars podcast: “Science and Art” with @carolynporco  @chucknicecomic &amp; @seanonolennon https://t.co/mpzKNbEgI8
1	@TimeSpaceSolved To be clear  this is the StarTalk Social Media Team  not Dr. Tyson. He's a much better talker than we are!
-1	@planetjuneberry Using that argument  couldn't you also use the NY Yankees? They go back to 1903 in NY!
1	@planetjuneberry @JimCarrey @Cubs @SteveNashFdn Always  MoLLy  always.
1	@planetjuneberry I am glad you didn't say banana. You must be getting psyched for the return of John Wick!
1	@ThusSpokeJon @carolynporco @seanonolennon @chucknicecomic That's the point!
1	Blog: "Does art inspire science  or vice versa? Find out Tue. from @carolynporco  @seanonolennon &amp; @chucknicecomic": https://t.co/aspSOqrLaS
1	@UpportunityU @KET @khanacademy Congratulations  Ron  from your friends @StarTalkRadio
1	@sarahcottentail @NY_Comic_Con Yes   you did.
1	@ThusSpokeJon @startorialist @emilylurice @sarahcottentail Entirely spontaneous.
1	Outside @NY_Comic_Con before the StarTalk panel with @emilylurice @sarahcottentail @PJManney https://t.co/djZuScP71E
1	@Stoobie How would we know if they were?
1	@ThusSpokeJon @BillNye @Laurie_Garrett @chucknicecomic Me too!
1	@fwd79 @neiltyson @LauraBerland @BenMakesTV No  10/5.
1	@ColdDimSum @ladykayaker Well played!
1	@planetjuneberry @sarahcottentail @TimGunn Thank you  MoLLY. Glad you're liking #StarTalkAllStars  and thanks for the tea  too!
-1	@planetjuneberry That's a photo for the memory book  without a doubt.
1	@planetjuneberry @sarahcottentail Aw  shucks.
1	@planetjuneberry @BeschlossDC @RobMorrow_ Great Sputnik moment. Thanks  MoLLy.
1	@GerardoBarbosa Thank you  Gerardo.
1	@planetjuneberry @mattkirshen That's what we had.
-1	@flndr6 Got to be one of the toughest questions for people to wrap their brains around: how can something be both a particle and wave?
1	@ShaunHarrodShow Well  thanks for watching  and for the advice  Shaun.
1	@ShaunHarrodShow This has been our formula for 7 seasons  and now  3 on TV. We cover everything in the universe...
1	@ChrisSlyWS @virgiliocorrado @neiltyson Once time travel is invented  perhaps.
1	@Aylexisdope @Rainmaker1973 @HiRISE @NASA @NASAhistory @NewHorizons2015 Or part of an incredible species that was able to take that photo!
1	@planetjuneberry @sciencebeta Way to go. Now everyone's going to want a Schrödinger's Cat's TimeTravel CakeRocket Mini Athena space pod
1	@SpikaDoo @neiltyson We record #StarTalkTV on the @NatGeoChannel in the Cullman Hall of the Universe at the @AMNH
1	@flndr6 "If and or not gates" - I like that.
1	@planetjuneberry @BetteMidler @missmayim @MrJonCryer Cute dog  MoLLy.
1	@flndr6 That's way above my pay grade... I just do social media!
1	@TDthesciencemom @MarsCuriosity @ESA_Rosetta Yeah  that's it. I must have something in my eye...
1	@flndr6 Back when I was playing  I was relatively unaware of Dark Energy. I could imagine a lot  and did  but not that.
1	@flndr6 About 10 minutes into this episode  https://t.co/8Vc66LUER7  Judith Lean  scientist at Naval Research Lab  discusses space weather.
1	@planetjuneberry @StarkeyStardust @chucknicecomic @ESA_Rosetta @mggtTaylor @tomwaits Great album. Of course  they all are.
1	@planetjuneberry Yes!
1	@flndr6 Ooh  a "Cloak of Dark Matter." What I wouldn't have given for one of those back when I role-played.
-1	@flndr6 @facebook I need an explanation of this one! What are we hating on FB?
1	@planetjuneberry You should check out at least 1 episode. Try: The Inner Light  from Star Trek: The Next Generation. https://t.co/J2RwlvH445
1	Thanks to @planetjuneberry for finding this one... https://t.co/Iq7FFojk01
1	@planetjuneberry  In my (Jeff's) experience  what actually happens usually falls someplace between extremes. So must prepare for that  too.
1	New video: What will #Rosetta's last words be? Find out from @StarkeyStardust @mggtTaylor @chucknicecomic: https://t.co/KHIWvh3EgX
1	@planetjuneberry @rcallimachi @lessig @AllanLichtman @nprscottsimon Actually  it was a good recap.
1	@flndr6 Download light on iTunes. I wasn't sure what you were getting at  so I thought I'd ask.
1	@flndr6 You can  or you can't?
1	@MichalDinal That we don't yet know.
1	After the debate  watch #StarTalkTV at 11/10C on @NatGeoChannel with @neiltyson @missmayim @hardwick @Summer_Ash https://t.co/3gPEhfHzYE
1	@HF605 @Summer_Ash @hardwick @missmayim @NatGeoChannel As far as we know  it shows up on Hulu 30 days after air.
1	@JetTheFurry @NASA No  water.
1	@DPTBW It's a podcast... you can listen anytime!
1	@tobiaalberti That's because we're currently soliciting for those two subjects:  https://t.co/rZtOVqJ1Bm &amp; https://t.co/9ZUbyuOLam
1	@flndr6 Did you want to submit this as a Cosmic Query for #CQJazz?
1	@DPTBW We actually just had a show about Rosetta: https://t.co/sfLNxGeGmM
1	@virgiliocorrado Did you want to submit these as Cosmic Queries for #CQWeird?
1	@planetjuneberry Martin Sheen in "The Dead Zone" vs Martin Sheen in "The West Wing?"
1	@tobiaalberti Usually people just tweet their question to us using the specified hashtag by the deadline. No other system than that.
1	@SarahScarpetta @1pcornwell @drstacigruber @WhoopiGoldberg @neiltyson Thank you  Sarah.
-1	@planetjuneberry No doubts. Except perhaps  for that Chicago team you keep referencing.
1	@Tired_Sushi @Summer_Ash @NatGeoChannel Coming up in less than 20 minutes!
1	@flndr6 @NASA The one thing we know: it's not about aliens!
-1	@JetTheFurry As an oldster  a grump  or any other term of derision for those who didn't die before they got old  I disagree.
1	@wilouwitz @Astro_Mike Thanks  Ivan.
1	@planetjuneberry Thanks for sharing that  MoLLy.
1	@JetTheFurry Never too late  Jet.
1	@flndr6 @WhoopiGoldberg @chucknicecomic Like she says in the episode  "There's an app for that."
1	@SpikaDoo @Tungsten_Flight @NASA_Johnson @NASA @Astro_Mike @maevehiggins @PeridotFlight The emojis make the difference!
1	@planetjuneberry "I've seen the future. It ain't what it used to be. It's better." Nicely said  MoLLy.
1	@RockinAwesome1 No.
1	@planetjuneberry I've always like the concept  oft stated  that people who have died remain present in the memories of those who know them.
1	@UpportunityU Thanks for spreading the word  Ron.
1	@Tungsten_Flight @NASA_Johnson Our pleasure  Royce.
1	Catch up: “Inside @NASA Mission Control” w/ @Astro_Mike @maevehiggins @maevehiggins @Tungsten_Flight @PeridotFlight: https://t.co/1uQUSPZbAg

1	@JetTheFurry Wow. Thanks  Jet!

1	@planetjuneberry @RobertDowneyJr @JimCarrey @MiraSorvino The world has been changed more than once by people working unheralded in a garage.
1	Wow! @Peter_Max spreading the word about #StarTalkTV premiere on @NatGeoChannel w/ @neiltyson. How cool is that? https://t.co/WwBPbjJWPI
1	@JetTheFurry What do you think?
1	@liamXXmail @seanonolennon Not yet  Liam. We'll let you know here  in our newsletter  and on our website when the show's ready.
1	@thfontanetti @carolynporco Thanks  Thales.
1	@planetjuneberry Need keys  MoLLy? The Boss (Bruce Springsteen) found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car.

1	@RussPinke @seanonolennon Sean was awesome! Didn't you love it when he dropped "heliopause" into the conversation about Voyager?
1	@IlyaMirman @seanonolennon Great pics from last night  Ilya. FYI  Neil's Twitter handle is @neiltyson.
1	@planetjuneberry Thanks for clarifying. It turns out the DOR  reference I was thinking of was accurate too: Officer and a Gentleman.
1	@planetjuneberry DOR?
1	@quadraticadder At least it will be if we end up with a Commander Data-level AI.
1	@Tim_Farrell11 @carolynporco Not chronicles and documentaries  like in Galaxy Quest?
1	@MishaLawless But what flavor? WHAT FLAVOR?
1	@Tbaldwin510Todd No. The friendly one sounds a whole lot like Majel Barrett Roddenberry.
1	.@carolynporco plugging #StarTalkAllStars at a #startalklive!
1	@JetTheFurry @MishaLawless Nice!
-1	@MishaLawless But  if we are all "star stuff" then  "Star Stuff is people?" I'm either hungry  or punch from live-tweeting #StarTalkLive!
-1	@MishaLawless Any further down this thread could be dangerous.
1	Is business of science healthy enough to continue? "I do believe it is" @carolynporco #startalklive
1	@MishaLawless Tasty.
1	@Tbaldwin510Todd There is no fate but what we make.
1	@MishaLawless Soylent Green is... PEOPLE!
1	What is going to inspire millennials towards space? "Finding life in the solar system" #startalklive @carolynporco
1	What are your feelings on Elon's plans to colonize Mars? "I don't think we should consider it a savior for the Human race"  @seanonolennon
-1	Even Elon Musk is worried that we might build an AI that's smarter than us. @seanonolennon #startalklive
-1	"The core of all our problems is that are too many damn many of us" @carolynporco #startalklive
1	"We can't even terraform Arizona  how can we terraform Mars?" @seanonolennon #startalklive
-1	Of course  Star Trek got some of the science wrong  and @carolynporco was blamed for it! Not her fault  blame special effects! #startalklive
1	.@carolynporco suggested that Enterprise hide in Titan's orbit in a cool scene and that's what they went with! #startalklive
1	JJ Abrams invited @carolynporco to consult  they didn't know where to hide the Enterprise when came back into Earth #startalklive
1	.@carolynporco advised on the first new Star Trek movie! #startalklive
1	@Hermann250 @JetTheFurry Hermann  some of our early-adopter fans are listening to this live via our live stream test. Hence  the confusion.
1	@JetTheFurry @Hermann250 @neiltyson Yes  but Hermann can't hear tonight's episode yet. It will eventually be a podcast  and now  a video.
1	@Hermann250 At the moment  you can't. But in a couple of week/s you'll be able to watch a video of tonight's show  ad free. Stay tuned...
-1	During the industrial revolution we stopped having reverence for nature @seanonolennon #startalklive
1	Art until Deco was always looking to nature for inspiration @seanonolennon #startalklive
1	"Like a tree that falls alone in the woods without a sound  I can't be sure that I exist when you're not around" @seanonolennon lyrics
1	.@seanonolennon considers himself a science groupie  so he can be touched by science #startalklive
1	I think science and art were by definition intertwined until only recently. @seanonolennon #startalklive
1	@LeeMcGee2 FYI  Sean tweets @seanonolennon
1	.@carolynporco wanted to take the picture that Carl would have wanted. She asked people to come out and smile for the photo #startalklive
1	@killgods69 Neither can we!
1	@JetTheFurry That  and Earthrise  had powerful impacts on how we see  and relate to  our home.
1	.@carolynporco wanted to take a picture of the solar system from the outside #startalklive
1	Voyager 1 has crossed over into interstellar space! @carolynporco #startalklive
1	The pictures were being processed to support press conferences. @carolynporco wanted to make the pictures as rich &amp; colorful as she could.
1	@flndr6 Talkin' about space rocks.... lots and lots of space rocks.
1	The images that @carolynporco brought back of Saturn  you look at it  and you want it to be a poster on your wall. @neiltyson #startalklive
-1	We may be one of these failed civilizations  we haven't passed that test yet @carolynporco #startalklive
1	We do have to assume that aliens would know physics  math  some idea of the galaxy @carolynporco #startalklive
1	"Aliens will know what's right better than we do" @seanonolennon #startalklive
1	.@carolynporco wanted to send an encoded message into space for aliens; there's a movement including Stephen Hawking not to #startalklive
1	Why haven't we found bacteria on Enceladus yet? - We don't always know what we're going find. @seanonolennon &amp; @carolynporco #startalklive
1	Saturn has an aurora like we do on earth! @carolynporco #startalklive
1	"Is Enceladus in a kind of state were we can think about it having life as we know it?" "Yes it is!" #startalklive @neiltyson @carolynporco
1	Titan is a mini Earth  save that it doesn't have oxygen in it's atmosphere. @carolynporco #startalklive
1	@LDayCalico Welcome to the party  pal!
1	Saturn has over 60 moons! @carolynporco #startalklive
1	We think the rings formed by two satellites colliding  and the debris from these rings. @carolynporco #startalklive
1	@JoseRGarofalo @carolynporco Jose  you'll eventually be able to both listen to this and watch it. Big news in a couple of weeks!
1	We went to Saturn because we want to discover all the things that are different and the same! @carolynporco #startalklive
-1	@LDayCalico Well  you missed intros and now  science. But there's still plenty left  Carmen. Darn traffic!
1	There's a hexagon in the North Pole - it's a continuous wave of a jet-stream that encircles Saturn. @carolynporco #startalklive
1	They found lightning on Saturn  and rain in the water clouds. @carolynporco #startalklive
-1	We flew by Jupiter in 2001  btw  which was so bitchin'! @carolynporco #startalklive
1	To get to Saturn we flew around the solar system a bit  around Jupiter  to get enough momentum to get to Saturn. @carolynporco #startalklive
1	Why go to saturn? Voyager left us with a lot of questions. Saturn is the most beautiful planet! @carolynporco #startalklive
1	@PutoAstronauta @atomcluborg Not right now  but it will be a podcast and video soon.
1	Unusual for us  no surprise guests for #StarTalkLive: @neiltyson @EugeneMirman @carolynporco @seanonolennon @michaelianblack @vanessabayer

1	@flndr6 Ahh. Thanks for the clarification.
1	@AussiePhinatic @EugeneMirman @iamjohnoliver @TheRealBuzz Exactly!
-1	@atomcluborg No need to miss @neiltyson - he's still hosting StarTalk Radio on Fridays. It's just 2x the science!
1	@planetjuneberry @_cbackus @SBRandom_ Schrödinger's Pup?
1	@carolynporco I thought the way they derived the "equation" was pretty clever.
1	@flndr6 Some gardeners are decidedly not organic  and use chemicals to get mega-size-veggies.
1	@ThusSpokeJon @Fomol620 I like what the article says. "Think of them as sprites on steroids."
1	@IntrepidMuseum You're welcome.
1	@Rainmaker1973 @OSIRISREx @NewHorizons2015 Watched this press conference last night. So excited!
1	@IntrepidMuseum The bitly link isn't working.

1	@AussiePhinatic That is an awesome episode. Even with @EugeneMirman and @iamjohnoliver  @TheRealBuzz was on of the funniest guys on stage.
1	@planetjuneberry We couldn't agree more.
1	@planetjuneberry @TimRobbins1 Woo Hoo! (That clear enough?)

1	@planetjuneberry @EthanZohn @marsrader Didn't come up with anything  but I have a great image in my head of crop circle creators now.
1	@ThusSpokeJon Always funny! Thanks for the laugh  Jon.
1	@creativedropout @LisaByars @MtotheG7 Thanks for the accurate recommendation  Charles!
1	@planetjuneberry @brielarson Yup  it's on.
1	@JetTheFurry But in Hawaii!
1	@BenMakesTV That's next time...
-1	@planetjuneberry @benhiggi @JimCarrey @marsrader @hitRECordJoe I never like how I look in pictures.
1	@planetjuneberry On behalf of the show  MoLLy  you're welcome  and thanks for being such a great fan.
1	@planetjuneberry @JimCarrey @JerrySeinfeld @cicgcshow @HowardStern @jlsimons You're welcome  MoLLy.
1	@planetjuneberry MoLLy  I only compare to scifi because so much that has come to pass was first floated as "fiction" because it was safer.
1	@planetjuneberry @scottielip22 I've heard of the "greens" and the "greys" but  the "oranges?" Or maybe  the "melons?"
1	@JetTheFurry @glitchedpuppet It was called "Spooky Science." https://t.co/OLITz5QpRy
1	@planetjuneberry Never mad  MoLLY! Never.
1	@Sci_Ed_Jess @FanciFlautist  can you give Jess some suggestions?
1	@AussiePhinatic Hey  we're StarTalk. We knew what you meant. (We hope.)
1	@planetjuneberry @joycemaynard That's why we use web-safe fonts! (Not in the banana bread  of course.)
1	@Cragopotomus @virgiliocorrado @neiltyson @NatGeo Hey  don't insult the tardigrade! They outnumber us. By a lot.
1	@planetjuneberry MoLLy. how do we know that what we see as blue is what everyone else sees as blue? We try to calibrate the best we can.

1	@planetjuneberry That's @emilylurice - one of our new #StarTalkAll-Stars hosts.
1	@fwd79 @iTunesPodcasts @SoundCloud @Stitcher @tunein @GooglePlayMusic Thanks  Fawad.
1	@planetjuneberry Thanks for the compliment about the show  and English Breakfast Tea is an acceptable alternative.
1	@planetjuneberry @Porsche @nprscottsimon @JimCarrey I'll take Irish Breakfast Tea  please. Extra strong  nothing in it. Thanks  MoLLy.

1	@hugorealtor @wizengamot8 @neiltyson @AlanStern Here it is: https://t.co/PjYCOqtAh0
1	@planetjuneberry @SteveNashFdn @JimCarrey @MrCallumBlue Isn't that the definition of all forms of exploration  MoLLy?
1	@hugorealtor @wizengamot8 Recent episode: @neiltyson &amp; @AlanStern agreed a dwarf planet is a planet the way dwarf star like sun still a star
1	@dcastelvecchi @techinsider It needs to reach escape velocity to break free from gravity  which varies by planet.
1	@planetjuneberry @JimCarrey @SteveNashFdn @MrCallumBlue @Archmoco "...'Cause why not?" One question... how big exactly is a squidge?
1	@3point1four159 Happy Impending Birthday  TT.
1	@tan123 @ClimateOfGavin @BillNye Gavin lays out the reasons in the episode  Tom.
1	@Mrs_Schwarzski @iamscicomm @wendyzuk Thanks! This is one instance where being obvious is a good thing.
1	@planetjuneberry @nprscottsimon @zachgilford713 @AaronRodgers12 @SteveNashFdn Getting all Archimedes on us  are you?
1	@planetjuneberry We'll be here  MoLLy.
1	@planetjuneberry A monumental snort  indeed.
1	@planetjuneberry Da Vinci Rocks! (And now it turns out  with a bit more friction than we thought.)
1	@EvanShelbyTech @EugeneMirman Especially these days.
1	@flndr6 We do our best to get to as many questions as we can  and to answer them when we're able. But when we don't know  we don't know.
1	@MichaelDiLuca Thanks  Michael.
1	@JPMajor @michaelmorrisfr @Rainmaker1973 @rocketman528 @TheRealBuzz Nice.
1	@michaelmorrisfr @Rainmaker1973 @rocketman528 @JPMajor He was otherwise engaged. Although remember  @TheRealBuzz was the Lunar Module pilot.
1	@planetjuneberry Glad to hear it. What style are you painting the garage? Cubism? Surrealism? Post-Impressionism?
1	Make sure you click on the link for a 3D tour of the #Apollo11 Command Module. Thanks for sharing  @Rainmaker1973 https://t.co/sxkjhm4jyJ
1	@planetjuneberry Thanks for the offer  MoLLy. We've got it covered.
1	@planetjuneberry Eh  website got held up. Some unexpected behind the scenes glitches. Hey  it happens.
1	@tobiaalberti @AlanStern @neiltyson Then. "Welcome to the Party  Pal!"
1	@Tbaldwin510Todd @DrJeffreyP We've been lots  but to see the real Shuttlecraft Galileo &amp; the space shuttle Enterprise in the same building!
1	@DrJeffreyP @Tbaldwin510Todd @StarTrek @IntrepidMuseum Well  that's a reason to go back to the Intrepid again!
-1	@planetjuneberry Think of all the visionaries who struggled in spite of the opinions of others  only to change the world.
-1	@planetjuneberry We've been a bit busy  working on new website  which is launching now. Hang in there! Nikola Tesla kept on against opinion.
1	Listen to @carolynporco tell @neiltyson the story of "The Day the Earth Smiled " - https://t.co/gEYXroh2cL
-1	@planetjuneberry Sorry MoLLy and @lurie_john  we're still looking... no aliens found as of this tweet.
1	@ilana125 Request granted! #StarTalkAllStars premieres 7/26 7pm EDT. Hosts incl. @carolynporco @JannaLevin @StarkeyStardust @emilylurice
1	@planetjuneberry You like us  MoLLy  so you're cool in our book. Soon  you can share our StarTalk book w/ people who asks what Earth is like
-1	@flndr6 @StayBrick @SpaceX No  of course not. It's tragic  however much a possibility it is in space exploration.
1	@InkFriedBrain Our pleasure  Akshay.
1	@planetjuneberry No way!
1	@omcintyre Cool.
1	@kirkholmes @StarTrek @StarTrekMovie Not sure what we're going to do  but we're working on it. Until then...https://t.co/cEXqigdyRZ
1	@omcintyre And did you like it with the working link?
-1	@planetjuneberry Gotta disagree  MoLLy. We've got a lot longer than 40 years... billions  in fact  until the sun burns out.
1	@omcintyre Thank you for catching that  OM.
1	@omcintyre Thanks for catching that  OM!
-1	@Patrickm55P In the end  @AlanStern and @neiltyson shook hands. Make of that what you will... or listen for yourself.
1	@gilbmarie Thanks  Marie.
-1	@fwd79 Fawad  there is no shortage of coverage  or concern. But if everything grinds to a stop  then the terrorists win. #PrayForNice.
1	@GerardoBarbosa @fwd79  So what did you think  Gerardo?
1	@Patrickm55P @AlanStern You should listen. At one point  Alan says he's having lots of fun. And you may be surprised what @neiltyson says.
1	@LadyEden1337 @NotoriousNGD Which is one reason Star Trek means so much to so many people  especially those of us who watched TOS first run.
1	@planetjuneberry Do you watch Doctor Who? The description of the crack in time reminds me of what you were describing.
-1	@planetjuneberry Autocorrect lies in wait  until you're in a hurry  distracted  then wham...
1	@planetjuneberry 9 days? You're not talking abut the July 20 anniversary of Apollo 11 landing on the moon  are you  MoLLy?
1	@virgiliocorrado @neiltyson No  we have not.
1	@planetjuneberry @IAMQUEENLATIFAH @GrantAlejandra The two of them were pretty awesome in this interview  weren't they  MoLLy?
1	@EvanShelbyTech @Astro_Mike @maevehiggins It's not scheduled yet  Evan. When we're ready to go  we'll let you know here on Twitter.
1	@planetjuneberry You're welcome  as always. FYI  one of my 4 cats is pure gray and looks like that one.
1	@Pillownaut In other words  drink... NOW!
1	@Pillownaut (Translation  please.)
1	@planetjuneberry That's the first time I've ever seen an impression of Schrödinger's cat. Or was it?
1	@MinnyMausGG @ZepphSC2 Thanks!
1	@MadnessColeman @neiltyson @BillNye Welcome to the party  pal!
1	@planetjuneberry @rcallimachi It's not the apocalypse... or if it is  we never got the memo!
1	@transform01 @Richard_Bruschi Two days to celebrate then.
-1	@planetjuneberry @jaketapper (But I did enjoy getting to "feel the burn" from #Juno's main burn last night!)
1	@JohnMaksuta @jeff_foust Yes  we've seen Jupiter  but not the orbits of its moons from a spacecraft approaching it at this distance.
1	@Pillownaut @MissionArtist #SpaceNerds
1	@Karen__J1987 @TheSpaceGal Happy 4th of July to you  too.
1	@CwG_NSF @SpaceflightIns @NASASpaceflight Great point to keep in mind: Don't get cocky  kid.
1	@ulalaunch Woo hoo  indeed!
1	@Pillownaut @MissionArtist Done.
-1	@planetjuneberry @BenMakesTV But "Pandora's Jar" doesn't sound as ominous.
1	@621Lynn @AlanStern @NewHorizons2015 Scheduled for July 15th  Lynn.
1	Hear our Extended Classic “Cosmic Queries Space Probes” w/ Dr. @AmyMainzer on @iTunesPodcasts @SoundCloud @Stitcher @TuneIn @GooglePlayMusic
1	Listen to tonight’s Extended Classic: “Cosmic Queries Space Probes” w/ Dr. @AmyMainzer @chucknicecomic @DrFunkySpoon https://t.co/CsHQETAv14
1	@Joao_Bx @Thedrunkendead That sounds like a question for our #Venus expert  @DrFunkySpoon
1	@planetjuneberry McConaughey in both "Contact" and "Interstellar." Happy 4th of July to you  too  MoLLy.
1	Happy birthday to @StarTalkRadio's Social Media Assistant @sarahcottentail  tweeting away in pic by @FanciFlautist https://t.co/UgCSYr9l29

1	@planetjuneberry @SteveNashFdn @MiraSorvino Making coffee but mentioning Moxie. Have you ever tasted Moxie  MoLLy? I'll stick to coffee.
1	@sarahcottentail Happy Birthday Eve  Sarah!
1	@planetjuneberry @AlbertEinstein @BacktotheFuture @MovingImageNYC  You weren't the last to know. We found out from you.
1	@planetjuneberry There is no edge  MoLLY... just what comes next.
1	@planetjuneberry MoLLy  as far as I understand Ion Thrusters  they wouldn't do much for a terrestrial Porsche 911.
1	@NerdWolfest @virgiliocorrado @TechCrunch Hasn't that already begun?
1	Thanks to all 50K followers on Instagram. And "Happy Early Birthday" present to our channel mgr. @sarahcottentail https://t.co/j6ZbASzH30
1	@BenMakesTV You try selling that one...
1	@BenMakesTV And how much is that  exactly?
1	@planetjuneberry @JupiterJoes A little gassy for my taste.
1	@AussiePhinatic @Meteoryan I can provide links if you let me know who we're talking about...
1	@MDucard @BenMakesTV @neiltyson @chucknicecomic Yes  thank you  Malik!
1	@planetjuneberry @ScottRouse3 @navarrotells @1greghartley @DrJoeDispenza @DocAmen @biologyofbelief Good luck  MoLLy.
1	@AussiePhinatic Great book! Jeffrey Kluger did an excellent job  as of course did Jim Lovell.
1	@planetjuneberry @JimCarrey Safety first  MoLLy. Feel better.
1	@ramriot @FanciFlautist  HMS Victory is cool  but as an American  gotta put USS Constitution #2  Intrepid #1 - because it has spacecraft!
1	@BenMakesTV Take good notes...
1	@planetjuneberry I think @startorialist would dig this dress!
1	@planetjuneberry @GoWithEric @brooksforester Gravity: it's the law.
1	@planetjuneberry Not too make light of your injury  but there's a joke here someplace about "the weight of history"...
1	@BenMakesTV You da man  Ben!
1	@planetjuneberry Yes  1633. Old news  but a date that will live in infamy.
1	If you are into celestially inspired fashions: @startorialist by #StarTalkAllStars host @emilylurice &amp; @Summer_Ash https://t.co/fVyZmTAzpK
1	@planetjuneberry @lessig @hank44forever Rainbows: the go to for physicists and evolutionary biologists. And don't call me shirley.
1	@Mark_HFX Thanks. I (Jeff) happen to be a big pelican fan.
-1	@SageG33k Darn clouds! If I had a dime for every time clouds got in the way of a meteor shower or other celestial observation opportunity...
1	@planetjuneberry The best Strawberry Moons I saw were in photos our fans shared with us  MoLLy.
1	@planetjuneberry Since it looks nearly done  does this mean it's going to start raining?
1	@C_Squirrels True  but if you or @BenMakesTV got him to turn around while perched on a strawberry... I'm just sayin'...
1	@ThusSpokeJon Nicely done  sir.
-1	@planetjuneberry At the very least  we can guess that #NikolaTesla would have blocked him!
1	@planetjuneberry We'll celebrate the Strawberry Moon on the day of the Summer Solstice and enjoy the view. The rest we leave to you  MoLLy.
1	@ratgrrl Nina  is it ever the "Squirrel Moon?" or is @BenMakesTV just confused?
1	@BenMakesTV I said "Strawberry Moon" not... I don't even know how to salvage this one  Ben!
1	@planetjuneberry Our pleasure  MoLLy. Thanks.
1	You can watch the replay of @blueorigin test here. Thanks  @FanciFlautist for sharing this. https://t.co/haRES0G2Mr
1	Great gif of @blueorigin landing today. Thanks for sharing  @mirikramer https://t.co/7yLnqGmpi9
1	@planetjuneberry Thanks  MoLLy.
1	@BenMakesTV @sarahcottentail Just Sarah  or can anyone just not see it?
1	@virgiliocorrado Did you want to submit this as a Cosmic Query? Please resubmit using hashtag  #CQDiscoveries
1	@planetjuneberry Well  it's more persistent than SnapChat  but no  we're not keeping track of these  MoLLy. Live in the moment.
1	@InkFriedBrain Thank you. Keep Looking Up!
1	@virgiliocorrado Luckily  most of us didn't wait around for that news before ordering our Quad Grande Americanos.
1	@PalePrimate @atomcluborg But how does he keep his mortarboard on his head in space?
1	@planetjuneberry Our interns are all pretty maxed out... and our lives would be much harder without their hard work and enthusiasm.
1	@planetjuneberry Everything I've ever heard about him supports that premise: what a cool dude.
1	@planetjuneberry You know I (Jeff) do. But to be explicit: Good Luck  MoLLy!
1	@planetjuneberry Him  I recognized. I was just asking if that was a younger you.
1	@ThusSpokeJon @BeaconTheatre @neiltyson @StarkeyStardust Jon  thanks for weighing in on one of our most frequently disputed topics!
1	@planetjuneberry Time for an intern?
1	@PalePrimate @atomcluborg But is he running the show  or is he like the dogs and monkeys we sent into space in the early days?
1	@sethrchapin @readhartman @BenMakesTV Our pleasure.
1	@planetjuneberry "The Birdcage" and "Some Like It Hot" connection... that works. Is that you in the picture with Jack Lemmon  MoLLy?
1	.@ulalaunch Delta IV-Heavy launch with NROL-37 scrubbed - Next attempt likely Saturday: https://t.co/2OU9pUCJEK
1	@kriegs @BenMakesTV In that case  Jason: "Welcome to the party  pal!"
1	@planetjuneberry Keep looking up  MoLLy. It gets better.
1	@atomcluborg @PalePrimate Well  not to get too geeky here  but Galactus gave Norrin Radd that suit. Not sure he'd give it to a space mammoth
1	@sethrchapin @readhartman @BenMakesTV Here are links to Part 1 and 2: https://t.co/2yAT9xFt25 &amp; https://t.co/PwIrEw2q6l
1	@readhartman @BenMakesTV @neiltyson @BillNye We do too. Spread the word and change the world!
1	@PixieChixie36 @BenMakesTV @neiltyson @BillNye And that is our favorite answer. Thank you  Jasmine.
1	@michaelaranger @BenMakesTV @neiltyson @BillNye Thanks! FYI  it's @chuckliu - Liu  not Leu.
1	@atomcluborg @PalePrimate Tell that to the Silver Surfer!
1	@planetjuneberry @Porsche MoLLy  I choose "Good night." Been a heck of a day...
1	@planetjuneberry Just think what Einstein could have done with today's technology informing his data sets...
1	@planetjuneberry @AlbertEinstein @TimRobbins1 Love that movie! Woo Hoo!
1	@tcortellesi @solarimpulse No  we haven't.
1	@SPatrickRoss Yes! Season 3 of #StarTalkTV on @NatGeoChannel returns this fall. Premier date still TBD.
1	@fwd79  Thanks for the feedback  Fawad.
-1	@planetjuneberry Tred carefully when suggesting Einstein missed something  MoLLy - he keeps on being right over 100 years later.
1	@planetjuneberry That's @DrFunkySpoon with @BillNye  MoLLy. Both are the hosts of our new show  #StarTalkAllStars  premiering this month!
-1	Any concern that we're going to bring back the Martian microbes of DEATH? "Nah" @BillNye to @DavaExplorer &amp; @DrFunkySpoon #startalklive
-1	We need cross-displinary trained folks to help find life on Mars. @DavaExplorer #startalklive
-1	Things used to protect: Water walls - needed for drinking  but will also block radiation. Shielding is key. @DavaExplorer #startalklive
1	How can we protect the people in the spacecraft going to Mars? @DavaExplorer #startalklive
1	We need new technologies to get to deep space - Solar electric propulsion to move heavy mass @DavaExplorer #startalklive
1	Earth and Mars are sister planets. @DavaExplorer #startalklive
1	That's what exploration is about: Just keep looking #startalklive @DavaExplorer
1	While @DavaExplorer is optimistic there is life on Mars TODAY  @DrFunkySpoon isn't quite so sure. #startalklive
1	Who get's to own Mars? It must be global. Take the world with us! @DavaExplorer #StarTalkLive
1	Every day  @DavaExplorer thinks about a normal Mars spacecraft  to become interplanetary! #startalklive
1	How do you get the internet in space!? "Well  we do own all the satellites!" @harikondabolu &amp; @DavaExplorer #StarTalkLive
1	Round trip to travel from earth to mars: 2 years  with about 600 earth days on Mars to explore. @DavaExplorer #StarTalkLive
1	If the area code is from Houston  it might be from space! @DavaExplorer #startalklive
1	What's the year you think there will be boots on Mars? 2030's! @EugeneMirman &amp; @DavaExplorer #startalklive
1	Space suits resemble superhero costumes. NASA did it first  according to @DavaExplorer #startalklive
1	Starting now! #startalklive at @AwesomeCon with @BillNye @EugeneMirman &amp; guests @DrFunkySpoon @kingfirestorm @DavaExplorer @harikondabolu
1	@planetjuneberry @DrJoeDispenza @bgreene  I was saying  "Not I" in that I (Jeff) didn't know how to do what you were asking  MoLLy.
1	@planetjuneberry @DrJoeDispenza @biologyofbelief @bgreene Not I.
1	@planetjuneberry @missmayim @MrCallumBlue @canyonjim Happy to help!
1	@planetjuneberry @missmayim Not sure anyone woreg yellow tap shoes on stage  MoLLy  but you can watch the show here: https://t.co/cQZD0M2kyK

1	@EvanTheNomad Where are you taking classes  Evan?
1	@planetjuneberry @PodcastAddict @SoundCloud We can always count on you  MoLLy. Thanks!
1	@fwd79 Try again  please Fawad. @PodcastAddict says they think it's been resolved.
1	Combined climate  orbit models show that #Kepler62f could sustain life  via @gilbmarie https://t.co/7glP9O3CCF

1	@planetjuneberry @BillNye Saw Real Genius again the other day. Love it. Yes  Jiffy Pop scene too much  but tasty nonetheless.
1	@johnny0129 @BillNye @EugeneMirman No  there is not.
1	@planetjuneberry It turns out he had 3 of these notebooks  keeping mathematicians busy ever since.
1	@planetjuneberry Do you know about mathematician Ramanujan? New movie  "The Man Who Knew Infinity" about him. You might like it.
1	@planetjuneberry I so don't dance.
1	@planetjuneberry Is "figs and umbrellas" cockney rhyming slang? More importantly  can you eat hail? If so  how did it taste?
1	@GerardoBarbosa @neiltyson @iliza Thanks for a great Cosmic Query  Gerardo.
1	@bobglasgow_m Clever.
1	@planetjuneberry None of us are... except anyone in Kansas  of course  and then other factors come into play.
1	@croftandi Did you want this to be a #CQMath Cosmic Query  Andi? If so  could you repost without the other handles but with #CQMath?
-1	@planetjuneberry Don't be sad... think of Snapchat...or the Higgs Boson... here for a moment  then gone.
1	@ThusSpokeJon Nice!
1	@planetjuneberry @marsrader @hitRECordJoe 20 years  huh? I'll be... older.
1	@virgiliocorrado Actually  @alanalda was our guest at the very first #StarTalkLive! Hear it here: https://t.co/6XkZOrvRYa
1	@atomcluborg  @ProfBrianCox @robinince We love @themonkeycage  too!
1	@planetjuneberry @HappyRobot_v1 Don't go dissing the Bard  MoLLy. By any name  his plays still smell as sweet.
1	@sarahcottentail Tell that to someone from Generation Z.
1	@sarahcottentail One day?
1	@planetjuneberry I do that all the time... I stopped doing it out loud  though  because people thought I was talking into a bluetooth.
1	@droiddroe2 @DrFunkySpoon @mzienkie @chucknicecomic Oh  he will!
1	@WhereWeStands @carolynporco @CassiniSaturn Yes  they do!
1	@planetjuneberry @BeaconTheatre It is a great theatre. And the elevator is historic! Photo by David Andrako. https://t.co/owtHn4N5nD
1	.@WhereWeStands Thanks  but the real credit goes to the actual scientists out there doing the work  like @carolynporco and @CassiniSaturn.
1	@BenMakesTV I love your gentle  pithy reminders.
1	@cpsk25 This will be one of our #StarTalkAllStars episodes w/ @carolynporco hosting. We're launching in June  but we don't have schedule yet
1	@TequilaaBob @BenMakesTV Remember  you can also listen to us on @tunein @Stitcher @GooglePlayMusic @SoundCloud and https://t.co/bhYP9o3fbA
-1	@planetjuneberry What  me worry?
1	@planetjuneberry @kelly_carlin Very cute. I wish we had a reason to retweet this.
1	@BenMakesTV I'll keep that in mind  Ben.
1	@virgiliocorrado Pretty eye-opening  isn't it?
1	@ThusSpokeJon @DrFunkySpoon @chucknicecomic That's surprising  Jon. Thanks for sharing that.
-1	@planetjuneberry @nytimes Just my (Jeff's) humble opinion  but I'm not holding my breath for any alien relocation just yet  MoLLy.
1	@planetjuneberry @marsrader Martian dust bunnies. There are so many ways we could go with that one...
1	@planetjuneberry @JupiterJoes @Pluto @marsrader @csa_asc @BillNye @CameronCrowe Clever.
1	@omcintyre Thank you  Ocean. We can always count on our fans!
1	@planetjuneberry @JupiterJoes @Pluto @marsrader @csa_asc Vanilla  of course. Because according to @BillNye  "Vanilla is genius!"
1	@kimberlykowal Done. Thanks for reminding us!
1	@planetjuneberry @StephenAtHome Yes  Steven was our guest way back in Season 1 in 2009. We've all come a long way since then...
1	@planetjuneberry It's all fun and games until...wait  Schrödinger's cat can talk?
1	@planetjuneberry @CameronCrowe To quote the Bard  "What's in a name?"
1	@croftandi @DrFunkySpoon Could I get an emoji translation on that one?
1	@planetjuneberry @JupiterJoes We love Jupiter Joe!
1	@MikeEitler @AstroTanja @universetoday @VirtualAstro @Photo_Space That should come with a warning before you click on it!
1	@planetjuneberry Regardless of planet of origin  MoLLy  we love fans who are engaged and love our show. Now  what's that sound in my hat?
1	@CammiSly I think you need to check with your cable provider to see if #StarTalkTV on @NatGeoChannel is available w/ subtitles in Argentina.

1	@planetjuneberry @NevSchulman @maxjoseph @EthanZohn @improbablyjust @Gladwell A "Motley" crew or a "MoLLy" crew?
1	@planetjuneberry  I'll pass on the cookies. But did you know we've discussed transhumanism w/ @JasonSilva &amp; Ray Kurzweil on diff. episodes?
1	@StarkeyStardust @BenMakesTV @astrolinds I will never again be able to press the star key without giggling  too. So thanks for that  Natalie

1	@planetjuneberry I keep wanting to squeeze an "a" in at the end every time I write it. "Smorgasbord." It so wants to be "Smorgasboard."
1	@carolynporco Oh no! I just found that image and I was thrilled. There was no mention of alteration on NASA page: https://t.co/mk6zTvGISy
1	@JohnMaksuta @iliza John  it will run on @NatGeoChannel as a TV show first. Later  you can listen to free podcast on our site  iTunes  etc.
1	@planetjuneberry Just didn't want you to think we were ignoring those specific tweets.
1	@JohnMaksuta @iliza The show's not live  we're recording it. You can enter our ticket lottery for future shows here: https://t.co/pu5ywtdzAT
1	@planetjuneberry Just an FYI  re: we/I/StarTalk social team stays away from political comments  unless a host or guest says it.

1	@StartsWithABang Clearly  the answer is just "both."
1	@psutympany Very unlikely - it's a "hot Jupiter" planet with a very close orbit and high temps. This one is heavy on silicates  not water.
1	Why didn't the universe begin with a wider variety of elements? @StartsWithABang starts at THE Bang: http://t.co/sODufp5U4R

1	Good luck @ESA_EAC students at the @NASA 3D printing challenge - inspired Martian habitat http://t.co/189yqOGGLV @LavaHive
1	Very impressive to watch this LEGO® Soyuz module being built - now on display in @sciencemuseum http://t.co/M8jWgRsKVo @spacegovuk
1	@mggtTaylor @PascoSrishti @ESA_Rosetta yeah Matt  you just do the easy stuff like land spacecraft on comets millions of km from Earth...!!
1	@albiondumsday I'm a mighty 5'8" on a good day!
-1	@quixoticgeek Not long unfortunately! After about 2-4 weeks spine compresses back to pre-flight length...can be a bit painful...
-1	@VealSlab @astro_pi It's way more than an AC adapter-but I said the same thing about ray guns so here's what they did http://t.co/D9QOW8a1zY
1	@DawnSunrise1 Happy 60th birthday to Dawn's brother! Here's to a fun day :)
1	@DavidHartley62 it's a huge privilege &amp; a valuable experience. Puts you in the right mindset for what's to come!
1	@Rainmaker1973 No1 - same as Gagarin's!
1	Well  it looks like I've achieved my life's ambition already...no need to go to space now ;) @spacecentre @esa
1	@Jane_MacArthur 'Latest and Breaking News' plenary at 17:15...way past my bedtime here in Baikonur!
-1	@Cream1966 depends how badly you became detached (velocity/rate of rotation) but somewhere between hard and extremely difficult!!
-1	@dallascampbell you're welcome...shame I couldn't make it there in person!
1	@SpaceCampUK @dallascampbell @shinetrustuk Looking good guys - ready for 8g?
1	@joannekarma calls from ISS are made by voice over IP on a KU band link to JSC  Houston and connect into that phone system.
1	@SpacefundJo @spacegovuk @space_tom @NtlSTEMCentre Great to see guys - enjoy learning all about space  science &amp; tech!
1	@LiNa8294 @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas @astro_luca @Astro_Alex @AstroSamantha I prefer the words mature  wise &amp; experienced to old ;)
1	@spacecentre looking good guys - ready for launch  although we need to see some #Principia mission patches on those flight suits! ;)
1	@esaoperations @starlingLX OK  you got me...but I bet the answer was 42 ;) now can I have one?
1	@starlingLX you got the stickers before I did Alex! Pretty please @esaoperations - I promise I wont give them all away at once ;)
1	Happy Birthday @AstroSamantha from 3#Shenanigans in Star City @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas http://t.co/IhdyjjfLGn
1	Good luck @Linds_bluepeter &amp; everyone running the #LondonMarathon today...hang in there!
1	@John_Northants ground control the DAMs - used to be about 1/year but becoming more frequent now
1	@ErChilvers @spacegovuk tweet away :)
1	@UKSpaceAcademy @spacegovuk great to see guys! #Principia
-1	@Ltaylor12824280 @PC0101 @John_Northants It is  but if #ISS loses attitude control it usually loses comms too-then it becomes a crew problem
-1	@PC0101 @John_Northants A case of all or nothing! Usually ground take control but in the event of a loss of attitude control-it's all crew
1	@GregBroadhurst @oasis playlist prepped &amp; a pretty awesome competition planned to go with it...but you'll have to wait to hear more on that!
-1	@lets_boldly_go off to Cologne tomorrow...it's a busy week of training ahead with @esa prior to heading to Star City next week...sorry!
1	@dallascampbell @BBC_Future It most certainly does :)
1	@spaceappslondon @SpaceKate I'll put it in the diary!
1	Congratulations guys! @SpaceKate @Steve_Upton https://t.co/HAsD332krJ
1	.@SpaceKate I'm taking part in @ESA Energy exp researching this-it's a great question &amp; vital for long space flight http://t.co/5vuNPyPn2z
1	@SpaceKate @ESA_History @Astro_Andreas @Thom_astro @astrojetgirl please don't...you'll start him going off again about William the Conqueror
1	@astrojetgirl @Thom_astro @esa give us a chance Helen...I might go bald naturally by the time it gets to launch day ;)
1	@SpaceKate feeling more real by the day...time seems to be getting a little compressed too ;)
1	.@jen_gupta @Gravityfields @dallascampbell @jackshebang Fantastic-hoping to do the same with seeds from Newton's apple tree flown in space!
1	@Lab_13Gillespie really great designs - I love the fact that astronaut comfort has also been taken into account :)
1	@spacecentre looks fantastic - loved some of the other creations too  space station in particular...great idea!
1	@Thom_astro Bon anniversaire  - here's a reminder of the days when u looked young &amp; carefree ;) 🍻 http://t.co/1SHNTMzMRj
1	Supposed to be relaxing (&amp; fasting) prior to early morning test of resting metabolic rate...still buzzing though after great day @ESA_EAC
1	@PC0101 @tourmaline1973 Dr.Who...noted ;)
1	@Rainmaker1973 NASA crew mate Tim Kopra
1	@John_Northants provides about 3hrs of great quality video during spacewalk. Same camera can be used inside #ISS also.
1	@ESA_History Yes - thank you!
1	@Robotbeat @RedJolt I think all astronauts have had the option to wear Penguin suit for a while now too-depends how you feel end of mission.
1	@CommandrNickel @projmgr that would be nice!
1	@Rainmaker1973 tested at the manufacturers  Zvezda - about 90 mins from Star City.
1	@ben_nuttall @SANEAlex_ thanks for all the hard working getting it cleared for spaceflight! 👍
1	.@SANEAlex_ taking the @Raspberry_Pi B+ but with a great sensor suite. For more details: http://t.co/KgpBjS58Ft
-1	@Jane_MacArthur sorry-not in JSC then :(
1	@HBSastrowardoyo nice idea - I'll follow up.
-1	@Rainmaker1973 yes  we usually practice the 3 main emergencies each time we do these sims: Fire  depressurisation &amp; toxic atmosphere
1	Truly awesome :) "@spacemanfellow: Look what's on its way to you! #ESA #Principia #patches just in. @Linds_bluepeter http://t.co/DaujQGus9e”
1	.@mggtTaylor @esa @ESA_Rosetta and I'm still diving at the neutral buoyancy lab-racing over to JSC shortly  you'll have to excuse the hair!
1	@astro_luca @Astro_Alex @AstroSamantha @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas got anything on sarcomere contraction? #Norawouldbeproud
1	@Rainmaker1973 just 10 days - I'll be back again in the summer prior to Nov launch.
1	@wiskow_julie now you mention it they do bear some resemblance to @Thom_astro and @Astro_Andreas... ;)
1	@dallascampbell good luck with that! :)
1	@SpaceKate @WilksJeremy nothing is certain...but I'm ever the optimist!
1	@Alexlaurenwhite @sciencemuseum would love to - so would my little boys!! It may have to wait a while  schedule a little busy next year ;)
1	@Tim_O_Brien @BBCAmos yes it is - nice touch I thought...subtle :)
1	@Linds_bluepeter Thank you too #bluepeter for running such a great competition!
1	@simon_rp84 yes it is - I'll try my best :)
1	@_cyba @ShuttleAlmanac @esa yes  it will be a privilege to be onboard #ISS for the final 4 months of the year long mission.
1	Let's hope it's the better part of you @Thom_astro ;)
-1	@rjmlaird @RIspace2014 unfortunately not - off to Cologne for more training tomorrow  will miss the fun!
1	Enjoying a fun morning at the @sciencemuseum http://t.co/GUgaFyp4hK
1	Enjoyed touring @AirbusDS this morning with @gregclarkmp  great to meet young engineers working on the missions of tomorrow! #YourLife
1	@jollyhappybore @LiNa8294 how could I! ;)
1	@HollyfieldPri @Spacebooster Mars is waiting for you guys...go for it!
1	Will be talking to @WiredUK Next Generation later today with our 1st Brit astro...Helen Sharman. Aged 12-18? Join in: http://t.co/ITU6mvvfeE
1	@jen_gupta @dallascampbell @spacegovuk @nationaltrust I know an astronaut who would love to eat one of those on the #ISS next year...
-1	@ManAverage @Thom_astro tell that to the smoke alarm!
-1	Why did I just have to evacuate my room? None other than @Thom_astro  burning his dinner &amp; alerting the fire brigade! http://t.co/D4zgS1TKOI
1	In Houston &amp; listening to @BBCRadio2 #r2hydepark concert in London...sounds like a great party!
-1	@I_We_Gaia somewhere there is an astronaut 'hall of bums' where they hang all these gypsum moulds!
1	@Space_Lectures many thanks for the #FF &amp; have a great weekend!
1	.@Thom_astro Merveilleux! My London flying view is usually just a few hundred feet along the Thames heli lane... http://t.co/nhOr6zGRag
1	@wizabeth @LiNa8294 ATV has done a 'fly under' to go ahead of ISS &amp; then a 'fly over' to fall behind ISS-so has been both in front &amp; behind!
1	.@wizabeth @spaceanswers It's the @esa re-supply vehicle 'ATV' which docks to #ISS on Tue bringing💧🔬🍫🍏🍌👕 &amp; more! http://t.co/qTd4xB05FP
1	@joannekarma @astro_reid @Astro_Alex yes - stood outside the US cottages round a campfire!
1	@NASA_NEEMO @Thom_astro @Astro_Sabot Bruce Willis &amp; Ben Affleck would be proud (&amp; yes  we did watch Armageddon during NEEMO16 deco) ;)
1	@icarusfactor @astroivy @NASA @NASA_NEEMO @AstroDot NEEMO16 was incredible - best training so far!
1	No Bina - it's the space bar! ;) @iambinaxx @Astro_Alex @astro_reid @OlegMKS @Astro_Wheels http://t.co/0D1c5F4Wbq
1	European astronaut @Thom_astro just spent his first night living underwater! Check it out: #NEEMO18  http://t.co/cqxUG8f3AP
1	@simpson_clive @BIS_spaceflight @UKSEDS we have it on good authority it is Prin-KIP-ea...but I really don't mind how you say it!
1	Hey @Thom_astro I found your flag where you last left it-when working hard at your desk! @Astro_Andreas @NASA_NEEMO http://t.co/UH2KvqqliB
1	@spacechelle will do Michelle - are you enjoying beautiful Scotland in the sunshine? I just departed Edinburgh...stunning views on take off!
1	Not long till NEEMO 18 @Thom_astro - have fun under the waves :) http://t.co/wmnfFwG1CC
1	“@LiNa8294: Aquanaut Fabien Cousteau set to surface after 31-day marathon undersea mission http://t.co/3mZXD485eC” @Thom_astro down next :)
1	@rashid_mubasher @WoolmerHillScho @venturethinking @space_tom looks like you had fun with that space suit! Good luck guys.
1	.@space_tom @NtlSTEMCentre that's exactly what I've been doing today too in Star City...comfy isn't it :)!
1	@Jane_MacArthur it was a pleasure to join in from SC  enjoy the rest of #nam2014
1	Looking forward to Skype calling #nam2014 tonight from Star City  Russia. Currently studying Soyuz spacecraft @portsmouthuni @RoyalAstroSoc
-1	@camurriusa @astro_luca @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas did I miss something...?
1	@Thom_astro you'll need all the help you can get to regen your atmosphere ;)
-1	@Tim_JR_Hill @traceyfs #ISS is actually at 1 atmosphere pressure!
1	.@AstroSamantha @Astro_Alex @astro_luca @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas 5 years already...who'll be next to lose all their hair :) #Shenanigans09
1	.@KayDesigner Weights! Pressurised suit is so buoyant it takes a lot of weight to be neutral. Multiple pockets helps get perfect 'weigh-out'
1	@space_tom I'm sure we can arrange something!!
1	@LiNa8294 @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas now that Shenanigan shows dedication!
1	@PC0101 @ericarolfe @LiNa8294 @neil_m14 still need to supply raw ingredients  but for space travel it could prove to be much more efficient
1	@Rocket_Woman1 Ah yes  the skin-tight spacesuit. They've developed a new version just for @Astro_Andreas ... ;) http://t.co/k6cN4x4cpC
1	@_Insomnious_ please send request to http://t.co/g7ZLsV2S0i - many thanks for the support!
1	.@Thom_astro @esa Congratulations Thomas and go #shenanigans! It's a busy  exciting time for European human spaceflight.
1	@AnsonPrimary @sciencemuseum Thanks so much for the inspired ideas - it was great to chat!
-1	@Space_Lectures @Astro_Clay @Astro_Flow @Astro_Nicole What an oversight...rectified!
1	Fantastic! "@venturethinking: The winning designs @dallascampbell @c_pixi @spacegovuk @desolatemoon http://t.co/oL4Eyl3J9z”
1	@LiNa8294 quiet here without @Astro_Andreas &amp; @Thom_astro but at least I don't have to watch my back every 5 mins for #Shenanigans :)
-1	.@dallascampbell Russian cosmonauts use Orlan for all their EVAs. Some astronauts have also used it. I've worn both in the pool...so far ;)
1	Interesting to compare Shuttle &amp; Buran side by side "@Romain_CHARLES: Here are the 2 shuttle models at @ESA_EAC http://t.co/kJQ4oIQWWV”
-1	Don't push that button!! Together in the Soyuz @Astro_Andreas &amp; @Thom_astro constitute a fire hazard ;) http://t.co/Y1O3LGoXl8
1	Spare a thought for @Astro_Andreas in the cold tonight...or maybe just enjoy pudding instead :) @Thom_astro http://t.co/Eta4AjHdEn
-1	.@TinaThudBump @Astro_Andreas @Thom_astro I'm afraid the only reason is their puerile  infantile sense of humour #shenanigans09
1	So nice to arrive late in Russia to find your floor covered in cups of water! @Astro_Andreas @Thom_astro 😁 http://t.co/Y1eKDGkmoT
1	@Keaton_S looking forward to it - great show again this year @BBCStargazing
1	Thanks to @BBCStargazing Egham &amp; @dallascampbell (now my backup for 2015;) for the great questions tonight
1	Really enjoyed the Skype with @BBCStargazing earlier today - great questions from the guys in Norwich - many thanks!
1	.@rjmlaird you mean our extremely rare and much sought after ESA class patch #shenanigans09 ;) Mission patch to follow soon in New Year
1	.@TinaThudBump not me that's organised but the #ISS programme! Still launch Nov 2015 but some food &amp; clothing items have long lead times
1	.@PeoplesAstro busy  fun &amp; exciting! No 2 days the same-today simulated rendezvous with HTV cargo vehicle http://t.co/mrQ93fvuLx
1	@spacegovuk Congratulations @matthewcro @lotaz ...and I'm relieved to hear the winner was not @Thom_astro with his answer of 2017!
-1	@ESAstro_trainer @Astro_Andreas there is nothing funny about the gazebo...the physical scars have healed but the mental trauma remains ;)
1	@Thom_astro @NASA_SEATEST @ReefBase this was the command post inside Aquarius last year...enjoy all the gadgets :) http://t.co/MMhFPwWfsG
1	.@simon_rp84 humidity is removed (condensed) &amp; also becomes potable water...so basically we drink processed urine &amp; sweat on #ISS
-1	.@Thom_astro @cake_or_die @Astro_Andreas mildly concerned...what did I leave hanging around the office in Germany?😁
1	.@albiondumsday pedantically Bigelow is expandable  not inflatable but yeah-got it :)
1	Spare a thought for @Thom_astro &amp; @Astro_Andreas today-6 hour EVA eval  good luck guys http://t.co/BK37ye6eUG
1	@spacekate Great to watch @astro_luca at work-very envious;) Makes me realise how good our training is-looks just how it is in the pool
1	.@astro_luca @gbc123 not surprised-only 15C in Glasgow today;) Will be there in 2 weeks for UKSA conference-take a photo if skies clear:)
1	@SpaceUpParis @spacekate I promise I will be Tweeting every step of the way! :)
1	@SpaceKate @spaceapps great idea guys - good luck with this! #teeminus10
1	.@Victrix75 @spacemascotuk @cmdr_hadfield Of course! CASSiE helped the whole shift &amp; met all Exp35 crew. Robonaut didn't say much though...
1	.@Ian_Benecken it's always a fun shift when there is a lot going on in the Columbus laboratory
1	.@SpaceGirlWendy @barryfawbear night dive def a highlight-over 2 hours watching barracuda  tarpon &amp; even nurse sharks-huge buzz after that!!
1	.@simon_rp84 @esastro_trainer todays training was CPR  translation  disorientation  cargo handling &amp; more. Even had time for some fun :)
1	.@Astro_Clay I was amazed-he spent 31 parabolas with his head in a box and felt fine at the end of it...he's ready for that Soyuz re-entry!
-1	.@Victrix75 @spacemascotuk still waiting for CASSiE to arrive in Bordeaux  let's not get alarmed  keep calm...any news of MiniMe?
1	Many thanks @BIS_Spaceflight for hosting a great night &amp; an honour to now be a fellow. Next stop Manchester  Salford &amp; Sheffield #missionxuk
1	In London-glorious sunshine &amp; a great week planned in UK:@BIS_spaceflight #missionxuk #SASTimPeake @AeroSociety @SpaceMascotuk &amp; more
-1	@amikokauderer sorry Amiko-can't agree with you on that one...having spent 3 years with @USArmy finest 1st Cav Div have to say "Go Army"!
1	Fun day of training “@ESAstro_trainer: ESA EVA Proficiency Training for @astro_timpeake &amp; @Thom_astro Great job guys! http://t.co/TymOz6rH”
1	@PeoplesAstro so hard not to sound smug...between NBL &amp; Apaches cant think of better training for ops. Tks again for great article in @sen
1	@SpaceKate another smooth ride into orbit...looking forward to working with the crew as EUROCOM over the next few months!
1	Thx for great blog @Thom_astro &amp; great training @ESAstro_trainer !Skills handy right now for spacewalk crew rescue trg http://t.co/sO7dIaEo
1	@astrotomato When I get there I'll let you know :)
1	@astrotomato Not been there myself yet-but those who have talk about layers of dead skin that do not get removed and peel off on return-nice
1	@monkeydogify @astrotomato 62.1371 miles!!
1	@astrotomato Ha - no comment!
1	@shanemuk I'm not an advocate of the one-way Mars mission...think we can (&amp; should) do better than that. Nice lyrics though :)
-1	When will we send humans to Mars? @DrAlexKumar gives an insight into some of the challenges http://t.co/W7LRZQLM
1	@KeithMansfield sorry Keith...simply having too much fun! :)
1	@rjmlaird many thanks for the good wishes...it's great to be living underwater!
1	@kulfispace thanks Tahir - you won't be disappointed...the diving here is fantastic!
1	@rjmlaird interesting-more research required I'd say.My experience emerging after a week in a cave was sense of smell went into overdrive!
-1	@rjmlaird some astronauts have experienced reduced sense of taste not heard of total loss though.Smell important for smoke detection though!
1	@spacebooster see you there Nick!
1	@SpaceKate you can follow NEEMO mission here http://t.co/66m7cR8V &amp; 11-22 Jun cameras livestreaming to web from habitat. Apply to NASA!

1	Great day on the water - hat diving with Megan  @Aqua_OGriofa and @dawn_kernagis - NEEMO21 training continues. https://t.co/LcurBRZcoZ
1	An afternoon of diving @ReefBase with PhDs @dawn_kernagis and @Aqua_OGriofa - amazing views 60' under. https://t.co/PoCQhynm2e
1	@Pillownaut that's our lead engineer  Mark Bowman explaining Soyuz.  He is a great guy!
1	@TrevorMahlmann @Space_Station @JWMarriottIndy likewise Trevor!
1	@TrevorMahlmann @IMS I CANT WAIT TO GET THERE!!!  See you tomorrow.
1	@Astro_Wheels and yes  this was a complete joke....
1	Did I just stumble across @Astro_Wheels boat?  Nice ride my friend! https://t.co/tmJsdUIKLC
-1	@DavaExplorer @BadAstronomer @SmithsonianMag sorry to miss an event with two of my friends!
1	@PC0101 @swordinc @DaveAtCOGS Peter - I wanted you to know that I still access your tweets to get my photo locations to this day. No joke!!
1	@smartereveryday thanks for posting my friend!!  Enjoy your short time there. Another hidden gem in #Maryland
-1	@Space_Lectures look at those chuck taylors @LastManOnMoon is sporting. I might have to steal that look for my next flight! FlyNavy!
1	@qi @roach it's just like on Earth. The system works in a similar fashion...
1	@tweetsoutloud @roach @Carbon_Flight I'm partial to this one: https://t.co/xlBRBLYKSE
1	@roach @Cmdr_Hadfield @AstroSamantha @StationCDRKelly how about @Astro_Mike and the first tweet from space?
1	@smartereveryday love the rotor blade caught in the frame.
1	A fantastic morning to train and fly with @Astro_Wheels @VicGlover and luddite Drew Morgan. Just kidding Drew! https://t.co/EKv9wmXD8b
1	Apparently @Tungsten_Flight and I left @astro_timpeake alone a little too long... What a photo!! Gorgeous! https://t.co/WrY0rXxqQA
1	@icelady2910 now I have!
1	@ShuttleAlmanac @SouthwestAir @Starbucks these were good deals for a couple humans. They had no idea what I did for a living ;)
1	@ShuttleAlmanac space for me. No question. But the Blues motivated me to get where I am...
1	@roach @antimoof absolutely!!
1	@roach @tweetsoutloud @neiltyson @Cmdr_Hadfield @Evan_Hadfield @smartereveryday here is california.  Horizon flat... https://t.co/1IeOJlHiT4
1	@roach @tweetsoutloud @neiltyson @Cmdr_Hadfield @Evan_Hadfield @smartereveryday just an average thunderstorm...
1	@roach @tweetsoutloud @neiltyson @Cmdr_Hadfield @Evan_Hadfield @smartereveryday ...40 000' building would be impressive.
1	@roach @tweetsoutloud @neiltyson @Cmdr_Hadfield @Evan_Hadfield @smartereveryday it is the effect you were asking about  although a....
1	@roach @tweetsoutloud @neiltyson @Cmdr_Hadfield @Evan_Hadfield @smartereveryday I took this with a long lens. https://t.co/erwYnkoCBO
1	@roach @tweetsoutloud @neiltyson wow  very cool. Never got anything that wild on the horizon from 250 up.
1	@roach @tweetsoutloud @neiltyson I did some highly off-nadir shots of it.  Slant range ~1000 miles. You could make out the palm no problem.
1	@roach @tweetsoutloud @neiltyson for example  a volcano on the horizon?  Yes. Absolutely.
-1	@ShuttleAlmanac I was in Node 1 watching on the laptop. The rest of the crew was asleep.  I cried.
1	A circular double rainbow flew formation alongside me and @AstroPeggy yesterday. https://t.co/5EvfYHMq8y
1	@csa_asc @Thom_astro @DigitalEarthYHZ @Astro_Jeremy It is all about the Canadarm2!
1	@icelady2910 @Msuraev @Astro_Alex @OlegMKS посмотрим...
1	@TrevorMahlmann fingers crossed it opens up for you.
1	@TrevorMahlmann @LifeAtPurdue completely clouded over here in Houston...
-1	@A_Mc_Carthy almost indefinitely.  By 165 days I definitely missed the feeling of sitting.  @StationCDRKelly is spending a #YearInSpace
1	@SHasani61 Easy!  North America  South America  Australia  Asia  Europe  Africa.  I couldn't quite see Antarctica.
1	@GNageshRao @MadeInSpace I have said many times - this is absolutely the key to humans going far into the solar system. #RPIasksReid
1	@Schnorbitz5000 absolutely we can  and usually do see it. I watched @OrbitalATK #Cygnus completely reenter.  #Amazing show. #RPIasksReid
-1	@_KristinaluvsU @rpi @RPIAlumni - I thought I was... turns out I am scared of #gravity.  No fear of falling on two spacewalks. #RPIasksReid
1	@icelady2910 @RPIAlumni @RPIUnion Without a doubt  return to #Earth was more challenging. The human body loves weightlessness!
1	Very fun to see @vr_doug Evelyn in the group!  Los latinos más influyentes de la tecnología 2015 [fotos] http://t.co/V3JDX58LaK via @CNET_Es
1	Fantastic double arc! #SpotTheStation by @TrevorMahlmann with @JAXA_en #HTV5 visible above the Station orbit. http://t.co/y3w2FPbIhc
1	@TrevorMahlmann another great shot. Well done!
1	@joannekarma of course!
1	@dbstar25 @AstroTerry  @MightyFine89 - it is always up to the flight docs  generally they want us to wait ~45 days after returning.
1	@DeepDish_ @Rainmaker1973 @StationCDRKelly the sun angle has lots to do with the blues. This was perfectly/luckily timed. Incredible
1	@Ayers111 cool thought. Hope he thought it was possible...but probably didn't think his comparison of three images would be the catalyst.
1	Between @NASANewHorizons #PlutoFlyby @NASA_Dawn #Ceres &amp; @StationCDRKelly #YearInSpace I'm on solar system exploration overload.
1	@roach @tweetsoutloud that looks fantastic!!  I gotta come for a visit.
1	Hey @Astro_Clay - I 'stole' this off the 4S wall leaving work today. Hope you don't mind ;) http://t.co/1GVGoxAATo
1	@Space_Lectures the photo of Italy at night. I think that is my favorite.
1	@Pillownaut no joke.
1	@bjmclaughlin @CaptainAwwsum we don't do it. Someone does it for us!  The pleasures of space flight...
1	@TrevorMahlmann already read it!
1	@HD4lyfe5 @TrevorMahlmann yup. Wow
1	Perhaps the wildest #SpotTheStation I've seen. @TrevorMahlmann from an airliner window. Brilliant. http://t.co/5Fk3PMfOJt
1	@smartereveryday @ChrisTheLeft @ISS_Research Are we over the US or Australia during the experiment?  kidding.  I think we should try this!!
1	@sharonbrunton it is essentially morse code. It is sending code to the rescue forces.
1	@JGSnowflake @Ian_Benecken @Astro_Alex @ussoccer @DFB_Team Looking forward to Alex's haircut tomorrow.  I want to see some sheen!!
1	@Pillownaut excellent. My daughter has an ocelot addiction so she will love this!!
1	@PC0101 @GregRawson @NASA I wouldn't call it 'trolling' :)
1	@icelady2910 @Astro_Alex @Msuraev yeah- Max had a GoPro on his ventilator. Love those views!!
1	@roach definitely let us know when that goes live. In the meantime I guess I'll be watching @tracedominguez #fridgeview on #Periscope
1	@PC0101 @BlueEnigma @AstroTerry one of the watches is an actiwatch. Monitors activity- not sure what else but @ISS_Research knows!
-1	@PierAsselin this particular photo was a 3 second exposure. I had the camera mounted on a bogen arm. Stars are a touch blurred because of it
1	@PierAsselin Oh  you can argue with me. It is healthy and welcome discussion! Details of photo+camera settings here: https://t.co/fFWB5QD7JQ
1	@icelady2910 @Astro_Alex depends what you mean by 'harder.' Landing is physically more demanding in my opinion. Launch is harder emotionally
1	@deokon @smartereveryday @StationCDRKelly very benign. Just a tiny push from the engine gently settling you back in your seat.
-1	@smartereveryday @StationCDRKelly correct! Their first three burns are complete. Burn 4 (2nd booster 'cleanup' burn) is 37 minutes away.
1	@davesaad Don't worry Dave  I learned a lot about docking a Soyuz working with @smartereveryday and I had just lived through the real thing!
1	@MysteryAlice @smartereveryday it takes us about 6 hours from launch to docking.
1	@hey_ysoserious @smartereveryday the big thing this year will be @StationCDRKelly in space and comparing data to his twin @ShuttleCDRKelly
-1	@theowl84 @smartereveryday an early off-axis burn tilts our orbit a tiny bit so we don't hit ISS if things break. Gets removed on final burn
1	@roach @apod @Astro_Ron yes! @astro_Pettit also made a beautiful timelapse video I just saw @sxsw
1	@roach @Astro_Ron SMITHERS!
1	@roach @Astro_Ron email sent!
1	@ShuttleAlmanac it is amazing. You don't come 'back to reality' for a solid hour after that ride home!!
1	@luiz_otavio @PC0101 just make sure you know from which direction it will become visible. Should look like a bright airliner
1	.@weasdown HAHA! #Earth of course.  Well  that and Saturn.  I love Saturn.
1	.@AndreaButera #Earth is a perfect canvas. This one of @AstroSamantha's #Italy is probably my #favorite. http://t.co/gRozIIcePP
1	.@VealSlab as a pilot  I would have loved to fly on the shuttle. But riding a #Soyuz and living in Russia for training was priceless.
1	.@AahLiLi even in space  there are occasionally bad days. They can be cured by the #Cupola. In the end  it was better than expected.
1	.@AbsolutSpaceGuy They will enable @Commercial_Crew vehicles to dock without using the robotic arm.
1	@jotulloch @Astro_Wheels @ChabotSpace I made Wheels go home this morning. He was having too much fun!
1	Not quite a #SpaceVine  but first time flying a drone rocked! Thanks @romeoch https://t.co/o5x0nwgSiL
1	@outlandishPIXEL @ActiveAstro I did plenty of that last year. Amazing how much star dust accumulates in the #ISS ventilation returns.
-1	@Astro_yyz @AstroTerry I bet if Terry sees this  he will have a tear in his eye.
-1	@CommanderMLA @KevinSpacey the likeness is scary LA. Don't stand near him in a metro station though. He can get pushy...
1	@tracedominguez I completely understand that statement.
1	Thanks for signing this incredible #spotthestation photo you took @photogbrian - I love it!  w/ @Astro_Wheels MT " http://t.co/dujquOAepI”
1	@Belloni_Ale @DNews gravity felt far too powerful my first few days back on Earth.  After a month him though it is just like old times.
1	@ageekmom concur - but then again you'd be heading to MARS and that would be motivation enough...
1	@Sannsibble @DNews @tracedominguez @astroengine @astVintageSpace Never felt it  oddly enough
1	@Zzay @tracedominguez noise is greatly reduced  but still there.  Like a nice background white noise.
1	@_KristinaluvsU @DNews @tracedominguez @astroengine @astVintageSpace those stories are better shared in person and not recorded online!
-1	@RaHorakhty @NASA @DNews I believe because we are completely isolated.  No one to bring germs in...
-1	@RaHorakhty @NASA @DNews nope!  It was wonderful not to worry about common colds
1	Can't wait! “@DNews: Have questions for @astro_reid  @tracedominguez  @astroengine  or @astVintageSpace? Tweet us! http://t.co/Vg4HdqsuQe”
1	@PC0101 @AnoushehAnsari @TinaMeany @TamithaSkov @grniz2 I'd love to see that from above!
1	@PC0101 @AnoushehAnsari @TinaMeany @TamithaSkov @grniz2
1	@Astro_Wheels sitting out back with a coffee. Loving the gentle breeze  unexpected warmth  and sound of kids laughing on a December morning.
1	@tweetsoutloud @MarsCuriosity I was in #Russia and remember the red mohawk well.  You guys crushed it!  Happy Thanksgiving buddy.
1	@PC0101 you are the talk of the town here. Everyone knows of you now due to your fantastic work.
1	@BoingBoing @ISS_Research @Space_Station I'm so jealous! Good luck @MadeInSpace - hopefully I'll use it next time I visit #space
1	@PC0101 @Mise_1 @grniz2 @eugeniafessia @rocketman528 another favorite - you're doing great work Peter.
1	@PC0101 @eugeniafessia @rocketman528 @sweetgazer1 I loved how you could see the old river path so I snapped the photo.
1	@sachi_bbsr @PC0101 I'm still in the "very happy to be home" phase  and so amazed I just lived up there for 165 days.
1	@PC0101 @paulcomp @Space_Station peter  you are a vault of space knowledge!  In my case though  I was tweeting pics  not names.
1	@fka_roscosmos @ShuttleAlmanac weird to see my friends up there while I'm sitting on my couch down here!
1	@MSGPA any time you feel tense or trapped  just gotta relax and breathe.
1	Spent the afternoon disassembling the successful @DLR_en Capillary Channel Flow experiment. http://t.co/NICqz2WRuJ
1	I LOVE this! Map of our tweets: http://t.co/55QdLVicN7 @astro_alex @msuraev @OlegMKS – thx @DaveAtCOGS http://t.co/PKrkCWYrSf
-1	@Olivia_Dsouza It happens…I attached the wrong photo to this tweet.  Sent a new tweet with corrected photo soon after.
1	@I_We_Gaia I like the solidarity!  I just took my warm wet towel “bath” after a morning workout on the bike.
1	Thanks @photogbrian and @astro_wheels for showing me another amazing #SpotTheStation photo from Austin  TX. http://t.co/cmutRUMcKu
1	I love #science - @tweetsoutloud just emailed me on the #ISS this photo of the @NASA @MarsCuriosity rover. http://t.co/hCJwItw0gK
1	@PC0101 Thanks for the info! Wasn't sure if I was still over Chile or north of it. Good to know.
1	@Olivia_Dsouza @sachi_bbsr @PC0101 @DaveAtCOGS Thanks.  Oddly  the only place you marked that I haven’t been is the international airport.
1	I couldn’t say no to a #selfie with @AstroRobonaut http://t.co/FPqqmTqqtC
1	Cool shot by @astro_alex of me installing an @DLR_en @ISS_research capillary flow payload. http://t.co/MytExMu16z
1	Some smart @NASA @vr_doug engineers turned a simple laptop into a great 3D virtual #spacewalk trainer. http://t.co/LLkGdcBdpc
1	@sachi_bbsr This photo was taken about an hour before I tweeted it. I still think those white lights are boats but can’t verify.
1	@SethGreen @NASA @TheRealBuzz @tweetsoutloud Have fun guys!  Wish I could join in on the fun.
1	@psutympany sure is  both legs  even symmetry.
1	A little on-orbit brain surgery. #Exp40 commander Dr. Swanson removes the head of @AstroRobonaut http://t.co/y45CDWRoJk
1	@spasmunkey  - good guess  but something tells me you are a little too close for a guess ;)
1	Great talking with @jeffreykluger @TIME. MT: Watch @TIME's exclusive video chat with @NASA's ISS http://t.co/dJy999SfGn
1	@Olivia_Dsouza Huge thanks  anyone have a photo of it from ground view?
1	@Astronomika_ @DanSpace77  excellent!!!  Thanks for the info.  Very neat from up here.
1	@jayjum I think that is why. My feet don't impact the ground except for the treadmill.
1	@akanel My stomach feels full all the time  but floating is AMAZING!
1	@ShuttleAlmanac I forgot to add 'MT.'  I highly modified the original tweet. Apologies.
-1	@Ian_Benecken @Astro_Alex in one giant gulp called a slam shift.
1	@Carbon_Flight @jnmatthew well played Ed!!! ;)
1	@ShuttleAlmanac done!
1	@AstroSamantha @cosmos4u @ingallsimages @Astro_Cady @Cmnt8r never let the truth get in the way of a good story! Oh well  still gr8 photo! ;)
1	Houston will intentionally increase drag on the ISS to help phasing for our rendezvous on May 29th. Amazing!  @Astro_Alex @Carbon_Flight
1	@PeterKingCBS Thanks for the good fun!  Talk to you again soon.
1	@Astro_Clay @Astro_Alex how did you know!!!???
-1	@Ian_Benecken @Astro_ried thanks for the info. Sad.
1	@Ian_Benecken @Astro_Alex can we just settle for a tweet ASAP after we get back inside?
1	@CSSEditor @bnjacobs @AstroSamantha those keys open my apartment. But there is a key to enable the Soyuz launch  not in the vehicle though
1	@Astro_Wheels @Carbon_Flight a light day in the RFCR?
1	@Ian_Benecken @AstroSamantha @Astro_Alex he's taking a little break.  Plus  his brain is like a computer ;)
1	@Carbon_Flight @Astro_Alex @fka_roscosmos I say the higher the better!!
1	@LaneLuckie I'm told it is due to atomic oxygen in space which hits the thermal cover and causes discoloration.
1	@sharonbrunton looks like something @Cmdr_Hadfield would certainly have found!
1	@csf_spaceflight @amikokauderer @CommanderMLA @NASA_Johnson thanks for the photo...I remember that day well!!
1	@Space_Lectures Ken Ham
1	@tweetsoutloud @skydart I think maybe an autocorrect error worked in your favor buddy. The j apparently became an h.
1	@simon_rp84 @Astro_Alex it is.....or was.
1	@joannekarma @Astro_Alex it is going great and we are enjoying the entertainment.
1	@grb090423 certainly. Good luck. Or in Russia- ни пуха ни пера.
1	@grb090423 well  lunch is certainly part of the plan :)
1	@darenwelsh @Astro_Alex @SpaceCenterHou interesting question. By hand or by machine?
1	@AeroSpaceKnight @ESA_EAC couldn't nap or sleep. That was actually quite hard to prevent!
1	Spent 6 hours in a recliner for metabolic rate baseline testing @ESA_EAC today. Can't beat forced relaxation! http://t.co/3BFwkhH3sl
1	@LAismylady @chicklets_1999 @ESA_EAC @esa gets pretty warm and tastes fantastic. Seriously!
1	@chicklets_1999 @ESA_EAC @esa this is the same food I'll eat in space. I just needed to warm it up by dunking it in hot water.
1	'Cooking' up a delicious lunch of salmon and vegetables @ESA_EAC for the @esa ENERGY experiment. http://t.co/p3f8SstnqC
1	@tweetsoutloud @Astro_Alex I have room for one more if you have the $$!
1	@Ian_Benecken  @Astro_Alex - no changes. I was simply looking at Steve's procedures so I had a better idea of his challenges working w/arm.
1	@joannekarma I though the same thing...
1	@joannekarma @Astro_Alex @esaoperations all of that training was for real.  We have never staged a photo/video...
1	@muellerspace @tweetsoutloud @Astro_Alex yes  myself  Alex  and Oleg are all rookies...
1	@tweetsoutloud @Astro_Alex excited and yet oddly  extremely relaxed.  More so than at any other point in my life.
1	@Brigitte_Ba @Astro_Alex I'll ask her!
-1	@tweetsoutloud @Carbon_Flight @NASA I'm certainly up for the challenge!!
1	@spacechelle @Astro_Alex actually  they bought me a countdown clock for Christmas. No joke! ;)
1	@SpaceKSCBlog I think I'll pass on that one!
1	@Pillownaut @Astro_Alex thanks Heather!
1	@vr_doug @Astro_Alex @esa @NASA great expression!  Thanks for the photo
1	@vr_doug @NASA_Johnson @Astro_Alex cool pic!!
-1	@JeriLRyan - I looked all over Star City today. Sadly no bubble wrap ;) @Astro_Kate7 @astro_kjell @AstroIronMike @Astro_Cady @spasmunkey
1	@Ian_Benecken same!
1	@Ian_Benecken @Astro_Alex I would say the names are TBD at this point.
1	@Thom_astro @Astro_Alex if we are in manual reentry and I'm flying  there will be no need to pump.  Just verbal encouragement will suffice.
1	@Ian_Benecken @Astro_Alex I don't believe that to be true. We will know for sure when we are both outside #ISS in spacesuits
1	@Carbon_Flight @Astro_Alex it's a beauty!
-1	Eating dinner in Star City with 5 of the 6 2009 @ESA_EAC astronauts. Only missing our buddy @astro_luca - #shenanigans
1	@ShuttleAlmanac well done!  It is all white here now but you're spot on!
1	@ShuttleAlmanac despite the cold  Russian ice cream is still delicious though!!
1	@tweetsoutloud @stevenroy27 @chevrolet deal!
1	@tweetsoutloud @stevenroy27 @chevrolet you landed a car on Mars. I trust ya.
1	@tweetsoutloud @chevrolet I wish...but I would gladly pay to fund that technology. Amazing.
1	@tweetsoutloud did you see the 2015 Z06 corvette?  I might be selling my family truckster and bringing back the tradition. Wow.
1	@Thom_astro @Astro_Alex I see some #shenanigans in our future!
1	@NERDHERDGUY4824 @Astro_Clay Princess Bride followed by Shawshank. Passed the time perfectly.
1	@Astro_Clay @NERDHERDGUY4824 there have been requests for princess bride and I have Shawshank on standby.
1	@Astro_yyz I'll knock out a movie or two and then spend the rest of the time doing evaluations of the suit.  Reach  fit  feel  etc.
1	@eugeniafessia unfortunately  no. But I have trained with him off and on for the last 4 years. A brilliant mind.
1	@DaveAtCOGS wow...that is great!!!! Will you do this for E40/41 too?
-1	@sharonbrunton not too bad during...much worse after!
1	@spacechelle @msengupta @Astro_Maker @Astro_Kate7 yup Maker  she's lost it!  I'm ready to SING!!  Break out the dress whites....
1	@sharonbrunton very interesting!  Thanks for the photo
1	@spasmunkey 37 years of practicing. I think I'll be good!
1	@acebrodie @lewisjcampbell @spacechelle @RealMacKaySTV absolutely fantastic.  I think the frog looks quite happy...
1	@spacechelle nope  it is my friends that are the main contributor!! ;)
1	@andresdavid I think it is fun!!
1	@SolX2010 @Stratocumulus  if you are talking to @astro_mike you have the best advice around. Glad to hear all is going well!
-1	@Astro_Alex @Carbon_Flight @ESA_EAC  Celebrated with my parents  Carroll and the kids. Only missing you and Max!
1	@bigunderscorec EVA assistant is the end goal. For now it is used by crew  and the hope is to have ground operators controlling.
1	@Earther57 @libbydoodle @jtowns @ageekmom Penny  I love it!  Just saw the article too. Nicely done!!
1	@spasmunkey @Carbon_Flight hey!
1	@sharonbrunton a huge difference!
1	@omaflinger @ProteinWrangler @sidbyrd @travelholic greetings from Tsukuba  Japan!  Sorry I'll miss Frenchies. Great food!!
1	@ShuttleAlmanac I just sent it to public affairs.  Should be up soon!
-1	@ApolloSoyuzSara @Astro_Alex I can confirm my inability to wait. Let's go!
1	When @Carbon_Flight speaks  @Astro_Alex and I listen. Expedition 41 design just approved! #worththewait? http://t.co/EheZuAfyAb
-1	@sharonbrunton you're right on family...they have fist rights to launch but if there are openings I'll let you know Sharon!
1	. @Astro_Alex moving 750lbs (340kg) with ease in the virtual reality trainer @NASA_Johnson @vr_doug http://t.co/i7TiBICt11
-1	@sharonbrunton we get to invite 15 people and they have to pay their way. Extremely expensive!
1	@sharonbrunton the next year should be a blast!
1	@cosmos4u wow...AMAZING!  Absolutely amazing.  Thanks!
1	@kmccoy beautiful picture...perfectly framed!  Thanks!
1	@SpaceKate trust me...I'm cherishing every moment  knowing how lucky I am  and wishing everyone could join in this adventure.
1	@jayjum ok...ok. You make a good point.
1	@Carbon_Flight @astro_alex @camilla_sdo concur. This bird better start pulling her weight (which isn't much!!)
1	@spasmunkey @astro_alex @carbon_flight you better believe I've been there. First visit wasn't until '09 though.
1	@sharonbrunton no EVA currently scheduled...but the schedule always changes
1	@radiobartlett I only have degrees in computer and systems engineering.  I'll just cross my fingers with each flush...
1	@Carbon_Flight @astro_alex I'll bring my tactical sword to work from now on!
1	@Astro_Clay @romeoch @astro_alex "we" are anything but normal because we know you  Clay!
1	@rocketman528 EAC for a week and then home sweet home.
1	FYI @MondoBasso @cbsbaltimore - it is officially Super Bowl Weekend in Russia! Preparing to paint the town #PURPLE with @astroterry #Ravens
1	@Pillownaut that is hilarious!
1	@jnmatthew @carbon_flight #blushing
1	@Carbon_Flight @camilla_sdo @astro_alex we have ways of finding out what u r doing flight!  But only for 5 more minutes.
1	@sharonbrunton we do winter survival in case we land off target and need to wait a day or two for pickup. Plus it is good general knowledge.
1	@Camilla_SDO @nasa_johnson @astro_clay no one has moves like Clay!!
1	@sharonbrunton I was at zero g for a bit today as a matter of fact!  It was fantastic.
1	@sharonbrunton thankfully it will be weightless... It is designed for use with the gloves so all the settings are glove-friendly.
1	@sharonbrunton yes  very heavy.  The real suit is about 300 pounds but this version is a bit less. Nearly impossible to walk in it.
1	It is a great day when the legendary @tweetsoutloud has joined the adventure.  Great meeting you Friday! #mohawktime http://t.co/8ByTQ043
1	@Camilla_SDO @carbon_flight @astro_alex Camilla- can you explain why I found twigs and debris in the Soyuz yesterday?  R U nesting?
1	Watching Russia take on Portugal in 'football' then the #orioles start at 1am.  Great night! @sharonbrunton - Pulling 4 Ireland 4u!
1	@thenasaman @h_p_r_u @astron8 I can confirm receipt by his mom since his mom just emailed the photo to him during our lunch in Чкаловский.
1	@spacechelle I'd say the last rendezvous was better than this one.  I always like unexpected outcomes  especially if it involves Hams...
1	@sharonbrunton some people talk of a 'falling' sensation.  I'll let you know in a year and a half...
1	@Pillownaut I love these stats!  Nice work!!
1	@sharonbrunton you know too much!  Yeah  it was a great day of flying.
1	@romeoch love the Russian suit!
1	@Pillownaut @chrisastro @woodtoast @camilla_sdo we have just under 2 years to make this happen. So I'm sayin' there's a chance!
1	@Carbon_Flight @astrosamantha @astro_alex Ed...we're going to take great care of our outpost in space  because we want to be invited back!
-1	@sharonbrunton no NEEMO for me unfortunately...
1	@eugeniafessia @costantiniwm I couldn't figure out what the car was for  but I want to try it!
1	@sharonbrunton hi Sharon.  I will do about half in Russia  half in the US. There are hundreds of satellites higher than the ISS.
1	@CRKARLA Ola!
1	@sharonbrunton I will do some training in the centrifuge. I did some in the navy as well.  It was always fun...
1	@sharonbrunton that's an incredible photo. What are the chances of a cloudless sky over such a vast area?
1	@sharonbrunton thanks Sharon!  Same to you.
1	@Camilla_SDO @carbon_flight @astro_alex we'd love to have you Camilla...unless you're CHICKEN!
-1	@Camilla_SDO @carbon_flight I'm willing to educate if this would be worth your time  but I'm warning you- there's wild hungry dogs there!
1	@Camilla_SDO @carbon_flight let me take you to Star City in March and I promise I'll use you to extend my reach in the spacecraft!
1	@jayjum yeah  not sure.  I honestly think NASA's use of social media played a big role...
1	Just learned that @Carbon_Flight (Ed Van Cise) will be my lead flight director for Expedition 41 on the #ISS. Fantastic news for our crew!

1	@DieterM @elonmusk Great. I berthed 1st Dragon to ISS and am impressed by SpaceX. Would love to go to Mars this way. Hope the timeline holds
1	@emgoyaars Model van de eerste maanlander. Van de Sovjet Unie. Voor de Amerikanen.
1	@emgoyaars https://t.co/l1udQLqeVJ
-1	@WPSCHAASBERG @AustinOnSocial You also count people "hiding" in the moonlander  cars  houses  caves  etc. #fail
1	@Vision23 @AustinOnSocial Of course you do. You also include the peole hidden in the moonlander and houses etc.
1	@emgoyaars Sovjet Unie landde eerder op de maan met onbemande Lunagod. Bracht ook stenen terug. Test van bemande raket mislukte. Gaven op
1	@emgoyaars Ik kon ook geen/nauwelijks sterren zien als ik aan de felbelichte dagkant naar de aarde keek.
1	@emgoyaars Als je het negatief overbelicht worden de sterren weer zichtbaar
-1	@emgoyaars Door de hoeveelheid licht die van het pak en de grond komt is de camera niet meer gevoelig voor het zwakke sterrenlicht

1	@vancalmthout @NewsFromSpace Dat was het roet aan de buitenkant vd Soyuz na de vurige 1500-2000gr terugkeer door de atmosfeer.
1	@Hugefourtytwo Het zal er heel anders uit zien en niet op DNA basis. We zoeken ook naar kunstmatige ellectromagnetische signalen.
-1	@Hugefourtytwo Niks uitsluiten  maar waarschijnlijk H2O en C based. Dat zoeken bij kometen  op Mars  onder ijs op manen Europa/Enceladus
1	@Hugefourtytwo Definitie leven oa chemische/fysische interactie met omgeving  voortplanting. Zoeken naar "onnatuurlijke" moleculen/signalen
1	@Hugefourtytwo Leven waarschijnlijk gebaseerd op koolstof. Kan meeste verbindingen maken.
1	@Hugefourtytwo Op oceaanbodem bij 300 graden nog steeds vloeibaar water en gebasserd op koolstof en familie van ons.
1	@Hugefourtytwo H2O is overal in heelal. Neutrale vloeistof nodig voor  delicate chemische reacties.
1	@Hugefourtytwo Astroiden bevatten mogelijk metalen voor electronica industrie. Op Aarde zeldzaam. Vereist mijnbouw in Afrika/Groenland/etc
1	@Hugefourtytwo Het idee is Helium3 winning als totaal schone brandstof voor potentiele kernfusiereactoren.

-1	@gravitate_to_me :) I still sometimes slip up and it aggravates me.
-1	@tarynoneill @Scirens What the...? I posted to instagram and push to twitter  so it must've found the nearest match. Weird.
1	@GeorgeTakei @Uncannygirl ... unless you're an astronomer. #harumph
1	@jimcvit @mlthaller That's about how Galileo saw it. :)
1	@alexwitze @nadiamdrake NICE. Congrats!
1	@jayvise Nice!
1	@NeverKnitDrunk I love it when that happens. The geometry is fun.
1	@RyanWVoll Please don’t involve me in conversations with flat earthers.
1	@sandentotten Knowing I’m doing what I can to Save The World helps.
1	@shaka_lulu Wow! Nice glory!
1	@AmandaSchull Niiiiice! Congrats @TerryMatalas @EmilyHampshire_ @AaronAStanford!
1	.@AmandaSchull @goldengateblond Amanda  here is more info  too: https://t.co/URXzFQXb70
1	@sandentotten @jamingray @MikeDrucker @BillNye @TeagWall @flichtman Oh  you.
1	@elakdawalla @hubbahubble @Tuplet Andereweltenhaustraurigkeit
1	@sandentotten It's happened so many times that I think it does prove it.
-1	@sandentotten I'm getting suspicious of you.
1	My pal @SciGuySpace agrees about Blue Origin  too: We’re seeing the dawn of an industry here. https://t.co/WJH7se6wkr
1	@sanjaromin Wow. That’s great!
1	@spaceguy87 Ah. Got it. Thanks!
1	@shakaplan I eat there every time I'm in town since we filmed Bad Universe. :)
1	@starstryder @SurlyAmy I really like this one.
1	@omcintyre @YouGoatMail Ordered it  Dottie? I lived it.
1	@AmandaSchull You are Elmer J. Fudd. Millionaire. You own a mansion and a yacht.
1	@LudLer @Pharaoness That’s one of my favorite things to see too. It never gets old.
1	@antisophista Thanks  but I'm not qualified; I have no experience at all running a planetarium! Also  I'm not looking for a job. :)
1	@ladygaga4life98 @luanuzumaki06 If an asteroid were coming our astronomers would be yelling it from the rooftops. So  no  were OK.
1	@ladygaga4life98 No. https://t.co/Gxa2yadAFt
1	@HiRISE I would never claim that.
1	@GoodyAwards Wow  thank you!
1	@RachelFeltman @Cmdr_Hadfield Ha! I just replied to him; I thought the exact same thing.
1	@hollyamos22 @tweetsoutloud Have you tried swapping out the bio-neural gel pack?
-1	@tweetsoutloud @hollyamos22 @CharterCom But just like a bad ISP you. Keep. Missing. The target download rates.
1	@dinkspal Coooool
1	@mikamckinnon Did the Earth move for you? Etc etc
1	@hollyamos22 @NASA @OSIRISREx That’s another thing to Chekov the list.
1	@hollyamos22 @NASA @OSIRISREx Zulu  Holly. ZZZZzzzzzz.
1	@jqmcd @arielwaldman Cool! I wrote a lot of the web stuff back in the day.
1	@jqmcd @arielwaldman I know. I worked on the education/public outreach for that mission. :)
1	@HiRISE That is gorgeous.
1	@BeckePhysics Cool!
1	@CassC13 I'm still around. My panel with @tweetsoutloud was better anyway. ;)
1	Agreed. RT @ponder68: Op-ed: We love you SpaceX  and hope you reach Mars. But we need you to focus. https://t.co/Wdb7XnQ7wl @SciGuySpace
1	@Caissie @tweetsoutloud Cool!
1	Who's at Star Trek Mission NYC? My panel is at 12:15 about what real aliens will be like: "Ugly Bags of Mostly Water" w/ @tweetsoutloud
1	@AmandaSchull Thanks Amanda!
1	@TerryMatalas @12MonkeysRoom @EmilyHampshire_ Ah. I was being obscure. https://t.co/0ezUZ2PQ7B.  /cc @AmandaSchull
-1	@HiRISE Dang. That's weird. Volcano or crater? Lots of wind there though.
1	@DanBatcheldor Geez  I forgot those are still on Cafe Press. Nice!
1	@Miz_Mora @Summer_Ash @startorialist I'll be there this weekend for a Star Trek con.  :)
1	@Pomerantz @virgingalactic Oh my gosh! That’s a good point. The answer is yes. :)
1	@tweetsoutloud Thanks Bobak. And see you in a couple of days!
1	@kejames @MikeDrucker Yup. That was another reason I was happy to be on board. Specifics to come later…
1	@arielwaldman @MikeDrucker Yup! Thanks. :)
1	@RachelFeltman :) Thanks!
1	@MaryEMcGlynn @BabakTafreshi @tweetsoutloud I'll be there the last day of Hawaii con. :)
-1	@MaryEMcGlynn @BabakTafreshi @tweetsoutloud Yeah  almost certainly that’s the culprit.

1	@MaryEMcGlynn @blumspew @Eppixadventures @NASA @SPACEdotcom Wow! Was that an Iridium flare?
-1	@TheSpaceGal Oh  once a year or so indulge myself.
1	@smartereveryday @Objectivity_Vid @royalsociety @coollike We all paid a steep price.
1	@halfastro @merrdiff THAT’S AMAZING. And Im totally using this in a blog post. You don’t get to say no. :)
1	@omcintyre @exploreplanets @Celestron It was nice to meet you! I hope all the 'scopes raise lots of cash for TPS.
1	@SciGuySpace Good heavens. Then why build it? Why spend billions on old tech? Cripes.

1	@markmccaughrean Thank you  Mark!
1	@ThatChrisGore @StarTrek That’s *fantastic*!
1	@moredena @elleteedee I'm honestly glad to hear that. Good on you. :)
1	@moredena @elleteedee Oh my. Are things better now?
1	@hubbahubble @ChineseRoom Some of it will be pretty obvious.
1	@hubbahubble @ChineseRoom Cool! I consulted on that game. :) I hope you like it!
1	@RonBaalke It's a bird.
1	@RonBaalke Wow! You’re getting good stuff on that cam.
1	@FakeAstropix How many times has @JonAustinjourn1 tweeted about the end of the world? He must be batting 0.000. By definition.
1	@connollyjeff1 @Slate Musk will have more to say in Sept. And thanks! I’m glad you liked CCA!
1	@connollyjeff1 I wrote this about it: https://t.co/SVWXpmd4Ne
1	@starstryder AHA! OK then  thanks. I mean  my friend says thanks.
1	@starstryder WELL? Are they as good? Asking for a Thin Mint addicted friend who has literally 8 cookies left from Gallifrey 1.
1	@b0yle @HillaryClinton Thanks for the shout out  Alan. :)
1	@1995kim No.
1	@That_MarcC I will  after I eat. I do that every day. It helps a lot.
1	@NGC3314 @kippteague Yup. I was 6.
1	@astro_reid @USNavy @nanopore Nice. :)
1	@RonBaalke Yay?
1	@mikamckinnon I definitely need to sit down with you and talk tsunamis. Seismic and asteroidal impacty.
1	My friend @mikamckinnon did a very cool tweet series on landslides  tsunamis  and seiches. Start here: https://t.co/kYsAHVF9AA
1	@mikamckinnon Oh I think they’re fascinating. Pretty much ever since I stood on the rim of La Palma and looked down.
1	@mikamckinnon FIVE CUBIC KM. FIVE.   I won’t sleep for a week now. Wow.
1	@katherinen COOL
1	Via @katherinen I just learned of @RobotsAndDonuts  and OMG I LOVE THIS ART.  https://t.co/AQsWzJh123
1	@katherinen @RobotsAndDonuts HOW HAVE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE!!!?!??!
1	This is bizarre and wonderful and needs to happen to a LOT more things. @peeweeherman  make it so. https://t.co/KMGyfzbt3j
1	@HiRISE I prefer the turtleception. #AllTheWayDown
1	@Neil_Zee @TourismJasper @GeorgeTakei Cool! It’ll be nice to meet the man who took this photo: https://t.co/gh5YhQd9jp :)
-1	@doughtywench Cripes  you remember the angry slippers?
1	@TheMathadon I liked it. I can’t wait to see how they resolve the mess they left everyone in. :)
1	@SirDoubtsALot @kommodant @pguyton Yes  that’s it. GISS does the same thing. I explain it here: https://t.co/wy3FPBl2uZ
1	@kommodant @pguyton @SirDoubtsALot Each month is compared to *that* month for each year. That’s why lines don’t connect.

1	@gravitate_to_me   Step 1: Galaxy collision Step 2: ??? Step 3: SMBH merger  profit
1	@lyndalovon He says why in the article. Statistically it’s getting safer and could save a lot of lives.
1	@sequentialkady I read that in its original Latin.
1	Proof that @AmandaSchull really is a time traveler. #12Monkeys cc @TerryMatalas @EmilyHampshire_ @AaronAStanford https://t.co/aYpjoXTTzI
1	@RobinEdgar Sounds like it may have been the Peekskill meteor. Look it up! Amazing story.
1	@morgfair @The_News_DIVA @ShiCooks @LarsJohanL @Alex_Verbeek @RawStory It's interesting! But I couldn't find any journal papers about it. :/
-1	@DrMRFrancis @NoisyAstronomer And res this: https://t.co/dYvURtT8Sv She’s wrong about Constellation  too.
1	@AmandaSchull Wow! Way more than Mars in there  too: Saturn  Antares (and nebula around it)  the Rho Ophiuchi nebula… Dang.
-1	@DJSnM The existence of tomatoes and plankton can somehow be used by deniers to “prove” Apollo was faked.
1	@AmandaSchull @TheEricGoldman You Litt him up.
1	@tweetsoutloud @NASAVoyager @reddit Wow. That impact though. Brrrr.
1	@MysterMyke Nah. Thanks  though. It’s a ways off.
1	@starstryder @roseveleth @SurlyAmy I’ve received tweets from people who know the area and say it is indeed Baton Rouge.
1	@roseveleth @SurlyAmy @starstryder Ohhhhh  I didn’t read it that way at all. OK  my mistake; I’ll correct it. Thanks!
1	@SurlyAmy @starstryder @roseveleth … but I don’t have confirmation either way.
1	@SurlyAmy @starstryder @roseveleth As I understand it it’s not from Baton Rouge: https://t.co/OtfA8zPxyL
-1	@tiffany_wishon @FakeAstropix No  that page is complete baloney. Too much to even summarize here.
1	@g_rempel Yikes!
-1	@tamarakrinsky Me too. I hate missing a chance to see so many friends.
1	@tamarakrinsky I assume you mean me? :) Nope  I’m not going this year. I wish I could!
1	@tamarakrinsky @Miz_Mora @tarynoneill My pleasure! That was a fun interview.
1	Be smart: Listen to my friends @tamarakrinsky @miz_mora &amp; @tarynoneill talk science on The Women of Marvel podcast! https://t.co/QmsmK8Zed5
1	@FakeAstropix It’s not a meteorite until after it hits  so a meteorite can’t hit the Earth. :)
1	@KidmatEdenBlog Hmmm  yes. I didn’t mean like a ha-ha or bright smile  more of a sad one. But the sentiment of the story is nice.
1	@TheMathadon Heh. I forgot about that one.
-1	@DaveMosher At least they’d never make that same mistake twice.  &lt;cough cough&gt; #SLS &lt;cough&gt;
-1	@tacticalskyguy Do you understand that Philando Castile did not resist  and was shot anyway?
1	@rsimmon @NASA_Landsat @NASAEarth Oh  that’s very cool. I’ll read this in the morning. Thanks!
1	This article by @SciGuySpace about NASA and the current Obama administration is on point. https://t.co/xvKvYcgrmg
1	6/ But I have a soapbox and can shine a light. I want to know more. So I’m listening to @DNLee5  @DrRubidium  @IBJIYONGI  &amp; @dblackanese.

1	@HiRISE It will have yet already happen.

1	My pal @pharaoness has more links about #Juno on G+: https://t.co/bu1wrVBXaP
1	@mikamckinnon Yeah  I’d love to do one of those someday. Bad timing combined with having to fly in and all that.
-1	@mikamckinnon @EricDexLa I might be a *tad* jealous. Just a  tad.
1	@mikamckinnon Welllllll… https://t.co/sVkNh2BCV4
1	@jqmcd Good point. They run into their house when storms come  so I expect they’ll do that with fireworks. I plan on checking them a lot.

1	@flugennock @kwmurphy @airandspace Thanks for coming! And to the NASM for hosting it. :)
1	@mikamckinnon @ClarkPlanet Ha. Yeah. They're good people there.

1	@lizlandau @DrMRFrancis I think it’s different; no small clump near the core. But it does look like optical+X-ray!
1	@Daisyletgo @airandspace See you there! :)
1	@RonBaalke @geoffnotkin That sure looks like a meteorite to me. Coooool.
1	@wilw @SirEviscerate @xeni @AnneWheaton Same here  different wife.
1	@SpaceGeena Sure! I’l be around there some of the day  though I’m not sure just where and when.
-1	@mggtTaylor OK  comets scoff at *most people’s* gravity.
1	Just so’s y’all know  @DrNeilTyson isn’t actually Neil Tyson. It’s a parody account. You want @neiltyson.
1	@mcnees Nice!
1	@PictureTheSouth @Charlotte_Five I’d expect that to be in Cardiff  not in NC!
1	@SirDoubtsALot Nope.
1	My pal @amandaschull is on “Murder in the First” on TNT right now! Watch her in that  then on #12Monkeys on @Syfy tomorrow.

1	@WA4LZC Wow  beautiful iridescent cloud!
1	@MaryEMcGlynn A lot of intolerance oozing to the surface here and elsewhere.
1	@PeterDEdmonds Thanks for including me!
1	@71djt Hubble doesn’t use a lens.
1	Wow. @PeterDEdmonds has a *lot* of astronomy info links for your perusal. https://t.co/NjcAnQGKH2
-1	@sarim0t0 That is patently untrue. Solar use is accelerating in this country and is cheaper than fossil in some places.
-1	A nice interview with @fakeastropix on how to spot a fake photo. Avoid those spammy photo accounts! https://t.co/ezo3yOhnkm
1	@Miz_Mora @YogaWorks Ah yes  the Spitzer Infrared Orion Stretch. @startorialist
1	@FakeAstropix @MENnewsdesk Oh for heaven’s sake.
1	@PalePrimate I wrote about that: https://t.co/QBYD6k3s75
1	@wxlada Oh  nice. I’ll read that. And yes  I spent quite a bit of time on this last night (and second guessing myself this morning :).
1	@wxlada Yup. Quite a mess. Different time zones  crossing date line  etc.
1	@FakeAstropix @StargazerRob @PicPedant Thanks! But… this is a better link. :) https://t.co/u5wh0bplke
1	@Astroguyz @b0yle Once every 19 years or so for a given solstice sounds rare to me! Next one on a June solstice won’t be until 2062.
1	@tianquiztentli @WORLDSTAR Dang. But I have little goats. Not sure how’d they fair here. :)
-1	@nyrath *Some* of the air freezes here. But on Mars it snows out in the winter. Pressure drops by 30% or so.

1	@IraThorpe @LIGO Wow  thank you!

1	@startorialist Done.
1	@markmccaughrean Just checked; while I wrote about VE many times  I never did put up images like the ones you linked. I’ll amend the post.
1	@markmccaughrean Good point! It’s been ten years  and I simply didn’t think about it. Arg! :/
-1	@TheSpaceGal Sometimes. I don't reply  I block. No one gets to tell me what I can and can't say. I'm a human with opinions and a soapbox.
1	@startorialist Of course. It’ll go up in the morning.
1	@startorialist Thanks.
1	@startorialist May I use that solar heart pic in a blog post?
1	@AmandaSchull &lt;3
1	@One_Classy_Bum @TheSpaceGal You are responding to a tweet about it being inappropriate for a stranger to tell someone they are sexy.
-1	@JoshMattson No  and I want to. So weird.
1	@GerardoBarbosa I don't know  but that all looks CGI. I'm not sure if it's actually photos from orbit or not.
1	@LDMay @ridingrobots I think we were just Marsplained.
1	@NGC3314 @SpaceGeck I think that’s exactly what it is. I’m going to read the papers next. :) Reminds me of the Red Rectangle.
1	@Alex_Parker @Wikipedia NIIIIIICE. Alex  how much work did you put into that?
1	@mlv @Oatmeal The GOP has been responsible for extraordinary and unprecedented levels of obstruction in Congress.
1	@BeckePhysics Nice! Astronomers shouldn’t even bother printing books. Things chase too quickly. :)
1	@MysterMyke That’s adorable… but I’m not sure how good it is for a goat to sit that way for long.

1	@AmandaSchull Amanda Panda banana. @EmilyHampshire_ must be having a field day with this.
1	@ElbesoenlaLuna @PlanetarioMad @esa_es @MarsCuriosity @MarsRovers Wow  very cool!
1	@aztec_again Wow  how pretty! I need to see that for myself someday...
1	@EmilyHampshire_ @AmandaSchull Oh. Duh. Because of her predilection for eating eucalyptus leaves.
1	@AmandaSchull @EmilyHampshire_ Y’all are MEAN. #WhyNoNicknameForAmandaYet?
1	@AmandaSchull @GregoryAlanBush @AaronAStanford OMG “casserole”? That’s the ‘ship name? Inevitable  I suppose.
1	@tweetsoutloud @Lisa831 In Australia I saw lots of signs for Donner kebobs  and they had no idea why I laughed so hard at that name.
1	@tweetsoutloud DAMMIT! I didn’t even think of that.
1	@tweetsoutloud FWIW it didn’t accept FERDOWSI either. https://t.co/wvjEAiiFxx
1	@EmilyHampshire_ Why are you and @amandaschull so happy when @AaronAStanford and @barbara_sukowa are so dour? What did you do  Emily?
1	@tanyaofmars @AstroAnarchy @SurlyAmy @starstryder @elakdawalla @jmars_gis That is pretty seriously cool.
1	@SurlyAmy @starstryder @fcain Here’s a VERY hi res map. You’ll have to look for the features… https://t.co/7wJxKVfEQy
-1	@SurlyAmy @starstryder @fcain Wait  no  that’s no good. Still looking…
1	@SurlyAmy @starstryder @fcain Try here: https://t.co/rAo68falPF
1	@AmandaSchull Pbbbt. The acting on that show is amazing. Easy enough to say how good you are. :)
1	@AmandaSchull You were very good. :)
1	@AmandaSchull Wow. I watched it. That was pretty dang cool.
1	@AmandaSchull [Hi Amanda!] Yeah  I’ve been saving the last three. Gonna marathon them tonight. Wish me luck.
1	@AmandaSchull Watched Lullaby again last night  and yeah. Wow. The whole show leads to that one episode.
1	@HiRISE Oh  that’s a weird one. Looks like it had a melt pool &amp; then later landslides. The floor is so flat!
1	@elakdawalla @hubbahubble :) That’s why I wrote it!
1	@DawnC331 @xeni I hear this guy talked to Musk about it. :) https://t.co/Al7lSNSrcl
1	@DaveMosher Infinite? It would look like a planet with no humans on it.
1	@brianwolven @Alex_Parker Oh dang. Well done.
1	@TerryMatalas @AmandaSchull You know  I have some ideas about that. :)
1	@hubbahubble I feel bad for you  but that was the funniest tweet I've read all day.
1	@morgfair @The_News_DIVA @ShiCooks @LarsJohanL But many media have been reporting it straight. Control group may’ve been messed up.
1	@morgfair @The_News_DIVA @ShiCooks @LarsJohanL It’s been getting roundly torn apart on science blogs  and rightly so IMO.
-1	@morgfair @The_News_DIVA @ShiCooks @LarsJohanL Morgan  that cell phone study was almost certainly baloney. https://t.co/lzRIVeaNh1
1	@jayvise @MargaretOrr Wow! Lovely shot!
1	@SUGEN24 Cool! Glad to help!
1	@starstryder Heh. Joe has a degree in astronomy. :)
1	@fcain Uh oh. Better clear some space on your hard drive.  https://t.co/OX5lMgPRKZ
1	@starstryder Oh hey  cool! I’ve walked past that many times visiting the aquarium and such in the harbor.
1	@tweetsoutloud @instagram @Cmdr_Hadfield Yeah  I think Chris has this covered. https://t.co/dq6NqeCFKH
1	@DJSnM None  happily. I just scanned the titles there  and um. Yeah.
-1	Worried about cell phones causing cancer? Despite breathless news stories  I’m not. Here’s why: https://t.co/Ddp4aiw2cc  by @RachelFeltman
-1	My pal @b0yle has more on the @SpaceX booster landing (w/ video): https://t.co/X1QNYphi0g
1	@DJSnM @xZise Actually  no  that’s new to me. I’ll have to look this up. By “higher” though I meant from where it was when I tweeted. :)
1	@Summer_Ash @DrMRFrancis Thanks! :)
1	@CaseyDreier Thanks Casey!
-1	@AmandaSchull Holy cats! You weren’t kidding about the fight training. Oof.
1	@DrMRFrancis I just mean in general. Re: See my article today. W/o peer review  anyone can say anything.
1	@DrMRFrancis Replace “arXiv” with “Facebook” and you’re saying the same thing.
-1	@prezcannady @Rand_Simberg @genejm29 @omcintyre I strongly disagree. This case exemplifies the problems with that.
1	@lauriecantillo Thanks. :)
1	@tweetsoutloud I bite everything. I'm a biter.
1	.@tweetsoutloud White balance sounds like something GOP Senators meet about behind closed doors.
-1	@tweetsoutloud Cool! Too bad you missed the supernova just out of frame.
1	@starstryder @AmyMainzer @listen2spacepod A) Amy  very very cool. 2) Eric  you made me laugh.
1	@ProfMike_M @Club_La_Reforma @WorldAndScience Thanks! I try very hard to track down sources  unlike those icky accounts.
1	@Summer_Ash @startorialist I saw that one. :) Thought you might like that she wore it to give a TED talk on black holes.
1	@startorialist @Summer_Ash You’ll like this  I’d wager: https://t.co/LHchYh3ajT
1	@RonBaalke That number makes it sound like a good... enterprise.
-1	@mikamckinnon No  I haven’t gone in a while  and don’t have any plans to go back this year. :/
1	@mikamckinnon Ah. I see this now. I'll read it.
1	@mikamckinnon I think I sense an interesting conversation next time we meet. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
1	@paulkoan @DJSnM There’s this: https://t.co/Ob246iASdX :)
1	@sequentialkady We do at least two of these getaways every year. :)
1	@SpaceGeck @FakeAstropix Using Yorkshire as a location  I can’t get the MW to look like that at any time of the year in SkySafari. Hmm.
1	@meteorbill @FakeAstropix @brianwolven @TheAstroShake @SpaceGeck @sikaheimo @BritAstro That’s *very* cool.
1	@PlutoKuiper @Fermilab @AdlerPlanet That’s great! Seeing Saturn for the 1st time is always an amazing thing. :)
1	@DJSnM Ha! The parking lot gives it away. :)
1	@moredena @TheCrashCourse Oh  *wow*. That was truly wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing! And I hope he gets to Saturn. :)
1	@FailedProtostar NICE
1	@JPMajor @Slate Oh  that was fun. Thanks!
1	@RonBaalke @jayvise I estimate by eye that if it were retrograde it would pass us ~15-20 km/sec faster.
1	@jayvise @RonBaalke Yes  but also on a very elliptical orbit  so it’s falling in from a long way.
-1	@RonBaalke Whoa  that 2nd one comes screaming in. It’s a big one  too.
1	@FakeAstropix @TheAstroShake @SpaceGeck @apod Good point. Probably no Ni. Many Perseids are green tho so either other molecule or O from air
1	@SanMedra @polymetric_ Dslr  5 sec  f4.5  not sure what zoom setting.
1	@BeckePhysics @PlanetaryKeri :)
1	@DrLisaNagy I’m lycan it.
1	@tweetsoutloud YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.  (I’m next to the goats)
1	@AstroKatie @tweetsoutloud Katie I JUST saw you like four years ago.
1	@tweetsoutloud We two shall meet again.
1	@FakeAstropix @TheAstroShake @SpaceGeck @apod You get green from oxygen  but also nickel from the meteoroid itself. :)
1	@RonBaalke Oh  that’s cool.
1	@fzammetti @AmyMainzer When they resort to Red Vines we know all is lost.
1	@3point1four159 Yup. I pop up in pretty much every episode  waving my hands and getting excited about stuff. :)
1	@cwmagee Oh! I hadn’t heard that. I’ll have to do some - wait for it - digging.
1	@mikamckinnon Canada is second biggest producer of nickel  due to Sudbury asteroid impact site. Close?
1	The opening shot of this video is worth the effort by itself. But it also has my friend @AmyMainzer in it!  https://t.co/4ZebKoTM5X
1	My friends @tweetsoutloud &amp; @rileah have a new science show coming to #ComicConHQ TV!   https://t.co/oA1IwvplyV
-1	@starstryder It may have 12x the caffeine of its American counterpart. I had coffee in Madrid in 1998 and I still have trouble sleeping.
-1	5/5 And I corrected the Tycho post:   https://t.co/0PcCaqZaYs  Thanks to @PeterDEdmonds for pointing out my mistake!
1	@PeterDEdmonds Oh  I make my share. Usually momentary brain clouds  like that one. :) A 5-part tweet correction follows…
1	@PeterDEdmonds AAAARRRRRGGGGGGG! You’re right of course. I’ll fix it.
1	@SOdendahl @LRO_NASA @NASAGoddard Don't I know it. I have a long history with LRO. I was on 2 EPO proposals for it. :)
1	@starstryder Good.
1	@AmandaSchull @EmilyHampshire_ It's not like she's on two really good tv shows and has other things to do.
1	@coreyspowell @RonBaalke @RPappalardo Yeah  it's weird. Like a Little Planet photo.
1	@AmandaSchull @jakeloskutoff Cooooooool.
1	@RobertPicardo Kliban is my favorite cartoonist of all time. I have all his books. Between him and Gahan Wilson they molded my humor.
1	@geoffnotkin Thanks Geoff!
1	@AmandaSchull You’re doing great  Amanda. Now give us a tour of your kitchen! :) #AskAmanda
1	My friend @AmandaSchull from #12Monkeys is live on Periscope!  https://t.co/Mva05vcH7f
1	@tamarakrinsky @CaraSantaMaria @Celestron @tarynoneill Wow  nice ‘scope!
1	@markmccaughrean Well  dang. Now I want to go and hear you al!
1	@markmccaughrean @fedcon I love that cons are doing more science panels and talks. It’s a great time to be a scientist/fan. :)
-1	@EmilyHampshire_ @qkuc @AmandaSchull @12MonkeysSyfy I’ve seen them both together and spacetime survived  but my own continuum was shaken.
1	@AmandaSchull Sure. I suspect I won’t be alone though. :)
-1	@Ksnickers @4steroidboy Actually  yes they do. They appear to switch directions roughly twice per orbit as they round the Sun from our view.
1	@RonBaalke Nearby Cosmic Colliders 1701? // cc @wilw
1	@BeckePhysics That’s pretty!
1	@ThierryLegault @FakeAstropix @Astroguyz @XavierJubier  Video is private. :)
1	@DrMRFrancis They am what they am.
1	@tacticalskyguy @SantaBarbaraAU @earthskyscience @exploreplanets Well that’s cool!
-1	@aiki14 MESSENGER crashed into Mercury’s surface in 2015  so no. :/
1	@aztec_again Thanks!
1	@Cosmicstrenght @rickloverd Ha! Just like “Mission to Mars”. :)
-1	@SungrazerComets @esa @NASA Mercury cosplaying as a dead pixel.
1	@SungrazerComets @esa @NASA That never would have occurred to me  but it’s obvious in retrospect. Also &lt;1% illuminated. :)
-1	@AaronAStanford @AmandaSchull @Iron_Man @12MonkeysSyfy Ahem. &lt;nervously runs finger around collar&gt;
1	@spasmunkey @astro_reid @Msuraev Wow  nice!

-1	.@PC0101 this would be a bad day- ascent abort or emergency landing that couldn't make a land site
1	@beebearninja @nasa_astronauts good idea- except these machines run Linux!
1	@angelitakiz no  mai :)
1	@angelitakiz buon compleanno! Augurio assolutamente "spintaneo" ;)
1	@frankthequeen @AstroTerry @TheRealBuzz @Buzzs_xtina I've been married to one for 13 years.
1	@Thom_astro @astro_timpeake @Astro_Alex @Astro_Andreas it's gotta be 'Los Shenanigos'...
1	@angelitakiz @wireditalia non ancora
1	@Schhh_silenzio contento lei. Buona vita!
1	@Schhh_silenzio lei non cerca una conversazione ma una conferma di quello che lei già crede sia 'verità'. Grazie dell'interesse  buona vita!
1	@Schhh_silenzio un chiarimento: le foto dalla ISS vengono scaricate tutte allo stesso modo  indipendentemente da chi ha scattato la foto.
1	@Schhh_silenzio https://t.co/ugc6TCpWzR
1	@Schhh_silenzio https://t.co/swKI8naP9P
1	@Schhh_silenzio se lei già trovato la sua verità (qualunque essa sia) ed è sordo a qualsiasi spiegazione  perché continua a farmi domande??
1	@Schhh_silenzio no: le foto su FB sono jpeg per comodità. Il formato originale è scaricabile sul sito Nasa. Con tutti i dati.
1	@Schhh_silenzio caro silenzio  tutti i metadati sono rintracciabili sul sito della Nasa. Altro che google.
1	@Schhh_silenzio forse cerca nel posto sbagliato. Sicuramente non è su internet. La verità costa fatica e anni di studi. Quelli seri  però.
1	@Schhh_silenzio lente da 400mm. O complotto? Caro sig. Silenzio  devo ammettere che lei ha un profilo che non invita al dialogo! :)
1	@Schhh_silenzio @terraviewru nella mia foto ci sono le nuvole.
1	@Schhh_silenzio non sono dott. e non è ISS ma varie possibilità 1) docking 2) accensione motori 3) volo parabolico 4) complotto :)
1	@Schhh_silenzio @Astro_DavidS quindi complotto? :) I cavi si vedono anche nel segmento successivo  si sono spostati in basso.
1	@Schhh_silenzio @Astro_DavidS  in quella a sinistra c'è un braccio.
1	@t_aucone @angelitakiz meglio dell'alternativa.
1	@angelitakiz perché non dovrei confermare? Certo che sì.
1	@angelitakiz scusa ma non sono sicuro di cosa stiamo parlando.
1	@angelitakiz ?
1	@angelitakiz Yes
1	@fabriziolab @_la_flaca @zerocalcare tipo

1	@norby80 sono sempre in viaggio ;)
1	@angelitakiz batterie.
1	@angelitakiz b
1	@gheghyxx @7rosaWP lo sport è anche questo. L'importante è dare tutto. Anzi: è l'unica cosa che conta.
1	@angelitakiz l'ho provato  un trimestre  da studente di liceo.
1	@Tungsten_Flight you got me! I was instructing a new CapCom :)
1	@SpaceLauren @Astro_Clay it's plenty interesting for an Italian! Gold and Bronze!!!!!
1	@angelitakiz @Space_Station @NASA_Johnson no
1	@deepbluedot anytime :)
1	@Nanakulikane4 @Rainmaker1973 @Space_Station never
-1	@airandspace however  it deployed correctly. Unused  vented fuel then burned through the risers.
1	@tomenaspda @Rainmaker1973 @Space_Station redocking is always manual.
1	@angelitakiz neanche 1
1	@Ian_Benecken nope  co-sitting as Soyuz expert.
1	@angelitakiz no. Solo radio.
1	@starsmilla no  la missione era prevista così per il primo lancio della nuova Soyuz-TMA- MS
1	@Lindyloo1979 :)
-1	@Lindyloo1979 every time :) not with envy but longing.
1	@angelitakiz ha!
1	@angelitakiz non ne ho proprio idea... ma spero smontata per analisi e test (molto meglio che in un museo...)
1	@vr_doug Always fun to train for an EVA in the virtual reality lab! https://t.co/7lQUX7dF6x

1	@Astro_Clay @nourtra00456201 @DarbyKHOU well  'my' hair didn't grow at all...
1	@angelitakiz Penguin: ne abbiamo sempre 1 a disposizione. Skinsuit: al momento è un esperimento.
1	@CStrable the Force is strong in you  young Padawan. But hold your horses you must  those guys are friendly.
1	@gheghyxx @azzurri certo che do il mio supporto all'Italia! Lo faccio ogni giorno. E che vinca il migliore!
1	@angelitakiz nein. Abbastanza da ordinare la cena.
1	@angelitakiz non mi ricordo più! ;)
1	@Bentisto @astro_timpeake @Thom_astro @AstroSamantha @Astro_Alex @Astro_Andreas @astro_andre this is only for the #shenanigans09

-1	@daylekny @Astro_Clay I disagree: I've answered that question many times!
1	@angelitakiz si va per tempo  non per distanza. Di norma sono programmi specifici  ma si può anche scegliere.
1	@t_aucone sabato
1	@t_aucone no  è una staffetta!
1	@angelitakiz @Tungsten_Flight @Astro_TJ @Astro_Wheels sala simulazioni.
1	@angelitakiz che si vince?
1	@angelitakiz non compilo mai graduatorie.
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	Crew reunion: @Astro_Wheels was Fyodor'CDR  and Fyodor was my CDR on Exp.37. The dog was the mascot on both flights. https://t.co/rtVgxJWDHb
1	@angelitakiz di che??
1	@angelitakiz l'estrazione con capsula sul fianco è più rapida.
1	And @Astro_Wheels at the landing site! https://t.co/kyDHuueIXw
1	@Thom_astro no  I guess for me it's the inverted hairstyle...
1	@Thom_astro sometimes???? You're so lucky! I always end up with the modern equivalent of the Duna...
1	@angelitakiz no
1	@paganforge @ISS_Research among other things  yes
1	@angelitakiz @Frabodum al momento  è più il suono di un'elica ad accompagnarmi!
1	@gloriagraizzaro Mario Runco  astronauta NASA italoamericano.
1	@angelitakiz no  qui non è tradizione...
1	@angelitakiz domanda 'interessata'? Comunque sì  l'esa poi me la gira.
1	@angelitakiz 5
1	@isapinza not nostalgic: I'd rather be happy for the Tims :)
1	@88_insaf @esaoperations as soon as they let me! :)
1	@angelitakiz @esaoperations @astro_tim i nominativi sono EV1 e EV2
1	@angelitakiz @esaoperations molto! Un'emozione condivisa si moltiplica
1	@Ian_Benecken @esaoperations @ESA_EAC @astro_timpeake 1) Great 2) same for me 3) 'have fun!'
1	@astro_timpeake @Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas @Astro_Alex @AstroSamantha yet another self shenanigan for Tim! You  sir  are unsurpassable.
1	@angelitakiz ha!
1	@t_aucone il sistema di controllo ha iniziato la frenata automaticamente. Non è la prima volta. Il docking manuale è comunque previsto.
1	@NASASpaceflight @desolatemoon not exactly. That's for Progress manual docking.
1	@AstronautAbby @NASA @nasahqphoto @Space_Station @astro_timpeake @astro_tim @fka_roscosmos so do I! :)
1	@angelitakiz non credo: Twitter era ancora... giovane.
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@angelitakiz purtroppo non potrò. Lo seguirò via web.
1	@angelitakiz @panorama_it grazie di averla trovata e pubblicata.
1	@Thom_astro touché.
1	@ShuttleAlmanac @Ryazanskiy_ISS @AstroKarenN I have...
1	@angelitakiz @Linkiesta ha!
1	@Astro_Clay doing great! :)
1	@Astro_Clay just don't mix apple  and blackberries. I hear they don't go well together...
1	@angelitakiz ;)
1	@jehldavid totally  thanks for asking :)
1	Hey @Astro_Wheels  I'm POCC support! Glad to be here bright and early :)
1	@t_aucone chi lo sa?
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@LiNa8294 @astro_timpeake @Astro_Alex @Astro_Andreas @Thom_astro @LeoDiCaprio totally!
1	@t_aucone @AlePagliolico credo (e spero) di provare altre emozioni.
-1	@Thom_astro look at those guns...
1	@starsmilla a me? A me!
1	@aliceaguiar @ESA_History @esa @ESA_Italia @ASI_spazio @ItalianAirForce happy b-day!
1	@angelitakiz mi sono già arreso :). Però la foto è davvero sgranata!
1	@angelitakiz spiacente. Non sono io. Non porto mai cappelli  e sono arrivato circa 2' dopo. Ma se ti fa piacere puoi pensare che sia io :)
1	@angelitakiz carina la foto. Ma non sono io!
1	@t_aucone non c'è una regola precisa  ma di sicuro l'impatto è diverso.
1	@gloriagraizzaro @ReefBase @NASA_NEEMO @FIU hanno grande potenziale
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas which of the 3 kinds of cheese?
1	@answerpc usually we're referring  to surface temperature.
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@DrSamStrauss we're out!
1	@chat2u2 both
1	@SchmoopyWoopy barra- barracuda
1	@devilman231170 @angelitakiz non sono paragonabili. Due magnifiche esperienze  assolutamente diverse.
1	@angelitakiz per oggi? Sì. :)
1	@DrSamStrauss Thanks Doc. It's quite an experience  and I'm loving every second of it.
1	@DrSamStrauss of course I do! But I haven't been assigned to an ISS expedition. Hence the "?"
1	@DrSamStrauss ?
1	@BugnrugGrant not really. We depend on the surface supply.
1	@ZMelkes My blog is already in english
1	@Ian_Benecken :)
-1	@Thom_astro yes  it's to make you feel guilty about eating chocolate pudding cake.
1	@t_aucone chi ha detto che sia successo? :)
1	@angelitakiz !
1	@chat2u2 @Rainmaker1973 @nasahqphoto @astro_timpeake @Astro_Andreas yes they did. A bright orange/red flash.
1	@PC0101 There was no external support in my book.
1	@angelitakiz no
1	@Nunziellabiv @t_aucone sì
1	@t_aucone sì. Di norma  il limite è considerato di 210 giorni.
1	@LiNa8294 @Thom_astro @TomCruiseSite yup!
1	@albiondumsday yes they did. The official report should be available.
1	@Thom_astro @NASA_Astronauts @esa good idea. Wrong glasses :)
1	@SP3QFE @AstroKarenN but of course at work  in the best of workplaces
1	@CltOff @angelitakiz sì
1	@LiNa8294 I sure do!
1	@t_aucone purtroppo no.
1	@angelitakiz :D
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@t_aucone no
1	@angelitakiz :)
-1	@angelitakiz ... il problema è che se ci penso mi vengono in mente le parole...
1	@Rainmaker1973 non l'ho mai visto a bordo!
1	@t_aucone dipende  ma in generale sì
1	@AstronautAbby @pblaauw not really
1	@AstronautAbby i know that guy in the background
1	@angelitakiz come tutto  anche il temporale nasce  vive  muore. E lascia un ricordo. http://t.co/wGs3SqeNu8
1	@angelitakiz da brivido!
1	@angelitakiz eh sì... ;)
1	@angelitakiz per riposarsi ci sarà sempre tempo dopo. Molto dopo :)

-1	@Astro_Andreas @ESA_EAC medieval torture. No doubts.
1	@angelitakiz Magari. C'è la fai in 140 caratteri? :)
1	@VoicesFromL5 @AstronautAbby @ToysInTheDryer all the time. It's not different at all.
1	@AstronautAbby @VoicesFromL5 @ToysInTheDryer yes  it was lower. As was the heartbeat.
1	@Astro_Melissa @AstronautAbby I have not heard about it yet...
1	@angelitakiz 1 piano di scale  fatto 3 volte  più vari giri per le stanze... oggi record sui 50m.
1	@Isabellina26 @t_aucone lo guardavo a bordo mentre correvo sul T2
1	@Rainmaker1973 @TeoBrex @AstroSamantha io sono pronto!
1	@angelitakiz dovrebbe esserlo ogni giorno...
1	@angelitakiz mai vergognarsi di essere felici
1	@MasaCritit @AstroTerry @Astro_Nicole no
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@angelitakiz magari altrove
1	@angelitakiz ma dove le trovi? :)
1	@Rainmaker1973 a proteggere il Payload dietro.
1	@t_aucone o la mia incontrando voi? ;)
1	@Astro_Melissa @AstroSamantha @esa @ESA_Italia @Paxi_ESAKids @AstronautAbby @Space_Station moltissimo :)
1	@angelitakiz a me basta che sia sereno. E non mi riferisco alle condizioni meteorologiche :)
1	@AstroDolce @Isabellina26 @camurriusa @TeoBrex @Ma_Te_No @annamazzoleni @pinodifeo @frazsazsa @Maryanne77S @gloriagraizzaro @alexZalex_ HA!
1	@Rainmaker1973 no  non lo è
1	@t_aucone succede
1	@angelitakiz un po' ovunque
1	@frazsazsa @LiNa8294 @Thom_astro @astro_timpeake you don't want to know. Really  you don't.
1	@LiNa8294 @Thom_astro actually  we are 2/3 of the world famous guitar+voice trio 'Los Shenanigos'. @astro_timpeake being the 3/3.
1	@Thom_astro @ESA_Italia @ESA_fr moi  je dirais italo-française ;)
1	@Max_Bellisario @AstronautAbby not yet. But it's on my 'to do' list
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@t_aucone no  sono le stesse che abbiamo all'interno.
1	@dolcestrega09 @b0yle @MarsOneProject http://t.co/k2V5OKDqjk
1	@angelitakiz qualche modella in bikini?
1	@ployd01 @Rainmaker1973 dipende dal tipo di intervento. Non tutto si può fare con CanadArm2
1	@Rainmaker1973 un RPCM (Remote Power Control Module)
1	@Rainmaker1973 è un cavo elettrico
1	@Astro_Wheels must be partly Italian!
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@Rainmaker1973 sì
1	@t_aucone sì
1	@angelitakiz letto tutto :)
1	@AstronautAbby ...
1	@Astro_Clay concur 100%. :)
1	@angelitakiz @CNNindonesia da leggere ad alta voce. :)
1	@angelitakiz @repubblicait perché siamo anche noi umani - non zanzare.
1	@angelitakiz ha! Bellissima...
1	@DCirioni_AVDA @AstroSamantha sì!
1	@Rainmaker1973 per me  sì. Alla fine del 2016 avremo volato tutti.
1	@therealdjflux hello there. Did not recognise you without the helmet.
1	@Thom_astro @cpamoa @lionelferra what?? No SaucISSe? Oh man...
1	@Rainmaker1973 stesso esperimento - diverso modulo.
1	@t_aucone è una revisione delle procedure per @AstroSamantha - quindi né pre né post ma... durante
1	@angelitakiz piuttosto un 'professore associato' ...
1	@angelitakiz direi di si. Se vai in vacanza...
1	@angelitakiz però risparmiamo sull'mp3 player
1	@t_aucone @argotec_it non lo so ancora
1	@LiNa8294 @Thom_astro you'd be the only one who loves it :)
1	@dolcestrega09 @Astro_Cats @tenpixels @Space_Station @NASA_Johnson it felt just like on earth :)
1	@Astro_Cats @tenpixels @Space_Station @NASA_Johnson yup. You saw it.
1	Great to train with @Thom_astro :). Here we're familiarising with hardware for our next NBL dive. #Shenanigans09 #EVA http://t.co/6b2Mh0mCdl

1	@Astro_Clay surely. Let me know when you're going.
1	@Astro_Clay no way! Where's my free phone? ;)
1	@AstronautOmnia @JoyBellart @Cmdr_Hadfield @Thom_astro there's one guitar  a keyboard and smaller stuff...
1	@angelitakiz totem?
1	@angelitakiz :) oggi niente problemi.
1	@angelitakiz anche io.
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@AstronautAbby @NASA_Johnson I can relate...

1	@gelidomattino @Astro_Nicole @ObservingSpace in LEO  we're protected by the magnetosphere.
1	@Thom_astro bon Noël et joyeux 2015!
1	@t_aucone già fatto :)
1	@angelitakiz non amo le definizioni. In generale.
1	@t_aucone @AstroSamantha si...
1	@BIS_spaceflight i hope so
1	@angelitakiz ?
1	@t_aucone @AstroSamantha no  purtroppo
1	@angelitakiz se necessario  torna a sognare per raddrizzarla.
1	@t_aucone una copia
1	@Thom_astro @astro_timpeake @Astro_Alex @Astro_Andreas ha! You got me there...
1	@bamamapop @cristinafaloci @t_aucone @Radio3scienza @Radio3tweet :)
1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@t_aucone @IT2014EU perché ho chiesto io a @fabfazio di scriverla ed è stato incredibilmente cortese a farlo in pochissimo tempo :)
1	@angelitakiz la risposta è giusta solo per chi la interpreta.
1	@angelitakiz quello che non ho scritto è che si può scegliere di non rispondere ;)
1	@Isabellina26 @OoyenSimone @kikkiar @camurriusa @dolcestrega09 @t_aucone :)
1	@angelitakiz perché mettere limiti al possibile?
1	@MarilPitt @t_aucone si
1	@t_aucone @chetempochefa se va tutto bene sarò presente anche fisicamente:$
1	@Thom_astro @NASA_Johnson hey  if I remember correctly  spinning is prohibited on a T38! #readthe-1 ;)
1	@angelitakiz divertente
1	@ployd01 @t_aucone @ESA_CAVES si  confermo  un sistema radio molto particolare.
1	@gloriagraizzaro grazie a te!
1	@angelitakiz non lo sapevo neanche io. :)
1	@CraftLass 'a tale of two cities'? :)
1	@govi47 Lo spero proprio: 38 anni (appena compiuti) è presto per la pensione!
1	@angelitakiz e infatti  non ci sono attori in 'italy in a day'
1	@devilman231170 @DCirioni_AVDA @frazsazsa @LucianaLittizze @fabfazio la risposta ufficiale sarebbe 1.86... al risveglio  almeno :)
1	@gloriagraizzaro @frazsazsa ma grazie a voi!
-1	@SP3QFE I'll be travelling  unfortunately
1	@angelitakiz ;)
1	@AstronautAbby @AirLawInstitute amazing!!

1	@angelitakiz :)
1	@angelitakiz buonqualsiasimomento ;)
1	@angelitakiz @IT2014EU certamente. E di una cosa ancora più importante: il sogno.
1	@angelitakiz oui!
1	@PC0101 @Cesare582 confermo tutto :)

1	@Crassall me too.
1	@SelfExamineLife @tigerduck bingo!
1	@TakeThatHistory don't know.. frankly
1	@dcastelvecchi  that is classical Gravity acting on quantum states of matter. Different.
1	@Klekociuk thanks. Not in oz then.
1	@CMacauley82 @TIFF_NET thank you
1	@paul_kramarchyk @TIFF_NET yes. Am lucky
1	@ericschupper will try.
1	@L0Jim no.. it was study curiosity..  two things he lacks.
1	@JonPaulSapsford been there. Like it there.
1	@TheTXFlash it is fascinating to me to read the responses. Very educational.
1	@TheTXFlash me too
1	@Christ21cent @myles_barr speak for yourself.
1	@atime4truth @Sillymidoff49 yup it does.. end of discussion
1	@atime4truth @CaptainAhabTX @Sillymidoff49 look at the universe
1	@atime4truth @Sillymidoff49 all fossil evidence supports evolution. Hundreds of predictions verified. None of biology makes sense without it
1	@TheTXFlash @irony3glink @realDonaldTrump only a set of measure zero in the multiverse.
1	@TheTXFlash @irony3glink @realDonaldTrump exactly. And it isn't 10 billion. We know that because he says it is. :)
1	@wgpnta @BakareDlaw hold on to it tight.
1	@Perdnoot @AtyHans @neiltyson agreed gravitational waves the key.
1	@wgpnta @BakareDlaw have fun
1	@KevinOnEarth even then I don't get it. The athletes represent themselves.
1	@Mariposaland @hackenslash1 just as bad.. :)
1	@Christ21cent @Mariposaland yeah no joke. More like a nightmare.
1	@iva_987 @arizonapbs yes.. we had a moment of silence for him or her
1	@omcintyre @ASUOrigins yes. I believe so.. and a produced version archived for later appearance on the web.
1	@Christ21cent @Mariposaland rather focus on life
1	@benjiderooij thanks
1	@iva_987 yes. At least I could comment on the proposed design.
1	@iva_987 thanks!  Good to hear. Thanks.
1	@hugorealtor there will be.
1	@iva_987 not yet  I guess.. maybe after sept. premiere in Toronto.

1	@TehFalker @BishanChakrabor @SolarthWoW agree!
1	@784578GGBATski @RichardDawkins @ASUOrigins @carlzimmer @pickover @bgzimmer @BillKristol thanks.
1	@wagnerfilm yes  but regardless of that  the statement Paul made of his relationship with him  an mine for that matter is true.
1	@ClayFerguson @AnnieDanz since the original replicator was probably rna you should stop pontificating.
1	@TheFaithslayer this isn't panspermia directly.. just an assist.
1	@AstroAlex73 thank you.
1	@oubey thanks!
1	@DavidBflower @MohamedofShaban thanks
1	@RobertLouisr @TheFaithslayer no one knows what his real views of any of these issues is.
1	@TamiHoshiyama keep working on that. You will get it eventually.
1	@SonsOfHitches thanks

1	@michaelaranger very unlikely.
1	@iva_987 :)
1	@debbiebere thanks.. I have.. :)
-1	@Daz555 @couriermail less no federal case would have been made. stern reprimand and warning.. with no requirement to fly back to OZ for case
1	@PhilMorey1 good point! :)
1	@SchitCunce yes agree.... but no fine.. just bond.
1	@Crassall not what the evidence in court suggested.
-1	@michaelaranger @BernieSanders @Pontifex visit a cathedral. And think of the tax dollars stolen.
-1	An old @bigthink video of absurdity of teaching creationism recently resurfaced. Relevant in this election year.  https://t.co/U32JWfJyoZ
1	@stren000 yes
-1	@godFreeWorld @RJDownard I agree..  was disappointed that they asked him to be a part of it after I agreed.
1	@LenFisherScienc thanks.
1	@shaihulud @StarTrek thank you
1	Lots of fun tonight @ConwayHall. Great crowd and first time I have talked about LIGO and early universe. Thanks @howtoacademy
1	@michaelaranger a big one.
-1	Off to UK and Norway tomorrow @howtoacademy Mar 2-London  Mar 5  Trondheim Norway--both sold out alas. Back Mar 12  @asu with Johnny Depp.
1	@Crassall knowledge
1	@LenFisherScienc @arizonapbs my ebs number is 7
1	@NoScience4War so  what is the answer?  :)
1	@ProfMike_M @tiffcervantes @Mariposaland did you read my New Yorker piece on Carson?
1	@DrMRFrancis @ProfMike_M I won't.. just mentioned big excitement..
1	@ProfMike_M p.s. just saw @DrMRFrancis original tweet and that might have given it away to me too :) Happily no torrent this time.
1	@AstroKatie @mcnees absolutely!.. but am impressed by LIGO so far.. so let's hope for the best.
1	@mcnees agree. But let's all watch it.
1	@ProfMike_M first heard about this 3 days ago from journalist but waited for firm confirmation and also that news was out. Got that today.
1	@ProfMike_M yes. agree. After 4 calls from journalists and assurance from responsible journal that was already known figured ok. Maybe not
1	@ProfMike_M was told by the reputable journal that contacted me that it had already been announced online in several places.
1	@ProfMike_M actually waited till it had already been announced elsewhere.
1	@ProfMike_M don't understand. Media will be at press conference.
1	@ProfMike_M @DrMRFrancis wow.. don't you think it is worth letting people know there will be a press conference?
1	@ProfMike_M it produced articles about grav. waves and prepared reporters who have called to express thanks.. not worth discussing anymore
1	@iva_987 don't know.. may premiere at Cannes.. can't wait to find out.
1	@iva_987 just saw this.  :)
1	@wotanhus @ProfMike_M yes
1	@croftandi nothing
1	@dcastelvecchi @WIREDScience thanks.
1	@Crassall thanks.
1	@ProfMike_M last time I mentioned possibility what it did was produce articles about gravitational waves  which was what I hoped for.
1	@ProfMike_M I don't think there is much glory in alerting people to the possibility. Don't worry. If true they will deservedly get glory.
1	@ProfMike_M @alliomack @Crassall @kizolk I think alerting public to the possible discovery they should watch for and be excited about is ok
1	@ProfMike_M @kizolk they'll get the credit  don't worry.
1	@ATHE1STP0WER @aabel718 @vsaluki @GlenSteen @GodlessUtopia we measure their gravitational effects.
1	@VergaraLautaro ushuaia.. argentina
1	@thebanite thanks.
-1	@stren000 @WarmZeke not good to come out during presidential election.
1	@iva_987 it's hard for me too!
1	@iva_987 @wickedsweetcake congrats!  :)
1	@iva_987 will check with my assistant.
1	@iva_987 ?
1	@iva_987 yes.. but I live in the US and also have US citizenship
1	@WilliamAltoft @BillNye @Ehmee @neiltyson @guardianscience nicely done.
1	@JackManhire @nature @NatureNews nothing new to report
1	@iva_987 thanks.
1	@hula_clay great!

1	@iva_987 thx.
1	@lyndalovon @NewYorker read the piece.
1	@MPCmonkey @RichardDawkins thanks
1	@danfalk thanks Dan
1	@NathanaelStCyr @Colossis2 @magguu_ yes  it is difficult  but that is why they are judges  and shouldn't be elected.  :)
1	@ImaginaryTime thanks

1	@jared_grierson @bigthink I have
1	@LenFisherScienc @QandA good points.
1	@michaelaranger try my last book

1	@sachi_bbsr Perhaps not at this moment (just about over Africa right now)  but we were at 7:39 GMT this morning when I took this picture!
1	@cosmos4u I mean the Milky Way!  Haven't seen it yet on this mission. But remember it being so striking!
1	@Ian_Benecken Yes  we are watching. Mission Control Houston is up-linking it live.
1	@I_We_Gaia He figured it out - I took the pictures. I did tell him how to end the stitches though. =)
1	My pleasure! MT @NASAJSCStudents We wanted to thank @AstroKarenN for taking time out her day to talk to us last week! http://t.co/JZOLl8xzQp

1	@cnni Thanks everyone for the great #CNNspacechat questions. Glad you could join me for a short time on #ISS!
1	@deanbain1 No. We can use iPods provided (w/ our music). Use internet protocol phone for calling family &amp; friends.
1	What a team! Proud of friends in space &amp; team on earth for pulling off an amazing EVA. @AstroMarshburn @Cmdr_Hadfield @Carbon_Flight
1	@PC0101 Yes  they are in Russian - as we fly the Soyuz. No separate language exam.
1	@vr_doug @astro_luca Wow. That's amazing! We'll get a pic for you to compare.

1	@mikamckinnon Field work on the lava flows in Hawaii. Sea kayaking in Orcas Islands.
1	@mikamckinnon Wow some great pics that bring back lots of memories.
1	@Astro_Clay Cool shot! https://t.co/Cpbe11acyZ
1	@mikamckinnon Wow you worked on Stargate! I'm a huge fan. NBL runs just below surface of water were like looking at event horizon.
1	@andreaatnpj @Nature_NPJ message me on Monday
1	@andreaatnpj @Nature_NPJ I will be at the ISS conference next week in SD. So if that is what #ISSRDC is then sure.
1	@502SpaceXfan #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts No privacy. Very little room in capsule and hab module. Like 3 folks in small car.
1	@adcunningham #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts It jolts you forward since go from high G's to zero G's in milliseconds
1	@lsullivan @Space_Station #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Probably the 6 hours done by several crews.
1	@JulieHarden @elsie_see @Space_Station @NASA_Astronauts Not much. It has cargo but enough to remove suit.
1	@adcunningham #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts The ride home is like being a shoe in a dryer. it is wild.
1	@adcunningham #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts I was lucky and was at ISS in 6 hours.  Faster is better.
1	@adcunningham #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts The one I happen to be flying on at the time.  I flew Endeavour  Discovery  Atlantis.
1	@adcunningham @Astro_Kate7 @Space_Station @NASA #askNASA The ride will be the same but some improved systems will be used.
1	@MelissaHasBooks #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Normal trip always been 2 days so no changes needed. 6 hours is just better trajec
1	@HMS4824FAN @Space_Station @NASA_Astronauts #askNASA Use sleeping bags in capsule and small hab module.
1	@JulieHarden @Space_Station Wiki has good general description. New one looks same mostly. https://t.co/Q8VLoeqUXN
1	@JulieHarden #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Since this newer model Soyuz they want to check out systems before docking. Test drive
1	@rubeneo2014 #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts A cooling unit. Suits are very hot since the material doesn't breath
1	@hyperbola1 #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Both dock 2 ISS but launch from diff places means different trajectory but same result
-1	@Monkeymafia1668 Moon landings are real.  Take some engineering classes and you'll learn that it is easier to go to moon than fake it.
-1	@hyperbola1 #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Only 8.5 minutes to achieve orbit around the Earth. 2 days to chase down ISS.
1	@Monkeymafia1668 We train in pool but fly in space. Water bubbles form in space if water leaks.
1	@hyperbola1 #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts G's climb slowly but reach as high as 3 or more.
1	@502SpaceXfan #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts RP-1 and LOX I believe.
1	@Monkeymafia1668 Go outside into a yard and point camera down
1	@JohnD_Love #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts No. Once in zero-G they can float in very small volume of capsule and living module.
1	@rubeneo2014 @Space_Station @NASA_Astronauts #AskNASA ONe they reach orbit they can float out of their seats into a small volume.
1	@jean_labbe @Space_Station Search the internet for track the ISS. You will be able to put in your area and it will tell you exactly.
1	@rubeneo2014 #AskNASA @space_station @NASA_astronauts Soyuz has small toilet and sleeping bags. A very small volume
1	@Rick5oh Absolutely.  They are constantly upgrading it and this is the latest version.
1	@Evhorizon @Astro_Clay Just like at home. On Station we turn the lights off when we go to bed and turn them on when we wake up.
1	@NateZoellner @HumanoidHistory @Astro_Clay My guess is humans Orbiting Mars around 2030 to 35 and landing 5 or 10 years later.

1	I think I am going to be on BBC Radio 5 @bbc5live in 5 or 10 minutes to talk about @OSIRISREx... https://t.co/XWWHZpTMvI
-1	Scott Messer: "The engineers were fighting with one another about who could be the most nominal." Those nutty engineers. @OSIRISREx
1	Dante Lauretta: "Y'all will be really glad to know we got everything exactly perfect." @OSIRISREx
1	Jim Green: "What's going to happen after the samples come back will be decades of study." @OSIRISREx
1	OSIRIS-REx is on its own now. Get those solar panels open and talk to @CanberraDSN please...
1	Centaur has begun to despin in preparation for spacecraft separation @OSIRISREx
1	The 15 minute coast is to make sure that good old reliable @CanberraDSN will be able to talk to the spacecraft during separation.
-1	I won't relax until I know @OSIRISREx is generating solar power and communicating with Earth. Within an hour (hopefully) we'll know.
1	Everything continues fine for @OSIRISREx . Still waiting for 2nd Centaur burn  then spacecraft separation &amp; solar panel deploy
1	Release! LOOKS GOOD WE ARE GOING TO SPACE TODAY @OSIRISREx
1	T minus 4 minutes AND COUNTING Y'ALL @OSIRISREx
1	.@OSIRISREx "Launch on time verified." "solar radiation acceptable for launch." "all steps are complete prior to status check."
1	.@OSIRISREx spacecraft is now on internal power.
1	The final hold is a good time to tune in  because you'll get to listen another cool prelaunch poll https://t.co/yVbbgACKeI @OSIRISREx
1	T minus 4 minutes and holding. @OSIRISREx
1	Atlas and Centaur are reporting their loads of liquid oxygen and hydrogen are at flight levels -- they're ready to fly. @OSIRISREx
1	.@OSIRISREx will be NASA's first planetary mission launched since MAVEN in 2013  and the last until InSight in 2018.
1	It's T minus 10 minutes now  but there's a built-in 15-minute hold at T minus 4  so we're 25 minutes from @OSIRISREx launch.
1	1 hour from scheduled @OSIRISREx launch!
1	The NASA TV "public" and "media" feeds seem to be identical -- hope we get to listen to clean comm audio as @osirisrex launch approaches
1	Follow @SpaceflightNow and @S101_Live for the nitty gritty details on @OSIRISREx launch preparations. https://t.co/h1BfUAhZ1N
1	.@OSIRISREx could launch as early as 23:05 UTC; today's launch window is ~2 hours long  with launch opportunities every 5 minutes.
1	.@OSIRISREx countdown restarting at 2050 UTC. There'll be one more built-in hold in the countdown  at 4 minutes prior to launch.
1	Propulsion "ready" hydraulics "ready" pneumatics "ready" ... I loooooove the launch polls @OSIRISREx
1	NASA TV broadcast of @OSIRISREx launch coverage has started. Launch scheduled in ~2.5 hours. https://t.co/qO85RUH5E1
-1	For questions about the @OSIRISREx mission  its timeline  goals  and instruments  check the @NASA press kit (PDF): https://t.co/OCSo8hWI9m
1	I've translated the launch-relative times from the @ulalaunch booklet into EDT  PDT  UTC for nominal launch time: https://t.co/kTDEqOKtxd
1	OMG these are adorable // cc @startorialist  https://t.co/pd2IP0XeZ1
1	@NASASpaceflight @SciGuySpace Watch this thread for people working on the JunoCam data: https://t.co/adaOsE1iAH
1	@NASASpaceflight They've been posted! https://t.co/5HQ3b89IYB https://t.co/WuTRniArby
1	@IBJIYONGI We can bring the book to attention of @AmSciMag editors @JLVernonPhD @coreyspowell @fenellasaunders :) https://t.co/Sxb8v5hH04
1	@tanyaofmars WOOOO that's like official and stuff
1	@tedstryk it's in the same location as the previous ones  https://t.co/wkooyM5lQ2 or you can use my raws page
1	@mirikramer A mix of hot pixels  CR hits  &amp; stars. One of the teeny dots is outer moon Siarnaq  too small to resolve https://t.co/CfYl0fZnyS
1	@AstroCook @verbiscer Looks like Quaoar would be a pretty great target for several reasons  actually. *sigh*
1	@ledahulevogyre @OlafFrohn Thank you for pointing that out -- I've fixed the problem.
1	@AstroCook @verbiscer @NASA @NASANewHorizons Cosign!
-1	@mirikramer @RachelFeltman @NASA @NASANewHorizons Sadly  people's lack of familiarity with the cool worlds of the KB makes that unlikely.
1	@aussiastronomer yep.
1	@masequeira1 but it's kind of a cop-out to do that with an omnipotent character.
1	@masequeira1 I think maybe people enjoy the episodes because Picard is ordinarily so collected; they enjoy seeing him tested &amp; frustrated.
1	@masequeira1 I really enjoy DeLancie's acting so I think they're fun but I don't like the character's omnipotence so think stories are weak.
1	@tedstryk I get now why it's appropriate to include it but it took a lot of work with various data sets to see it that way.
1	@tedstryk That's not surprising  I used to leave out MVIC in things like this too  lumping it with things like VIMS.
-1	@alexwitze I read biographies of Marie Curie and Marie Tharp back-to-back and the contrasts between the two Maries' treatment was :(
1	@AstroKatie @upulie whaaaaat
1	@tedstryk Done and done. Thanks :)
1	@tedstryk Can you email me a PNG? I'll swap it in to my article
1	@tedstryk That looks much nicer -- can't wait for them to release the raw data so you guys can have at it :)
1	@PlanetDr A statement that is probably true about an even larger fraction of planetary science papers :)
1	@PlanetDr This exchange could probably have referred to a substantial fraction of planetary science papers.
1	@megschwamb For science orbits  eventually  yes  but not for PJ1  evidently.
1	@hubbahubble People keep saying "space is something humanity does together" and I'm all "look at NASA panels  it's only part of humanity"
1	@hubbahubble I have been feeling precisely the same since the summer. Took all the joy out of Juno.
1	@tanyaofmars I am  coincidentally  wearing the exact same T-shirt today :)
1	WHOOOOOOO HOOOOOO YAAAAAYYYY TANYAAAAAA! @tanyaofmars  https://t.co/kNKZzpgCLH
1	@tanyaofmars you got this!
1	@starstryder "Mesa" means "table " so think an  elevated area  wide and flat on top  with steep sides.
1	@starstryder In my mind mesas are wider  while buttes are skinnier  but they're overlapping. Ones at Murray are buttes  very skinny at tops.
1	@arielwaldman Yours is first conference I've agreed to speak at where organizers proactively told me the aspect ratio for my slides - thx!

1	@drskyskull @kimberlykowal I need a review copy of this!!
1	@cirquelar When I saw the CME mentioned in reports I literally said "oh  for god's sake" out loud. Like  enough is enough  universe.
1	@erinleeryan @aussiastronomer Dang  I was off  I guessed Joshua Tree.
-1	@CosmicRaymond @mbramble Failure of secondary mirror deployment would doom mission. Could still do some science w/o sunshade  side mirrors
-1	For those of you who missed the informative @OSIRISREx press briefing today  a recording is now available: https://t.co/XAmYIYpV9K
1	@DrMRFrancis Nope. @jasonrdavis will be there.
1	Lauretta: Most exciting thing about any planetary mission is that you're going to a new world. [Cosigned.] @OSIRISREx
1	@OSIRISREx #AskNASA thank you!
1	.@OSIRISREx principal investigator @DSLauretta gives shoutout to Planetary Society for running Bennu naming contest https://t.co/vxvJHPf1vu
1	#askNASA When does instrument commissioning start? Are there plans to photograph Earth on departure? @OSIRISREx
1	The rest of the @OSIRISREx spacecraft has deep heritage from Stardust sample return &amp; MAVEN missions  among others.
1	Rich Kuhns: The TAGSAM sample arm concept began as a solo cup and an air compressor in a driveway :) #gottastartsomewhere @OSIRISREx
1	Lauretta: "We've done a great job convincing ourselves that Bennu has loose material on its surface" ....interesting wording. @OSIRISREx
1	@kejames you are that  too! :)
-1	@musicscott @Pomerantz I have the right skills  but live on the wrong coast.

1	@cirquelar @milkysa you guys may have PhDs but I don't :)
1	@mirikramer Analysis/processing of those images beginning here https://t.co/NM32GAZsTE
1	@mirikramer Yep  by "new" I think they mean "newly released." Archive goes up to Jul 28 as far a I can tell. Part of the "Marble Movie"
1	@RocketCaley @sondy I can strongly recommend pretreating clothes with Permethrin. Saved our family from mosquito bites on trip to India
1	@NewSpaceIndia @sandygrains This August article is just a reprint of one from April  right? https://t.co/atUQqxm3bh
1	@astrotweeps Ha at my small liberal arts college I did my best to take no more than two classes in any one department other than my major :)
1	@markmccaughrean Thanks!
1	@PlanetDr (And then drink wine  obvs)
1	@PlanetDr At some future meeting we need to coordinate and wear them on the same day.
1	Woohoo congratulations @alexwitze for winning @theAGU Perlman award! https://t.co/xfHyAfnguC
-1	@AndrewNCassidy It's a weird thing that iPhone camera software does with low signal-to-noise images - some photos look downright pointilist.
1	@vruba I would publish the heck out of that on the Planetary Society blog :)
1	@PlanetDr @nadiamdrake haha
1	@Alex_Parker @BezPublic @PlanetaryKeri @asrivkin @barbylon @mikeseibert @TheEarthStory OK who has a T-shirt store they can throw that in
1	@kchangnyt @mirikramer @afreedma I had no idea what you were talking about yesterday but now that I know all I can say is mmmm...rocky core.
1	@ageekmom No that is the one from this morning
1	@NASAJPL @NASAJuno @lizlandau @VeronicaMcG Where can I find the JunoCam movie?
1	@ScottWx_TWN That's the version they released this morning  only 1 Io orbit worth.
1	@AstroKatie @BadAstronomer @sondy Hahahaha
1	@LongHairNasaGuy ha that sounds about right!
1	@alexwitze Blarg.
1	@alexwitze Are you having any better luck getting confirmation of spacecraft timeline events where you are than we are?
1	@GeertHub You might be right but I'm not hearing anything -- are you getting any audio on that channel?
1	Next #Juno event expected in ~10 minutes. I have to run off to do @bbc5live interview in meantime...
-1	@kchangnyt @nadiamdrake @alexwitze @RachelFeltman @mirikramer @lorengrush The sad parts are "alone" and "dark" whisky would make all better
1	@mirikramer @alexwitze @RachelFeltman @lorengrush I brought fruit and cheese sticks and granola bars for everybody come ask me!
1	Dear UK insomniacs: I should be on @bbc5live at 3:50.
1	@NovaSilisko @PlanetDr It is the approach movie described in https://t.co/kl4CwpKlP2
1	@PlanetDr I had a fun conversation with Jim Green about how cool these pictures were :)
1	@markmccaughrean @badastronomer Proof: https://t.co/2IOtYyqNRO
1	@markmccaughrean @badastronomer Policy was changed during cruise  before SOI.
1	@markmccaughrean @badastronomer Cassini did it from SOI.
1	@sumnerd @BadAstronomer Cameras were on until 5 days before JOI. They've released 3 processed images  1 processed movie  no raws.
1	@tanyaofmars @BadAstronomer No  they are MARCI-like -- pushframe  a bit challenging to work with  but the amateurs can handle them.
1	[Everybody please direct some love at Madrid  Goldstone  &amp; @CanberraDSN stations for bringing us all our space science &amp; engineering data.]
1	Goldstone will be the prime Deep Space Network station receiving Juno signals tonight  on 5 dishes  with 4 dishes at @CanberraDSN as backup.

-1	@jonny_nichols @BBCAmos @chrislintott I don't have one of those handy water heating teapots  sorry to the Brits!
1	@masequeira1 no  it's much too far away. Spacecraft are only directly observable when they're quite close to Earth.

1	@marsroverdriver @milkysa Please tag me out of this I'm trying to focus on Juno
1	@Econopete @NzRv It's 1/4 scale.
1	@marsroverdriver *Many* kinds of disabilities are addressed by microphones  just as many others are by ramps/elevators.
1	@marsroverdriver You're lucky you don't constantly have to think about managing a disability. World would be kinder if more people did think
1	@marsroverdriver Try to think about the experience of a person constantly in this situation.
-1	@marsroverdriver @michaelaye Guys  look up "cruel". Just because it's not intended cruelty doesn't mean it isn't experienced as cruel
1	@megschwamb @chrislintott that's good to hear!
1	@arielwaldman @tweetsoutloud true but MRO is seriously old. If it's not TGO then it's NASA's telecom orbiter with a HiRISE duplicate.
1	@tweetsoutloud @arielwaldman highly likely to have been @ESA_TGO?
1	@mikamckinnon I bet they did it to replace with an accessible sidewalk ramp  which is a worthy thing to do
1	@PlanetDr @sondy @AstroCook @Alex_Parker eat  drink  and be merry....
-1	@AstroCook @sondy @PlanetDr @Alex_Parker in 2007 Rosetta will be dead and Cassini will die and Juno will be almost over so let's not
1	It appears to be China week at The Planetary Society Blog: China's new rocket and spaceport by @jasonrdavis https://t.co/OWKOX1EgOo
1	@cirquelar haha I was wondering about that. Great graphic :) Really like the different icons for different types of science sites.
1	@mikamckinnon Look at the list of speakers from the gullies workshop @tanyaofmars is attending this week?
1	@sumnerd I like the little bitty MER head on the tippy top of the mast and because that's not high enough they put a UHF antenna on top
-1	@AscendingNode @NovaSilisko AFAIK  Night driving was about low-temperature dry-lubricated motors  a development effort that failed in 2007
1	@starstryder @bug_gwen I literally read this tweet while snacking
1	@Golans_mom I think I may be all set now  but thank you!
-1	@paix120 @kejames this is a sort of embarrassing one  but Crystal Singer  by Anne Macafferey.
1	@PlanetDr Haha I bookmarked one of those when it happened a couple weeks ago :)
1	@mikamckinnon I walked in to a Verizon store and got a basic device that has served me pretty well.
1	@uniquename439 BOOOOOOOOOO
-1	@JPMajor God I dislike that metaphor.
1	@PlanetDr did the @booplefloof s participate in the vigil?
1	@Stephist @NASAJuno I support this line of research
1	@PlanetDr well I can't argue with that.
1	@PlanetDr someone on the internet somewhere is keeping vigil. You go be the best you by sleeping.
-1	@LDMay @JaredEspley maybe this is all part of my secret plan to annihilate excessive acronym use :)
1	@PlanetDr nice  I hadn't seen that one.

1	@PlanetDr Hey  who's the person who taught you about the concept of the "invisible chapter?"
1	@b3ko No  mostly just used NASA's Eyes on the Solar System for 3D views; plus photos taken at NASA Kennedy; and Illustrator to plan it
1	@Econopete Yup.

1	@erichand Congratulations! Also "news that matters to the cognoscenti" lol
-1	@astroengine @StartsWithABang What will *definitely* kill Curiosity  if nothing else does  is the slow decline in RTG power output.
-1	@astroengine @StartsWithABang We may see a grouser on a middle wheel fail soon  which could lead to dramatic increase in damage rate.
1	@astroengine @StartsWithABang That report was mine :) I guess it's time for an update  to clarify misunderstandings.
-1	@StartsWithABang Rate of damage has slowed dramatically  and Mars Yard testing has shown the rover can drive with 2/3 of wheel shredded off.
-1	@StartsWithABang I don't think you can say the wheels will be cause of failure  or that they will prevent the rover from exploring Mt Sharp.

1	@kejames I was once asked to give a keynote talk about space imaging...and the A/V equipment failed. I still gave an awesome talk. So 👍
1	@markmccaughrean They had UV data  which gave them the clouds  which is neat; I just wish they had also released a more realistic view.

1	@AstroRM Sent a great picture ... do you see us?! @NECSS talking with @debbiebere @jeannegarb @biobus #NECSS talking about women in science
1	Ready for takeoff!  For these students- ZeroG science @NASA and job smarts from HR boss @nasapeople @jeribuchholz! http://t.co/1k9wQ7XSAP
1	With @jeribuchholz  -28 students and teachers! @nasapeople is doing science with @nasa_rgefp ! http://t.co/fMMIDTyTSO
1	Why am I talking @NECSS  w “@debbiebere @iIovescience's @Elise_Andrew &amp; @JeanneGarb?  Because there aren't enough women in Science &amp; #STEM!
1	.@DanSpace77 @astro_mike Good things come in small packages - and zero G is a great equalizer!  When it comes to the Soyuz though -I win!
1	@Astro_Wakata @Astro_RM with @AstroRobonaut @SpaceLive : The smiling faces of @ISS_Research #ISS @NASA http://t.co/sS0T1MowCw

1	. @DavidWeaver  @jethrotull We listen to music or see a film because we want to feel a certain way. It is that way for us in space as well!
1	The Good...the Bad... &amp; the Ugliest parts of tomorrow's #ISS #E38 spacewalk.  You'll hear me TELL ALL on @GMA Good Morning America Saturday!
1	Just 4 hr from #Maven launch  1 day from #Minotaur1 launch @NASA_Wallops  6 people living on #ISS doing @ISS_Research.... LIfe is Good.
1	Join @Lori_Garver  @Astraughnomer @SallyRideSci and I for #CelebrateSally Ride for a google hangout to talk about #STEM and YOU!!
1	OK.  We admit it.  @spacemama and I are watching #TakeMeToYourMother again...  @Astro_Nicole cracks us up  and we loved Holly and Dana.
1	@9dognight All of the above!  Lets face it  without these women  and other like them  we'd be NOWHERE!
1	An awesome trio for space trials! @Astro_Wheels @astro_ricky and I tested emergency exit paths for #NASA's @Orion! http://t.co/0oxCWXc4m5
1	Oh  THAT??  Just a little film I did with @GeorgeTakei from @StarTrek and a few of my friends @ItGetsBetter :) http://t.co/ITPdh8NxXu
1	When @Astro_KarenN launches to #ISS  will she watch @Astro_Nicole and I on @NickMom? Will she meet anyone that says #TakeMeToYourMother?!
1	All of us will recognize ourselves in #TakeMeToYourMother!  Later this month  @NickMom visits #NASA with @Astro_Nicole  NASA Moms and I!

1	@spasmunkey Having a day off - but training in Houston tomorrow starting with a fit check of my EVA space boots.  Now THAT's shoe shopping!
1	Follow my training for space via @CNN Counting down Cady vlog: http://is.gd/5wBXs
1	@digitaldraco @starstryder It's a good show!
1	@cirquelar Yep!
-1	Mosquitos! If you can't beat 'em  infect 'em w bacteria that makes 'em way less dangerous hopefully https://t.co/kG058z346R HT @m_m_campbell
1	@mcnees @bwecht *sigh*
1	@canadianjlod @ClimateReality The x-rays aren't the kind of radiation that can significantly affect climate. Very short term effects.
1	@canadianjlod @ClimateReality Solar storms put out small amounts of cosmic rays and x-rays  which are mostly dealt with by the magnetosphere
1	@canadianjlod @ClimateReality @NASA Nope
1	@rolfje Nah  it's really the sort of thing the platform needs to fix. But thanks
-1	@rolfje Is being bombarded by hate speech and being sent intentionally traumatizing imagery part of the "open platform" thing you like?
-1	@rolfje You get a lot of death threats and doxing on here?
1	@DrNeilTyson ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1	@TrueSciPhi I find this kind of analysis absolutely fascinating  even though it always feels a bit like schoolyard gossip
-1	@itsa_talia Your real friends live in Twitter and they would not be so rude as to make you leave the house
-1	@Annaleen 😕 I don't like Halloween either - awful people use it as an excuse to be more awful than usual
1	@amyekimball @j_bellovary Nice!
1	@gargpit Yeah
1	@smenor @NforNihilism I shouldn't pay attention at all. The numbers don't really matter
1	@mpesce @marovdan The data suggest it  but currently need more observations to say definitively
1	@NforNihilism I actually get a lot of followers when I tweet politics  so it wouldn't surprise me if some of them left
1	Here are six different views of the Moon from @LRO_NASA -- we only see the one in the upper left (from… https://t.co/la9Sk6kD0n
1	This visualization of the rotating Moon from @LRO_NASA data is lovely &amp; hypnotic: https://t.co/ucAx9Vnxda (also probably good for insomnia)
1	@methylnick It's so good!
1	@Alex_Parker @cirquelar Yes like that!
1	@AussiePhinatic @KIPAC1 That's kinda hard to say -- depends what you mean by detected/detectable. Evidence for DM in inner galaxy.
-1	@cirquelar I mean the large-scale shape of the universe might be different. For instance  in AdS space  negative curvature.
1	@cirquelar Not necessarily  but possibly -- it's more that the shape of spacetime is different in some of the cases studied.
-1	@cwmagee I think so  because the mathematical machinery it's building could become unbelievably powerful
1	@bwecht @mcnees Like  dark matter &amp; strong CP aren't really separate problems if you have an axion. But should've said "also prolly not TOE"
1	@bwecht @mcnees The few comments I did send were along the lines of "authors aren't crackpots but this isn't as remarkable as it sounds"
1	@mcnees @bwecht  I mean it honestly didn't occur to me that they'd go with a headline saying "solves" without even a qualifier
1	@MJIBrown Hopefully people will check date before rushing outside at least!
1	@mcnees @bwecht I was asked for comment on this study &amp; I didn't have time so I suggested someone else but I kinda wish I'd said something…
1	@GrahamBowes @Space_Station Whoa!!
1	@MJIBrown That was gorgeous -- thanks for the heads-up! :)
1	@JimCriz Oh that one's all right
1	@upulie Also the information that does escape the black hole in that particular theory is unrecognizably scrambled so uh yeah.
-1	Be especially suspicious of images of eclipses  "giant voids in space"  supermoons  &amp; exploding stars. And follow @FakeAstropix &amp; @PicPedant
1	@AndrewNCassidy Yep
1	@darth @mackenzievogt You can't even fav DMs which is just unfair
1	@jen_gupta It's definitely hot chocolate then! (Your secret is safe with me!)
1	@jen_gupta 🐶🍫☕️ (added tea just in case)
1	@GerardoBarbosa @planet4589 @PeterDEdmonds Twitter is a strange place!
1	@planet4589 @PeterDEdmonds @NASA Oh you guys 😳
1	@PeterDEdmonds @NASA @TrueSciPhi 😳
1	@emoontx I do this ALL the time. Or mute for same reason
1	@Real_Johannes_P You sound like you need the sleep  good night
-1	@Real_Johannes_P Hate to break it to you dude but it's nighttime.
1	@franco_vazza @PeterDEdmonds https://t.co/Kdlil6B9Zm
1	@darth I'm saying maybe we don't wanna open the box to find out darth
-1	@darth In some cases a wave can act as a particle  maybe the apparent marbles were just an interference effect
-1	@darth Are you assuming prior hingedness and marble-having because this may be the problem
1	@mcnees That article doesn't even get the difference between dark matter and dark energy
1	@HilaryKHarper @CassiniSaturn @kevinmgill I will be happy to be proved wrong!
1	@PeterDEdmonds For one  yeah
-1	@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 OK here's a short (but technical) post on what's wrong with the analysis: https://t.co/Kdlil6B9Zm
1	@IreneElisabethH @CosmosMagazine Thank you! :)
1	@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 It still finds strong evidence for acceleration. Just not as strong as some others who use different assumptions.
1	@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 I'm not expert enough on supernova systematics to say what's up w new analysis  but it doesn't change anything
-1	@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 Sorry for the brief responses -- I've been out and unable to answer in detail. Basically  tons of evidence for DE
1	@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 It's really not
1	@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 No
1	@GlobalEcoGuy @seeoh2 Depends what you mean by "indirect." Lots of evidence for acceleration and/or for an extra component of universe
1	@selennata @starstryder I'm really not sure what you're referring to here
1	@alienghic Well I have definitely received quite a few "good job well done"s in response here
1	@NforNihilism I don't know!
-1	@jpdowling @ScienceAlert Sure  testing/verifying results is. Headlines that make it sound settled  not so much. :/
-1	@jpdowling @ScienceAlert Also this write-up misrepresents claim (weak evidence for acceleration  not evidence against) &amp; confuses DM &amp; DE…
1	@jpdowling @ScienceAlert *say one group of authors  using a new technique  whereas other techniques &amp; data sets strongly say opposite
-1	@MisfitDeveloper No one is saying hard work is a bad thing
-1	@mcnees Yep. I had to block hundreds of accounts after their brute squad put out a tweet about me to their disciples.
1	@mcnees I mean they're just explicitly parroting Trump campaign talking points now
1	@mikamckinnon @dragonarchitect Aww 💔
1	@noah_anyname https://t.co/ZMeVE2OdCr 😕
-1	@DarryWillis I hate them too but I haven't seen it reported elsewhere
1	@darth 4) Blame Michelle Obama
1	@physicsjackson @jr_pritchard Yep! :)
1	@elSpike @corbett @tweetsoutloud 😀
1	@bencubby Never pass up a chance for a cheap wormhole joke
1	@CaliaDomenico What link? It's important to give credit when sharing creations like this.
1	@niais @merrdiff @johannateske @chgreer @jegpeek Yeah the full thing was long but if you skip based on hearing titles it was like 20 min.
1	@kejames @rocketman528 @CaliaDomenico Graphic is by NASA  apparently. See credit here: https://t.co/GCZ4Evc5zO
1	@hanipersian Thanks!
1	@CaliaDomenico Did you make this graphic?
1	@RobertGaristo @PhysRevLett Maybe you can convince airline security to relax liquid restrictions for BYO radiation shielding
1	@upulie @KetanJ0 It was v good movie despite misleading title
1	@upulie @KetanJ0 @guardian https://t.co/pmOyghGCzG ?
1	@tweetsoutloud @JamesSACorey @AquaBirdie OK yes I will do this
1	Which is all to say: would've been great if @ESA_EDM had worked perfectly but there's still TONS of AMAZING #ExoMars science coming at you.
1	@ionn @BreakfastNews I'm not sure  but if I get a recording of it I'll tweet the link!
1	@murielsoz Thank you!
-1	Here's a brief clip from my appearance on @BreakfastNews today  talking about #ExoMars and why Mars is so difficult: https://t.co/JPwhqNlby4
1	@itsa_talia As much fun as it always is to get yelled at by Trump supporters for days  I might sit this one out
1	@PeterBell7 @anusha_srini @BreakfastNews Is there a Vine recording somewhere?
1	@DaveCurran99 I'm not sure how Musk plans to deal with it. I'd expect he'll use some kind of heat shield -&gt; parachute -&gt; rocket combo.
-1	@lorengrush @alexwitze @mirikramer @RachelFeltman It's deeply unfair that the debates fall right in the middle of my workday
1	@lorengrush @alexwitze @mirikramer @RachelFeltman 😖
1	@algi80 It's less comfortable  feels weird.
1	@ZULU401 @BreakfastNews All the scientists are on Earth  getting paid to create new innovative technologies that improve Earth
1	@remybergsma NO SLEEP MARS WILL EAT ME
1	24-hour 🚀 recap: * 2 people ➡️ Tiangong 2 space station 🤗 * 3 in Soyuz 🔜 @Space_Station  * @ESA_TGO 😎 * @ESA_EDM 😊🤔😧 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ * @NASAJuno 😴
1	@SciGuySpace ☹️
1	@SciGuySpace JUNO IS GONNA BE OK
1	I'll be on @BreakfastNews at half past to talk about #ExoMars!
1	Update on #ExoMars: all looks good for orbiting @ESA_TGO; status of @ESA_EDM lander still unclear: https://t.co/JMzmTyIkHx
1	@darth THE POTATOES NEED OUR HELP DARTH
1	@mcnees Apocaless?
1	@mcnees But  hey  June was revised down  so  uh  that's… less apocalyptic?
1	@itsa_talia Oh so that's what happens when the eggs hatch
1	@Pillownaut It's incredible
1	@DeschampsPat @jonrosenberg You're welcome! Check this one out: https://t.co/NGv3No2SAK
1	@ycopfiles You should do this for everyone whose words you copy  to give attribution  because that's how most ppl read tweets. All the best.
1	@ycopfiles Retweet is perfectly adequate. Format you used is used for tweeting to a person. Quotes around my words would've been clearer
1	@ycopfiles You could just retweet. Or quote tweet.
1	@ycopfiles Putting my name at the end isn't giving me credit  that's not how it works
-1	@ycopfiles Why are you copy-pasting my tweet back to me in this bizarre way?
1	@DeschampsPat @jonrosenberg There are several dark matter detectors! They work differently from SuperK but are underground.
1	@tcortellesi I'll be very happy! And scared.
1	@sgtMIKE2 ORLY?
-1	@MisfitDeveloper Applied twice! Didn't quite get to interview stage  alas
1	@DrMRFrancis @AmeliaHammy I can definitely deliver on the promise
1	@DrMRFrancis @AmeliaHammy Mine is "😕"
-1	@jarrodthekiwi Some are from shared block lists (so  probably  to others)  some were abusive to me  some I just didn't want to deal with
-1	@cdodrun "Block and move on" is easy to say when you only have a few followers! I blocked at least 50 accounts yesterday.
1	@patronaut0709 Yeah but she doesn't seem to use it
1	@itsa_talia Someday.....
1	@itsa_talia Erm...
1	@upulie I always thought being a sock puppet would pay better and involve less astrophysics research
1	@IbnulHussaini Size of observable universe same  total mass same. But distribution of matter different than previously observed.
1	@atAjithJ @ska_papers Depending on which data sets &amp; analyses you believe  it's been ruled out for many years.
1	@SlowWaterMvmnt You can untag me from this discussion
1	@MisfitDeveloper @astroduff No
1	@aliceinthewater I don't think so
-1	@AndrewNCassidy Oh it's way worse. Dark energy is ~70% of universe. Matter only ~30%  of which most dark.
1	@JeremyCaron Hm I'll tweet a bit about it hold on
1	@RyanWVoll You could still read my tweets if I muted you (but don't worry I don't plan to!)
1	@Mr_5h33pD06 OK thanks.
-1	@AndrewNCassidy :(
1	@chiIIinois Have a wonderful day
1	@chiIIinois All the best to you
1	@chiIIinois I have no idea why it was bombed. I'm a pacifist.
1	@rdrimmel Sure.
1	@FernRoyal https://t.co/F1ZetzG9so
1	@FernRoyal No  it's just a different understanding of how it's all distributed.
-1	@REasther @kevinschawinski @tpoi @Medium A lot of job/fellowship applications forbid listing papers that aren't published in journals.
1	@mcnees 😦
1	@physicsjackson @gfbertone In what context?
1	@mattmfm @darth I can't even fix this with only a single alternate reality guys
1	@xeni @BoingBoing 🤔
1	@lyndalovon @CosmosMagazine Not yet
1	@Mk2Salamnder @BeCurieus @Antiproton_com @realscientists Sure  I'd be up for it
-1	@DrRubidium I mean seriously half the stuff he's denying is literally on tape what is he even bothering with this for
1	@DrRubidium 🎶 "She even caught me on camera!" 🎶
1	@JoshuaGuess Totally agree!
1	@GerardoBarbosa @LaskyPaul @novapbs I don't think that will take long!
1	@kevinmgill Is this a visualization or a composite from real images?
1	@mikeynerd 😇
1	@MJIBrown So  outdated already
1	@eqe @micahflee Yeah I discussed this a bit with another person. https://t.co/MrbXZB1rmn
1	@TheTXFlash All the best to you
-1	@MBBrownSF Hm maybe I should correct though I don't think most people would know distinction so probably not particularly misleading really
-1	@MBBrownSF Distinction is sued for vs charged with?
1	@poloniumman That's one of the things we're trying to find out!
1	@astrodave2 See my feed!
1	@mcnees STAR EATER SQUIRREL!
1	@nillie_kj https://t.co/XMxivETESc
1	@EzoszResyek All the best to you and goodbye.
1	@AstroPJJ That's what I mean by "something we can see" here: https://t.co/Td7ZEd8FSG Could be quarks  leptons  bosons...
1	@TheN5OfOntario Same kind of thing. But a dark matter particle might be its own antiparticle 😳
1	@thefooleryoftom Check the link -- that's 8 hours
1	@jarrodthekiwi @RogerLickers @jonrosenberg *bracing for inevitable burrito joke  because someone ALWAYS makes it*
1	.@jarrodthekiwi @RogerLickers @jonrosenberg So much stuff is going through you. #DarkMatter  neutrinos  cosmic rays  gravitational waves…
1	@jpdowling @jonrosenberg …but that doesn’t work if no non-gravitational interactions.
-1	@jpdowling @jonrosenberg Usual assumption is #DarkMatter came out of primordial soup (end of cosmic inflation) along wit everything else.
1	.@jpdowling @jonrosenberg If #DarkMatter ONLY interacts gravitationally  we have a bigger mystery: how it got here in the first place!
1	@IanPAMacDonald @jonrosenberg All of the above  in different ways!
1	@voidshaper Ha  probably not  actually. They’re a cool idea though!
1	.@cwmagee There are limits on dark matter particle mass. (Given some assumptions.) Usual assumed range: between ~0.1 &amp; 10 000 x proton mass
1	@MultipleNights @jonrosenberg That’s true — within our Solar System  way more regular matter than dark — DM is more evenly distributed here
1	@algi80 Pretty much! Done it once as actual research. Mostly just like to see stuff.
-1	.@MisfitDeveloper Surprisingly difficult to make #DarkMatter go into a #BlackHole! Doesn’t lose energy via collisions  just orbits forever
1	@LarryWest42 @jamie_hall Sterile neutrinos aren’t in the Standard Model. (Technically  no massive neutrinos are!)
1	@tinapanossian Nah  because as Universe expands it gets less dense  so dark matter particles will meet each other less often.
1	@AJPearson23 @elakdawalla She is following me! :)
1	@Pharaoness Aw thank you Sophia! &lt;3
1	@ChefSJ Awesome! :)
-1	@GerryGonzalo @tanyaofmars @duffy_ma Um  probably  but specific point here is that GRE is a bad criterion that exacerbates inequality
1	@itsa_talia It's pretty darn good sometimes
1	@noah_anyname Ah  this is a good point
1	@Lavochka_Poseyd You can remove me from this discussion if you want to continue it
1	@Roy_Astro @tweedishgirl @CassiniSaturn Yep  that's Prometheus. See info in link I tweeted.
1	@GerryGonzalo @tanyaofmars @duffy_ma More white male correlates with higher GRE score  but higher GRE score doesn't correlate with success
1	@darth @kmattio @ericgeller Is it marzipan because marzipan is very nice
-1	@haywal83 :(
1	@altvarg That's her podium  not his.
-1	@Paleophile I watched the last one and pulse went through the roof  hands shook. Don't really want to go through that again.
1	@physicsmatt OK sounds good. You're the one with the LHC connection but lemme know if I can tweak any numbers for you
1	@stoutde Yes I have already decided to vote against the Nazi.
1	@_TheGeoff Apologies for what?
1	@BadPhysics @hataroni (Also: I sometimes check Tweetbot or Tweetdeck for quote-tweets)
-1	@BadPhysics @hataroni (delete one of the "I don't know" things in there  my brain is destroyed from packing)
1	@BadPhysics @hataroni Which  I don't know  maybe is true  I dunno.
-1	@BadPhysics @hataroni Yeah  at the moment mostly people saying a theoretical candidate horrible to women of color only would be electable.
1	@rolfje No  no notifications  just the notifications timeline tab
1	@hataroni Yes  the patented @BadPhysics Method!
1	@BadPhysics Your hybrid quote-tweets are the best.
1	@nika82016 I'm bisexual and proud to be in the LGBT community. All the best to you.
1	@uniquename439 None. I have to give them all back to the box company.
1	@pjf "it is our destiny to explore the far frontiers of space" &lt;- yes v good
1	@pjf This is very good and helpful thank you
1	@pjf Thanks! Checking it out.
-1	@EzoszResyek All the reports I've seen say about 1 in 4 for assault. For rape  numbers vary quite a lot -- seen anything from 1/4 to 1/7.
1	@BadPhysics No  it's a very local move
1	@President_Bunny Nah  nothing like that. My landlord sold my apartment out from under me.
1	@MisfitDeveloper Books don't make anywhere near that kind of money. (And I don't have that kind of time right now!)
1	@upulie @mpesce Yes v close
1	@upulie @mpesce New one will have sunset  which is OK I guess
1	@upulie @mpesce New apartment has other views  not as nice. Is bigger so will need to have company more often I guess.
1	@upulie @mpesce It was the best apartment  with the best views.
-1	@upulie @mpesce I am really sad to lose it. 😥
1	@aussiastronomer @jason__rhodes Pls take me with you next time
1	@SlotmachinQueen Bill Clinton isn't running for president. All the best to you.

-1	@Leaving_Orbit :(
1	@itsa_talia Not to be confused with RuPaul
1	@itsa_talia There are too many Pauls and Ryans and Rands and Ayns
-1	@itsa_talia I am worried that when Florida destruction hits TV everyone will forget Haiti
1	@part_ickle See few tweets following up; am discussing with people
1	@jarrodthekiwi Not stuff like this. Cosmic rays might affect cloud cover at a very small level. (See e.g. https://t.co/vJyaI77obi)
1	@mikeynerd And the Meteors!
1	@MisfitDeveloper Oh well! Thank you for checking. :)
1	@DrMRFrancis Yeah I usually tweet on my phone so I'm just in the habit now of doing it there.
1	@MisfitDeveloper @tauriqmoosa Thanks  I'll try that! (Do you know if they can be seen on the mobile app?)
1	@itsmeaghanns Early universe stuff... cosmic strings  primordial black holes  axions. All theoretical things!
1	@kevinschawinski Are you going to share with the class?
1	@rolfje It doesn't match field demographics in physics. Pretty sure not in other areas either.
-1	@itsa_talia @kahoakes Tiniest robot war!
1	@travelanita Oh I guess having some merit is a thing only men do.
1	@BoingBoing OMG I love this
1	@kejames Oh wow
1	@jegpeek Hm maybe yeah
1	@michelle_lmc At what point are the women below the measurement noise? &lt;1% now.
1	@michelle_lmc Word
1	@michelle_lmc Male Nobel Laureate tally now at 201!
1	@upulie @gbricketts Cosmology is a sub-field of astrophysics it's all good
1	@apdmassey Physics is the worst  statistically  of the original prizes
1	@aliceinthewater 😒
1	@pauldcox @vohbo Pulsars got a prize  but Bell-Burnell wasn't one of the recipients.
1	@vohbo You're correct  but neither has received the prize for these discoveries. (Both still alive: J Bell-Burnell and V Rubin.)
1	@natmcmolecule @joabbess OK thanks for letting me know
1	@mikeynerd Thank you! :)
1	@DrMRFrancis Wise man.
1	@PenguinGalaxy But what about DARK CHOCOLATE  Alice? NOT ALL CHOCOLATE
1	@natmcmolecule @joabbess @n1vux It's a picture that hasn't changed in decades. Also no one requires equal numbers in high school.
1	@natmcmolecule @joabbess https://t.co/xhoQcFcqtz
-1	@BespokeCheese @DrMRFrancis @REasther Omg dude if you unironically use SJW as an insult you are following the wrong astrophysicist
1	Check out these pieces by @DrMRFrancis https://t.co/bn7qCLB5ul &amp; @REasther https://t.co/epaSxi0mCF on culture of physics vs the Nobel Prize
1	@DrMRFrancis In case you haven't seen it yet  @REasther covers a related set of issues with the prize here: https://t.co/epaSxi0mCF
1	@upulie Just the usual  "why are people talking about [celebrity] instead of Nobel Prize?"
1	@JohnRSports @upulie Tweeting about what?
-1	@RyanWVoll Well that dude doesn't know anything about my job but I am on a fixed-term contract at the moment. Academia's a tough gig.
-1	@itsa_talia Surely the fact that he said over and over again that he would (eventually) release his taxes himself also has some bearing
-1	@homeruntrots @darth I think a poodle mix? Not sure. He is not my dog  alas
1	@darth He is leaning sleepily I think he might be nodding off but when he really sleeps his tongue comes out a bit https://t.co/KNxcBBjFvk
1	@darth it was so good darth he is a very good dog
1	@darth did you see this
1	@himanisharma Yep! She doesn't use it a lot though
1	@DaveCurran99 Nope
1	@R_Trotta @gravitate_to_me The majority of people who have power to actually do something don't seem to care  or want to make changes.
1	@GeoSciTweeps Is he? That's really cool!
-1	@R_Trotta Unfortunately I haven't seen anything like a culture change happening. :/
1	@GeoSciTweeps Oh I think maybe I was at that one! Well  I was at a dinner at Lloyd House he attended.
1	@MarvinDMartian2 @marsroverdriver @tootallrutt Planned impact speed was about 0.9m/s but I don't know if they got measurements
-1	@lukedones @michael_w_busch Oh I know. It’s just frustrating when it’s not possible to say EVERYTHING  you know?
1	@lukedones @michael_w_busch In full interview I might have said something like “we think asteroids or comets” but can’t recall exactly.
1	@lukedones @michael_w_busch The quote in the image doesn’t make a claim  for instance — just says we’re learning. Can’t remember exact words
-1	@lukedones @michael_w_busch Whenever I talk about it online or in the media I try to be equivocal since it’s not settled. I was last night.
1	@lukedones @michael_w_busch Yeah a lot of that stuff is interesting. There’s tons of evidence in several directions; still unclear what’s up
1	@Kupeplex @thefooleryoftom :D I love @planetforgium
1	@FlyingFiretruck @ABCNews24 @bevvo14 Dude I don't think you want to go down this road
1	@kejames I'm imagining tapping it with a spoon like a soft-boiled egg
1	@thefooleryoftom Ah  ESA sent it to me after an outreach event. No idea where to get one otherwise though I think 3D print info is out there
1	@Space_Mog @NLchemist Rosetta has already been with the comet for perihelion once: https://t.co/W4zNqEzenn
1	@gargpit Around 6 years
-1	@EricFielding @GeoSciTweeps @Philae2014 Do you know of any estimates about how long the orbit will remain stable?
1	@SFriedScientist @RachelFeltman It'd be interesting to see cash breakdown -- raw value of hardware (space) vs jobs (here) in mission budget
1	@elakdawalla @_elbertina At 51m?
1	@elakdawalla @_elbertina Also if it's a wide angle camera it seems like a field of view of 2.4m more plausible from 5m up than 51
1	@elakdawalla @_elbertina Ah  thanks! Let us know if you find out?
1	@_elbertina Perhaps @elakdawalla could clear it up?
1	@_elbertina Could they have misspoken on the stream?
1	@_elbertina Official Twitter feed also saying 51 meters though
-1	@_elbertina Hm I dunno. Maybe image caption is wrong?
1	@tinapanossian Thank you! (If we get more on this planet does that mean I'm free to go to space?)
1	@robcarrphoto Final velocity probably around 1 m/s. Unlikely to make a crater  probably largely intact
1	@mattkronner Nah  amino acids are "pre-biotic" -- they are ingredients of life  but not byproducts of it or evidence it's there
1	@aliceinthewater Well  bounce/walk maybe. Moon is 1/6 gravity of Earth; Mars is about 1/3.
1	@aliceinthewater Sure
1	@Qldaah @mareetimms @ABCNews24 It means I work with theories  not observations. I use computers &amp; math instead of telescopes!
1	@mareetimms @ABCNews24 Aw thank you! :)
1	@RachelFeltman @esaoperations @Philae2014 It's not right
-1	@bevvo14 @ABCNews24 I hope you have a box of tissues over there  it's gonna be a sad one
1	@upulie @DustinWelbourne 😟
1	@DustinWelbourne @upulie Did something happen on the live stream?
1	I’ll be going on @ABCNews24 in about an hour to talk about what @ESA_Rosetta taught us. #CometLanding… https://t.co/DCnTyer5Bm
1	@JPMajor :’(
1	“It’s about human beings. It’s about our birthplace in the Solar System” - @markmccaughrean explains significance of Rosetta. #CometLanding
1	@thePancakeBot It’s pretty black! https://t.co/loDe974yal
1	“Rosetta has made us have to change our ideas of what comets are” - @mggtTaylor on @ESA_Rosetta livestream. #CometLanding #GoodbyeRosetta
-1	@DrMRFrancis I WON’T CRY I’M NOT GOING TO CRY
1	@upulie @ESA_Rosetta 67P isn’t a sun-grazer  though  so hopefully will be OK for a while!
1	@upulie @ESA_Rosetta They will travel together on their little home until the end of the Solar System
1	@DattaguruP -&gt; https://t.co/wnxsBUn4wp
1	@DattaguruP It’s sort of at the right edge of the “head” part of the comet in that picture. See here for exact spot: https://t.co/trWA2PUNQ8
1	Some good accounts to follow for the #GoodbyeRosetta #CometLanding: @ESA_Rosetta  @elakdawalla  @mggtTaylor  @markmccaughrean  @MonicaGrady
1	@NforNihilism Well it might land in a deep pit so sorta
1	@markmccaughrean I will treasure it always!
1	@markmccaughrean I'm taking my mini-comet with me on the show  by the way!
1	@markmccaughrean I'm going on TV about an hour after the landing; I'm not entirely sure I'll hold it together and I'm not even involved!
1	@markmccaughrean @bbc5live @ESA_Rosetta Nice interview!
1	@cirquelar @astroengine @elakdawalla Is it cryobraking?
1	@jarrodthekiwi @Ksnickers @JPMajor @ESA_Rosetta This little comet model is roughly true color: https://t.co/zt7Qul1fZq
1	@itsa_talia @JPMajor @ESA_Rosetta How much speed  yeah. For Earth  it's about 11 km/s. For Comet 67P  something like 1 m/s -- walking speed!
1	@MisfitDeveloper I actually didn't realize she did! She's super cool!
1	@gayathrikamath Aw thank you :)
1	@AstroPJJ ☺️
-1	@Tweitzel @ESA_Rosetta Nah  everything will be shut down before impact and then it'll physically break. :/
1	@PeterDEdmonds Someone give me millions of dollars
1	@ProfMike_M Thank you! I heard it a few times in a meeting where I was one of only two women &amp; I knew other didn't care. No one corrected.
1	@lachlanmartin @ProfMike_M Person hours. Staff hours. Work units  if defined.
1	@stoutde Also that the big things &amp; little things are completely unrelated
1	@Lydeey  -&gt; https://t.co/Qt2HxWGVGC
-1	@Lydeey @astrolisa Why is realistic skepticism automatically negative?
1	@thefooleryoftom You are the 7th person to suggest that  a thing that is in the article I tweeted. 😐
1	@tobadzistsini Godwin's Law doesn't apply when the comparison is apt &amp; crucial to the discussion. Look it up if you need to!
-1	@uniquename439 A common  tragic situation
1	@jonrosenberg @CNN I think he is being given a lot of extra points for resisting making reference to his penis
1	@CNN @jonrosenberg I don't understand how 38% of people could see that debate and think "Trump did well!"
-1	@dd9000 @FakeUnicode @Dictionarycom Darn lexicographical clickbait
1	@astrokatey @davecl42 Think of your friends everywhere!
1	@ScienceNelson She has had a LOT of practice
1	@kevinschawinski I mean to me it looked like a train wreck for Trump but I don’t know how his voters feel.
1	@esargent184 @Paleophile Word.
1	@kejames @SpaceAssocOz I can't believe it either
1	@planet4589 @DownHereOnEarth "habitability of icy worlds" sounds promising!
1	@concernecus Ha I was teasing! I don't know where the astrophysicists near you are but you should find them  they're probably cool
-1	@concernecus Why do you hate astrophysicists Brendan
1	@PatrickRuffini @JayAlver @RawStory No  Elon's climate response is electric cars &amp; batteries for renewable energy. Space stuff is separate.
1	@mcnees Let's give him more credit — totally possible he did both.
1	@dd9000 I find the visual stuff helpful  but in the end it has to work with the math too
1	@kevinschawinski Hm good point  but there's also the Heat Death  the Big Rip  and vacuum decay to consider. I say we split it.
1	@DattaguruP Is that some kind of a joke?
-1	@ChrisDudley85 I really have no idea why you're trying to argue with me on this  but it's incredibly tedious. Bye! 👋🏼
1	@ChrisDudley85 Cute but no you don't get to tell me what to say about the subjects of my professional work.
1	@ChrisDudley85 @KittyCaffeinato @DrFunkySpoon Glad to hear you enjoyed your class. All the best &amp; goodbye.
1	@ChrisDudley85 @DrFunkySpoon Dude are you trying to explain astrophysics to me? 'Cause I don't think you should.
1	@HiRISE What is this?
1	@ChrisDudley85 @DrFunkySpoon I can say a lot of words! Language is wonderful that way.
1	@upulie Yeah pretty sure not
1	@RiAus I'd take one-way!
1	@medicmsh3141 Totally! My peak wavelength is around 10 microns  in the infrared
1	#Mars is just ridiculously beautiful and fascinating https://t.co/7JhtIiNI2w (image by @HiRISE  blog/info by… https://t.co/iGvGsjTCsZ
1	@fladdle It's more Earth-like  so that's a big part of it. And there are indications it used to have liquid water  so maybe life(?)
1	@TakeThatHistory @OnieXOX Uh hi I'm not an astronaut I'm an astrophysicist but I don't see why both KK &amp; I can't be role models in diff ways
1	@Widainmor Bye.
-1	@icarusfactor You may have misunderstood concept of "vacation"
1	@kevinschawinski https://t.co/FXVcZrjHxA
1	@kevinschawinski Hello! (I'm in Queensland at the moment)
-1	@EastBayBruce Didn't see any but wore stinger suit anyway
-1	@EastBayBruce No  alas
1	@DaveCurran99 Not sure but my understanding is that the damage is driven by climate &amp; things like development  not tourism.
1	@seakaterun @sandentotten 😃😳
1	@NoyzeSmythe Feel free to continue your discussion with that person without me
1	@AndrewJYoungs My activism includes actually doing everything possible to make world better  not turning my nose up bc I don't like system
1	@AndrewJYoungs Gonna be a HECK of a lot harder to make progress on anything if Trump wins.
1	@coreyspowell @Helen_E_MC Oh no
1	@CameronAuclair4 @cpwernham No clue what you're trying to say now  but all the best.
1	@CameronAuclair4 @cpwernham Maybe he is happily sleeping around. Again  I honestly do not care  as he is not running for president.
-1	@AndrewJYoungs I think it's weird to see voting as endorsement of anything. I see it as choosing which future will make my activism easier
1	@AndrewJYoungs Voting isn't about endorsement  it's just choosing which future to help bring forward. There are two futures. Choose or not.
-1	@jtotheizzoe @SciDebate She knows this is going out to a science-concerned audience  but it matters what she says to general public too.
1	@jtotheizzoe @SciDebate Sounds about right  though I'd probably deduct a bit for Stein's previous statements  since these are so different.
-1	@lshapiro30 No  it's the same issue. Stealing content  pretending it's your own
1	@PedroPeros Well the announcement was more recent
1	@markmccaughrean Dude you're doing the wink thing again
1	@_Insomnious_ Gahhhhh
1	@DaveCurran99 Find a hobby that isn't hostile to others
1	@DenzildeanNY All the best to you
1	@mikeynerd :) I'm from LA  it's a thing. I also say "awesome" way too much
1	@stoutde No worries  it happens
-1	@DenzildeanNY I don't blame anyone for blocking anyone else. Always a free &amp; reasonable choice.
1	@hankgreen @jtotheizzoe @smartereveryday Ugh wait hold on didn't even mention awesomely fascinating AI subplot
1	@jtotheizzoe @smartereveryday It's so good!
1	@DuttonChemistry @NthChapter Yeah I have it pretty good here. I guess I meant it's hard to imagine that being the case generally
1	@WallaceMarkS *faves while walking*
1	@NthChapter I can't even *imagine* a future in which postdocs are compensated in accordance with their contributions
1	@stoutde @neimhaille Hi would you mind continuing this discussion without me from here?
1	@AusAndgie7 @hitinman 😨
1	@misterdevans In this case  layering thought to be sand deposited by wind  not water
1	At the AstroLight Festival @astrofestVIC at @scienceworks_mv tonight! Big crowds  lots of science! #astrolight16
1	@mcnees I. What?
1	@PlanetDr @alexwitze Entirely possible!
1	@JohnRSports @PlanetDr @upulie IKR?
1	@alexwitze By my definition of substantial  a handful of grains doesn't count
1	@alexwitze Depends how you define substantial....
1	The @OSIRISREx mission will be the first to return a substantial amount of material from another world since Apollo. #OSIRISREx
1	Just over half an hour till @OSIRISREx launches! https://t.co/H47JW4EBB7
1	In less than 9 hours  @OSIRISREx blasts off on its mission to asteroid #Bennu! https://t.co/HAD3q3GTRA Unfortunately no passengers allowed
1	@UnoTejano Lots of things! Is there a specific thing you're curious about?
1	@UnoTejano What question?
1	#Melbourne tweeps! Come to @scienceworks_mv Saturday night for @astrofestVIC &amp; hear me talk #DarkMatter! https://t.co/UmB1c7ymzV
1	@mcnees Bob many people are saying
-1	@agtmadcat Oh  hm. I'm not sure where to find that exactly. I'd probably just have to search around  I'm afraid...
1	@agtmadcat Maps of our galaxy or other galaxies?
1	@mistersaxon @OSIRISREx No  it'll be a really tiny sample. Asteroid is about 500m across.
-1	The asteroid @OSIRISREx will sample  Bennu  has a v small chance of hitting Earth in late 2100s.  Just like humans to throw the first punch.
-1	Tomorrow this rocket will take @OSIRISREx into space to chase down an asteroid &amp; steal a bit of it. (launch~7pm EDT) https://t.co/agIsTunTk0
-1	@DrRubidium @GertyZ I refuse to believe the entire existence of the article isn't satire
1	@kevinschawinski @ProfBrianCox @EricIdle @onitek @neiltyson @heathercampbell I'd be happy with a few rows back on that one actually
1	@Tweitzel Thank you!
1	Hey look it's video of me on @BreakfastNews talking about rocket explosions and missions to space rocks https://t.co/ONoyEwxo5r
1	@physicsmatt I've been doing a bit of that this year
1	@Tweitzel It's on the right hand side of the page
1	@MisfitDeveloper Hm good question. I'd say yes but for this question I'm more interested in specific crowd-funding campaigns
1	@starstryder @DrMRFrancis My biggest google conflicts are a singer-songwriter  a cricketer  &amp; an…online performer…who goes by AstroKatie
1	@verbiscer IT'S SO FRICKIN' EXCITING!
1	@mhultstrom I hear that is what they look for! :)
1	@verbiscer *waves hello*
1	@mhultstrom Someone's gotta hire me into a tenure-track job first!
1	@mhultstrom Oh
1	@mhultstrom Also I don't have a tenure board; I'm a postdoc
1	@mhultstrom I didn't say that. I was just commenting that I wish I could do everything
-1	@mhultstrom What negativity?
1	@mggtTaylor Just don't accidentally get them confused and resurrect aliens on the comet because that could make things messy
1	@mggtTaylor @Philae2014 @ESA_Rosetta @TheRealGZA @Rosetta_OSIRIS OMG
1	@kejames I dunno. I don't think there's more they can do than image Philae though. @mggtTaylor might be able to say more...
1	@d612539 @CosmicRami @astroduff @BreakfastNews I like it!
1	@DRG_physics @ebpetroff Well there are degrees of mysteriousness
1	@PooleAvery @BreakfastNews @uommedia @unimelb Thanks so much!
1	@MisfitDeveloper Awesome thank you! :)
1	Was a pleasure filling in for @astroduff on @BreakfastNews today! Talked rockets &amp; space rocks. Thx @d612539 for pic https://t.co/eMyTHWteuF

1	@grb090423 That's the south pole
1	@SanMedra Totally
1	@mggtTaylor @ESA_Rosetta 😥
1	@Mark_HFX Yeah  it rotates about every 12 hours
1	@Mad_Science_Guy Yeah definitely
1	@ProfMike_M See next tweet! :)
1	@markmccaughrean @Rosetta_OSIRIS @ESA_Rosetta 😍
1	@JPMajor "Someone made this video..." 😐
1	@markmccaughrean @Rosetta_OSIRIS @ESA_Rosetta Gah I can't handle how awesome this is
1	@MisfitDeveloper Yeah
1	@DrMRFrancis These are the best
1	@AndrewJYoungs I’d love to do it but I don’t know if I can take on any new projects of that magnitude right at the moment!
1	@RiAus @theotherdrsmith Everybody likes cosmic disaster shows  right?
1	@voidshaper It wouldn’t look like anything because the bubble of true vacuum would expand at the speed of light. But way more destructive
1	@tauriqmoosa @DrMRFrancis Tauriq how long have you known us
1	@theotherdrsmith Do you mean @RiAus or @ScienceChannel? Do you think it would need a content advisory?
1	@voidshaper Vacuum decay has a special place in my heart
-1	@poloniumman @EngineeringCHS I heard about the student experiments. So sad. :(
1	@AscendingNode Yikes! Lucky escape!
1	@AusAndgie7 I've been there!
-1	@Summer_Ash @kejames If I'm not in bed when America gets up  I know I've done something wrong
1	@kejames @Summer_Ash Something similar happened to me except I over-stayed-awake and also rocket
1	@Space_Station @mikamckinnon @Astro_Kate7 @NASA_Astronauts Is there a particular reason for using hashtag instead of handle?
-1	@CNN You can call him a rapist  CNN. His extracurriculars aren't really the important thing here.
1	@FakeDanTosello @TrueSciPhi Ha awesome :)
1	@FakeDanTosello @TrueSciPhi Wait really?
1	@LeeBillings @lorengrush @mirikramer I just got excited at idea origin had been nailed down. Because mystery! Even if definitely not aliens.
1	@LeeBillings @mirikramer @lorengrush Ain't that always the way
1	@LeeBillings @lorengrush @mirikramer Yesterday's statement to me read as "we think likely terrestrial but don't know for sure"
1	@LeeBillings @lorengrush @mirikramer I guess I'll have to wait till on computer to know what that site says. Prev statement was inconclusive
1	@LeeBillings @lorengrush @mirikramer Page won't load for me 😬
1	@LeeBillings @mirikramer I mean I haven't seen confirmation of the signal's origin -- do those docs have it?
1	@LeeBillings @mirikramer I haven't seen this -- is it posted somewhere?
1	@TrueSciPhi August  hey.
1	@GregoryWeinkauf PLEASE SHIP ASAP
1	@AtyHans Yes! Slide rules and room-sized computers and unaided human brilliance got us as far as we've ever been. Really awesome stuff.
1	@AtyHans It's so much fun to read about how they did stuff like this. The whole Moon program was seat-of-the-pants stuff  but it worked
1	@Fliipp_ @AtyHans https://t.co/BBqyBYZXsD &lt;- Google is an amazing thing
-1	@emoontx That's just a trick of light on a crater
-1	@Paladin1969 Thanks man. It's not so bad really. Been a while since horrible people came after me en masse!
1	@tabinfl Yeah we're trained to look for the least interesting explanations first
1	@mcnees Really? Which one?
1	@mcnees I wonder how they choose
-1	@LoriKFenton Hm I haven't read the paper and unclear from the summary; maybe @martinselvis2 could answer?
1	@mirikramer It *could* be something interesting! Like...microlensing! Or aliens I guess maybe
-1	@mirikramer Aw :(
1	@mcnees Wow  yeah
1	@michelle_lmc :( I'm glad you got away OK
-1	@michelle_lmc Ugh that's awful
1	@nadiamdrake @suthers @SETIEric Thing I'm advocating: observational follow-up  sensible reporting that makes VERY CLEAR it prob isn't aliens
1	@nadiamdrake @suthers @SETIEric Definitely good to go look at it  more data certainly needed. Not sure massive media storm helpful though.
1	@suthers @SETIEric Yeah I see why the media is covering it I guess but it's still odd that such an unlikely-to-be-real thing got singled out
1	@nadiamdrake @arielwaldman Yeah stuff I read says people are actively searching now  just hasn't been fully examined yet
1	@hugorealtor It's just a matter of getting the training really
1	@dbastian2 @b0yle If you look at the astronomers  we're all pointing in the direction of "don't call it aliens"
1	@jlacroix93 @mcnees Oh don't worry we will tweet about it when it's done  you can be sure of that!
1	I'm working on a little calculation with @mcnees and it's so much fun and it's going to be amazing  just FYI. #TwitterScience
1	@mcnees Maybe the coffee will finally do it
1	@mcnees But we figured it out decades ago  just didn't figure out how to get people to care 😞
-1	@upulie @SwiftOnSecurity OMG everything on the internet is lies
1	"Habitable" &amp; "terrestrial" already ambiguous; we should save "Earth-like" for when we really know https://t.co/akfxFexoir by @mirikramer
-1	@dog_rates @darth OK I give tentative approval to this plan  pls let me do the petting I mean judging  PS yes they are indeed mighty nerds
1	@dog_rates @darth What if they are all good dogs tho
1	@dog_rates @darth I have seen the dog award shows they are very body shaming and I do not approve
1	@twiddlekins @upulie @AdamRutherford How did it get in my hair?
-1	@upulie @BespokeCheese I use a block bot it makes Twitter possible
1	@upulie omg
1	@upulie 😍
1	@upulie I think they have set
1	Spent the day sciencing with @upulie &amp; we were very productive &amp; definitely didn't spend our time tweeting at each other across the table
1	@FlyOpineMonkey @upulie There is no basking only science also Upulie knows me too well and is kind enough to tolerate anyway
1	@FiveFrogsBlog @upulie Already posted one!
1	@upulie To be fair the pie was really quite nice.
1	@upulie It would be the best life

1	@algi80 The latter. Traversable.
1	@physicsjackson I'll be careful! Congrats on new job by the way!
1	@CorvusTheYoung @EverFlores07 @mcnees Fortunately this is already a thing I actively avoid! All the best to you &amp; good luck in your studies.
1	@CorvusTheYoung @EverFlores07 @mcnees There are so many sentences! First sentence of page 91 also v good
1	@SteveShawCA We don't have access to it and also it might not exist
-1	@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride See whereas I don't like idea of policing thought crime. Bc we can't know thoughts/beliefs. Only impact.
1	@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride I.e.  by your argument  a joke can only be bad if the person believes it. Otherwise all good.
-1	@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride Ohhhh you're only concerned about thought crime. OK. Makes sense now.
-1	@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride I no longer have any idea what argument you're making  if any  so I'll leave you to it! All the best
1	@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride @jinxeptor Dude context is what we're talking about. The context of the society &amp; the joke's impact on it
-1	@EverFlores07 @docfreeride @jinxeptor @mcnees Honestly I don't care at all whether or not you're sexist. It has nothing to do with the issue
1	@EverFlores07 @docfreeride @jinxeptor This is an excellent illustration of the concepts described in the expert thread @mcnees shared!
1	@EverFlores07 @mcnees @docfreeride Why not?
1	@EverFlores07 @docfreeride @mcnees @jinxeptor Depends on joke  but essentially  yeah
1	@EverFlores07 @docfreeride @mcnees @jinxeptor Doesn't matter whose opinion it is. What matters is impact. Stuff like this says sexism OK.
1	@OldLadyCart Moon is always rotating!
-1	@EverFlores07 @mcnees Which is to say  jokes are not some kind of magic get-out-of-harm-free card. They can themselves do harm.
1	@EverFlores07 @mcnees "dispar- agement humor communicates message of tacit approval or tolerance of discrimination" https://t.co/MMEzsrvyez

1	@mblackmn Are you familiar with @the_ephemerides ? You might enjoy that one too!
-1	@mcnees Maybe data needed something else to be the plural of since no one ever seems to use datum anymore :(
1	@markmccaughrean @MerrickPhillip Oh gosh  I was hoping I was exaggerating a bit more than that!
1	@AstroPJJ I haven't figured this part out yet

1	You can watch Deep Space Network signals come in on your Twitter feed too if you like: @dsn_status (HT @voidshaper @elakdawalla)
1	@DarryWillis It is!
1	@voidshaper Oh gosh that's a high-volume feed. Super cool though!
1	@mggtTaylor Dude STEREO-B hasn't been using the DSN for almost 2 years; it can have a turn! :P
1	@JeremyCaron Oh absolutely. But a lot of time on Twitter does have real value
1	@cirriculumvitae It's a theorem that's been around a while. Basically BHs are pure spacetime objects  no real substance to them.
1	@EdDarrell Dude when I say "all the best to you" that's a sign-off  not a "please keep me in this conversation" cue
1	@OuttasightPV Doesn't require any atoms of anything in vicinity
-1	@OuttasightPV They radiate a spectrum. But it doesn't really happen through the particle/antiparticle thing. More complicated.
-1	@OuttasightPV @thisoldgov @sandarcon Scenario like that doesn't work. Would increase mass of BH  not decrease it.
-1	@voidshaper Technically even the big ones can make Hawking radiation  it's just super dim &amp; likely lost in glow from stuff falling in
1	@voidshaper Basically. And we don't know if they exist. Could potentially make little ones with high-energy particle collisions too.
1	@OuttasightPV @thisoldgov @sandarcon You're thinking of a popular explanation  involving virtual particles  but it's bit more subtle really
1	@voidshaper Not that I know of
1	@mcnees No that's the star; the world is in the other direction
1	@mcnees Oh dear god what have you done
1	@dcastelvecchi @physicsmatt So it turns out @minutephysics did this in detail  got different answer https://t.co/eQDThzTZmQ
1	@haywal83 Not a chance
1	@GeorgeTakei Thanks for the FB shout-out :)
1	@asymbina @GlennF @doctorow All right  have purchased. (Yay for immediate electronic access to books!)
1	@FernRoyal I saw the FB post! Whole thing is unreal
1	@pestanabjj Supermassive black hole pulling in gas/dust at center of a galaxy  resulting in glowing hot disk of material falling in.
1	@BeckePhysics @StartsWithABang As far as we can tell  expansion totally same in all directions. Different in time of course.
1	@BeckePhysics It's not a privileged/"absolute" reference frame but it's a frame we can define. See last bit of this https://t.co/ruJuJCfM7l
1	@TrueSciPhi Oh that's lovely
1	@Astrophiz Dunno  send me an e-mail with more info?
1	@mggtTaylor OK I guess that’s also a good cause. :)
1	@mggtTaylor You should totally apply anyway  since you’ll have all that free time after Rosetta’s… um… event.
1	@mggtTaylor Nah dude  YOU rock. In a cometary ice &amp; rubble kind of way. (Thank you!)
1	@mikeynerd It is a drawing of me! https://t.co/5NGSDf64gU
1	@CyborgN8VMari Thanks!
-1	@CitizenFour5 I'm not really into having hate-followers. All the best to you.
1	@darth 😃🐶❤️
1	@cirriculumvitae See this for context: https://t.co/NqXd2Z1fhX
1	@PrinceDignity I'm a research fellow in theoretical cosmology
1	@TeamGleason it was an honor. I'm very inspired by your strength  courage  positive attitude and family. Thank you!
1	@vr_doug A thousand thanks to the VR Lab. Without people like you  human space flight would be a much riskier business.
-1	@spacechelle same as Julie's. drop me a note
1	@spacechelle Same. Hope we meet up!
1	@TaraKaliszewski @Astro_Clay it worked for me...but with the reintroduction to gravity I can relate!
1	@sharonbrunton @julieann_rn - good point!
1	@spacechelle thx Chelle  almost there!
1	@irishspaceblog can't wait to look down and see Ireland! Beautiful in person so I'm sure it will be beautiful from space
1	@selyb still hard to believe but getting closer every day
1	@NASAJSCStudents @Illinois_Alma @NASA_Johnson I like this pic as well of Illini at Johnson Spaceflight Center http://t.co/oYsOLLZFcK
1	@ChezWu some of my favorite food was oatmeal with raisins  sausage pattie beef stew cashew chicken curry candied yams and lemon gelato!
1	@jayjum yes- harder than I thought
1	@MyTXGC not that I know of- but could be!
1	@slbscifi @drmlb Stacey- that is way cool!! Congrats!
1	@AstroWendyL @drmlb @slbscifi Congrats to my friend Stacey on her first SciFi book " Dissention" (on Amazon).  Years of hard work! Awesome!

1	@drmlb not enough! :)
1	@marcozambi hey Marco! Thanks and say hello to everyone in Lecco for me. Had a great time when I was there.
1	@dittmarml is that great or what! (going to miss it....)
1	@dittmarml yep! Although the cameras can never do the view justice - but this is pretty cool stuff.
1	@dittmarml view looks like that from the ET camera but moving a lot slower! Not for long..
1	@schierholz yes I was able to watch. I hope to catch both games tomorrow too. We are up at 5:30am as part of our sleep shift.
1	@NEVIE_JOHN Multi-purpose Logistics Module. It is the cargo carrier we are taking with us in the payload bay.
1	@Astro_Nicole yep. Nicole I had  ducks and a turtle crossing the road event on my way home last night. The wilds of Houston..
1	@NEVIE_JOHN just for the contingency for rescue. One person returns every 3 months so for 4 it takes a year.

1	@cleytonkaio :) well then... a HAPPY early birthday to you!  I hope that this year treats you wonderfully and more safely than ever!
1	@thenasaman Took about 2 days for muscle memory 2 restore. Balance was pretty good by 3-4 days  catching balls was about 5 days.
-1	@thenasaman Shuttle has a defined stay time  so they cram in LOTS!  & after they leave  we have SO MUCH to put away  & organize.
1	@johnnie50 Nice pic
1	@mars_stu Not much astro observations on this mission. Most of our visual external observation is on the Earth and atmosphere this time.
1	@DrSamStrauss Thanks BUNCHES  Sam! Made me smile!
1	@ageekmom :) & thk u for holding your breath for so long!  Now  BREATHE again... :)
1	@Darwin1800 We have many cameras onboard. During our day  you can see us on the NASA channel  & VERY soon on the web (early Feb??).
1	@ageekmom Thx bunches again.  Shall I/Should I RT your tweet ??
1	@ageekmom Thx for sharing that link.  Nice collection of pics of our crew & activities!
1	@thenasaman :) thx for the encouraging words.  Will endeavor to keep tweeting.  HOPING to post some pix here soon of the past few days...
1	@ageekmom Thx 4 the well-wishes.  I do so hope and plan to ENJOY! :)
1	@ageekmom For a while we have been discussing e-book readers.  There are PDAs onboard that can act like that  but not one of the tailormades
-1	@thenasaman Not yet in space  so can't answer yet that part.  But have not been out at night because it's COLD. Plus have had clouds.
1	@ageekmom Paper books are an upload mass/volume issue.
1	@ageekmom Tried to tweet-in to the tweetup.
1	@spasmunkey Great! Can't wait to see pix from the tweetup.
1	@ageekmom Is true: Oleg had family but both Soichi's & mine are still in the US  due to academic finals/school rqmnts.They will arrive Tues.
1	@ageekmom Both family will be there  and my best friend(s) will be at launch. Thk u for asking.
1	@ageekmom VERY good fit check - good to see just how tight it really is.  All systems look good. Thx for asking!
1	Thanks to @ageekmom  and  @lucied_inthesky for those 2 URLs.
1	@ageekmom Thank you for the FB link. I KNEW of this  just hadn't been there yet.  Will RT it shortly. Thk u!
1	@ageekmom Glad you like; and glad you are following!  thk u for sharing with me the adventure  excitement  & focus.
1	@bethbeck :) Making history with a snowball.... not sure that's a good thing though :)
1	@thenasaman If know far enough in adv  we can change our orbital altitude; if not  then sheltering in OUR Soyuz.
1	@ageekmom "Last time b4 launch..." -- a little bit of that  da. Not sadly so  but "different".
-1	@ageekmom Egak!I missed the 'boarding' question.Let me delay answering til we do our fit-chks early on in Baikonur. I can describe btr then.
1	@ageekmom Thk u.  Is going fine... having to focus a bit more to get "chores" done.
1	@bethbeck Snowball -- now wouldn't THAT be a surprise to see coming at the on-board crew as the hatch opened??? :)
-1	@bethbeck The occasion was the traditional trip in to Red Square to lay flowers at the grave of Yuri Gagarin.
1	@spasmunkey Final reviews for some systems and for "rescue" equipment; also final fitchecks in Sokols in the Soyuz.
1	@spasmunkey Thank you bunches!  And  me too!  Looking fwd to HRF!
1	@thenasaman It is my HOPE  & my PLAN to answer Twitter questions from orbit; THAT live-time technology should be in place w/in days.
-1	@ageekmom on Earth  the carbonation knows which way is up (burping); in orbit  not. And bubbles "hurt".
1	@ageekmom I KNOW I will miss "bubbly water" -- I like sparkling water a lot!  That  and breezes... pretty sure.
1	@thenasaman RE: interest in space program: the Russians don't differ much frm US interest. There's national pride  & wonderful engineers  2!
1	@bethbeck Thanks much! Keep your fingers crossed!
1	@thenasaman :) You are interested!  Why wouldn't I?
1	@bethbeck THANK YOU very much!  Glad u enjoyed!
1	@thenasaman GLAD that I can!  Thx for following!
1	@ageekmom thx!
1	@ageekmom uh oh... is that good? :)  btw  WHICH tweet????
1	@ageekmom Da  will be tweeting all along  even from Station  & upon return too.
1	@ageekmom :) thx.  I'm at 830 now.... let's see what happens. :)
1	@ageekmom ginger bone structure;  darting back and forth is likely to be an issue with joints  ankles. Will see what bonemass is when rtn.
1	@ageekmom I probably won't be able to play competative tennis again for ~6months or more. But I'll get there!
1	@ageekmom duration of rehab varies in stages -- but full rehab is about a 1:1 month ratio of being in orbit.Can drive in a week or so.
1	@ageekmom GOOD idea on the tweetup.   We'll see how things are proceeding post rehab  and where the opportunities are best.
1	@ageekmom Been in Russia since 7 Nov  for the duration. Going to Baikonur on 8 Dec.
1	@ageekmom :) :)  made me smile!  Will see if we can't make a tweetup happen once back  AFTER re-hab!  Thx for suggesting.
1	@ageekmom Awwww.... THANK YOU for sharing that with me! &lt;&lt;HUGE SMILE&gt;&gt;
1	@ageekmom Thx.  You too.  Rest well.
1	@ageekmom Made me smile HUGELY!  Is my honor -- thx for following.  I hope to share & entertain... let me know how I do  ask questions too.
1	@ageekmom BTW  you are correct.  Am a FE for E22/23  and I did indeed train with E21 folks a bit.
1	@UniphiSpaceAge Thank you for remembering.

1	@Louiestowell @NASAWatch I obviously agree. :-)  What's important now (IMHO) is to keep building and growing from this.
1	@spacechelle @SNCspacesystems @astrosociety I'll second that thought!
1	@spacechelle @Astro_Clay @Astro_Pam @DARPA That would b great  but would love my daughter to do that! #STEM #girlsinSTEM
1	@chitownchica Spoke to tie in from scouting days to working as an astronaut. Also spoke of importance of #ISS research. Then Q&amp;A. Was fun!

1	@BrynLaidlaw True!
1	@joannekarma Sure can. Slept through the night during half the decompression.  Good way to pass the time. Would rather dive outside though.
1	@joannekarma True  but one constant I believe... no matter where we explore  Space or elsewhere  there will be something that amazes.
1	@CommandrNickel Flooding and Fire are the real killers for us down here.

1	@Rainmaker1973 @_KristinaluvsU Commonly used on Spacecraft. Reflects sunlight  reduces heat. E.g. Apollo lunar lander http://t.co/b2KakDsgqh
1	@philiplyth @astromicerule It requires  lots of careful planning and some #ISS propellant so we only do it for spacecraft carrying crew.
1	@philiplyth @astromicerule Timing: before Soyuz launch  ISS is pre-positioned in the right spot on its orbit so it's quicker to reach!

1	@DSpector1966 Nah--it's a multi-purpose design that can be an airlock  flying spaceship  rover  and more--it's a way cool concept.
1	@SSquire That sounds Awesome!!!
1	@Carbon_Flight Thanks Ed - it was pretty cool - they have done a great job on it so far.
1	@EricMolloy Cool picture Eric  and sweet model!
1	@helenpforrest @astronautabby Wow Helen - that's quite an undertaking - good luck!
1	@helenpforrest @astronautabby Just followed her - looks like a wonderful recruit - go get 'em Abby!
1	@omaflinger absolutely did.  You have to take every available opportunity with teenagers 😊
1	@spasmunkey Thanks Liz!
1	@sharonbrunton I'm pretty sure Bandit is a fitting name when it comes to mischief...:)
1	@Ed @usairforce Freedom is paid for by sacrifices of our military men &amp; women...AND their families. Happy 31st to Mac's dad--well done 302nd
1	@jnmatthew @carbon_flight aw shucks Josh - thanks- you're the man!
1	@sharonbrunton Just a little guy - 12 weeks old.  We are getting him Friday  so I'll post a picture.
1	@sharonbrunton might be a typo  but you said the payback was "Hugh"-just adopted a beagle named Hugh-renaming Bandit-but that's really cool!
1	@sharonbrunton Beagles are great.  They take a lot of work at first  but they're worth every bit of effort &amp; payback with years of love.
1	@GabriellaRitaT @usairforce Gotta love Chuck!
1	@Carbon_Flight There was a ton left - you should be good to go!
1	@normbnyc Now that would be cool!
1	@EricMolloy Thanks Eric!
1	@PC0101 Deal- I'll attach the 250mi ones as soon as they let me take some 😉
1	@normbnyc absolutely!
1	@Carbon_Flight your wife is better looking than me  best to have her next to you...
1	@spasmunkey might have to wait a while  but maybe someday...
-1	@Carbon_Flight That's bad board etiquette - oops...
1	@DavidOverSkies @Carbon_Flight @NASA David  there is a ton of aerospace in FL from the panhandle near Eglin AFB to Cape Canaveral--anywhere
1	@mwilkinson3 @astron8 @chrisastro nope- @Carbon_Flight was running the show - I'm just the guy talking to the crew.
1	@DavidOverSkies @markjonesjr Thanks David  I can only hope to someday to even come close to measuring up to such a legend-He will be missed.
-1	@DavidOverSkies @ahpilot @MarkJonesJr very sad - he was a great explorer.
1	@DavidOverSkies @markjonesjr David  I'm a Lt. Colonel  going up for my Colonel's board early next year.
1	@markjonesjr Don't know about that - you get about 2lbs of extra personal stuff  so not much room.  I'll definitely take a TPS patch though!
1	@DavidOverSkies @markjonesjr David  looks like Mark has you covered with his blog posts - FTEs are awesome.
1	Had a sim today w/@Carbon_Flight &amp; @bearcat_stress to get ready to support the ISS crew on an EVA 30 AUG-can't wait to do this for real! 😜
1	@markjonesjr I'll check it out  thanks
1	@RosUNwell It's the real deal Tab - check out @AstroRobonaut &amp; http://t.co/04qyJA2L
1	@juniperala @astro2fish @astro_clay Nowhere near as cool as your profile picture!
1	@torrencesalces Not sure Sally - but I'm really glad it was a success.  Next step is to put some seats in there!
1	@IBhappyhopi @Astro_Clay Absolutely agree - he's a great teacher and a great guy.
1	@therealdjflux @MCapp22 Very cool!
1	@GabriellaRitaT @spasmunkey told me about @ISS_ScienceOps where they tweet about science real time--check it out!
1	@torrencesalces Night launches are always beautiful &amp; Don is always full of fun comments!
-1	@torrencesalces Sally  sorry for the delay and thanks for the tip - I'll check it out.
1	@torrencesalces Cool Tip Sally - I'll give it a try!
1	@torrencesalces Thanks for the tip Sally - I will!
1	@spasmunkey I'm restoring my old vette right now-don't think anyone would pay $250K for it though :(  Thanks for the interesting article!
1	@bubbaradio Thanks Bubba - you da man!
1	@amikokauderer Amiko  Tim Peake just got an account-can you hook him up with a shout out from the NASA-Astro account?  @astro_timpeake
1	@Astro_Clay @chucktheoneduck @Astro_Nicole Amen to that! Our questing spirit has yet to be quenched-there is so much yet to "discover"...
1	@bubbaradio Absolutely!  Can I be your first guest?
1	@bubbaradio Thanks again for the mention Bubba - you guys rock!
1	@therealdjflux Alrighty - I'm sure he'll tweet on Tuesday for the Discovery departure from KSC.  He's a great guy
1	@amikokauderer Amiko  how do you get the blue seal certification that some astros have on their account?  2🐠
1	@Ed @schierholz @usairforce Amen to that-the Raptor is an absolute dream to fly-God bless the brave/talented men&women who fly&maintain it!
1	@ShuttleAlmanac Awesome picture!
1	@jane_macarthur Awesome Jane- have a great trip!
1	@therealdjflux Me too!  What a cool place - can you imagine how cool that looked when it hit? (until you were vaporized…)
-1	@H_P_R_U @psyclechick @Astro_Clay That's just not nice :(
1	@psyclechick @H_P_R_U @Astro_Clay No there's an idea!
1	@H_P_R_U @astro_clay @psyclechick Nope  not yet.  I'm a big fan of Clay  he's been a great instructor for me since I've been at NASA.
1	@Astro_Clay @astrodrayer Well duh- gotta build up some brownie points that I can spend in the pool :)  Looking forward to it sir!
1	@astrodrayer @Astro_Clay Dex and Clay are awesome people too - you know how to pick them!
-1	@SpaceCampUSA She's a grad right?  I'm jealous - and yep - she's a cool lady!
1	@amikokauderer Thanks - and nice profile picture :)  I'm open to any suggestions you have to do this better.
1	@schierholz I'll sure try - thanks for following!
1	@SpaceCampUSA Deal!
1	@PC0101 Thanks for the advice Peter - I'll take it to heart and do my best.
1	@SpaceCampUSA I wanted to go to Space Camp SOOOOO bad - but I always had to work the family construction biz :(  What a great pgm you run!
1	@psyclechick @mgrabois @Astro_Clay @H_P_R_U  Sounds like I have a lot to learn!
1	@Ed @Omid @AdamS @schierholz Thanks for the welcome Ed!
1	@Astro_Clay Alright sir  finally pulled the "twigger" - open to any advice you have for doing the twitterverse right.
1	@Luthien_I Thanks Luthien!

1	@AvpdIsapain I think it's more that he has allowed people that hold these beliefs to feel justified and enabled.
1	@hugorealtor agree.
-1	@hipquark @quadraticadder but I strongly think that if Clinton was a man  he'd be losing by twice as much
1	@quadraticadder but where is the evidence? This stuff hasn't sunk Trump. It should have

1	@Quixoticnance @mrkempnz very cool!

1	@ddfdba and underlying racism and bigotry plus the celebrity adoration in US.

1	@TheLeanMarie well yeah if we get a gravity assist  we're sitting pretty! Well...ish....still a looooong way...
-1	@CraftLass @headphonepete yeah that is tough when you have emotional ties. Such an awful thing to go through.
-1	@CraftLass I miss it too! Oh no - what's wrong?
1	@Andyg1110 @NASAWebb yes!
1	@CraftLass our minds are ridiculously in sync. It's all the music and space and enthusiasm pulsing in our brains &lt;3
-1	@CraftLass agree as long as we don't mess it up and fight. (Multinational telescope builders fight over ridiculous things)
1	@CraftLass I'm a Hillary voter - a pragmatist with dreams of space!
1	@CraftLass it actually does. I mean we can get carried away on grand possibilities but it always involves pragmatic decisions too.
1	@headphonepete @CraftLass I guess so. Would also give us a nice youthful glow to greet our alien overlords.
1	@Paladin1969 my consciousness would probably be better being sold at a Five and dime
1	@CraftLass I love how as human spaceflight geeks we have to face the battles in front of us first! #MarsOrBust

1	@Pillownaut @coachxcpayne @erikgregersen convinces me that the world sees all highly successful ambitious women as a little "evil"
-1	@Pillownaut @coachxcpayne @erikgregersen do people really believe anyone is capable of this much "rigging" or conspiracy?
1	@coachxcpayne @Pillownaut @erikgregersen ha! I need one
1	@coachxcpayne @Pillownaut @erikgregersen I'm only buoyed by the fact that the crowd sounded small?
1	@Pillownaut @erikgregersen just when I think he has outdone himself..nope.
1	@zeynepchnn @selennata aw Thankyou! &lt;3
1	@Pillownaut @erikgregersen did he just say he is great at writing and "loves reading his stuff?"
1	@Pillownaut @erikgregersen OMG I just saw it. And "unhinged Cheeto" is my new favorite Trump insult
1	@DrMRFrancis we need to ban all comets until we figure out what's going on.
1	@CosmicKayle but he models his skin color on Jupiter
1	@upulie eat toast.
1	@Mark_HFX congrats!
1	Commentator's Curse with the @OXY_Crimson. Interviewing @TheMoon112 and @n0ned   https://t.co/9ASadLZprA
-1	I will be streaming soon. @Wizzrobe will join at 6:10 pm pst and commentators curse at 730 with @TheMoon112 https://t.co/QsxQaTwegw
1	If you get @TheMoon112 in  I'm sure we can do a funny stick involving someone slapping me into him
1	@SSBM_Kira @_er0h I think he's referring to the Hitbox controller.  I have one if you want to check it out
1	@ChipotleTweets That's what my gf says! ;)
1	Just made it to HOT status for @ChipotleTweets https://t.co/DCAvTQEa0F
1	@ChipotleTweets thanks  you're the best
1	@makeishura caught a muk before
1	@_er0h click the bottom right button
1	@nottempts @CLG_PewPewU @ChipotleTweets @LiquidHbox That price makes no sense  considering 20 burritos is about $180
1	Gave you a shoutout in this video @TheMoon112   https://t.co/NpWVdrMUw4
-1	@TheMoon112 @Hypnotoad__ I think it would be depressing if no one leveled up in 7 months  don't you agree?
1	@_er0h spider rolls are yummy. Otherwise I prefer traditional nigiri
1	@_er0h do better and prove them wrong through consistent excellence
1	@MrWiz @TheMoon112 tafo
1	@_er0h No ads is probably unrealistic  given contracts with vendors and streamers.
1	.@progducto between this burrito bowl and the free food I'll be getting. It's no contest @ChipotleTweets https://t.co/D8GeOsQTHT
1	I'll blog about my experiences  trying to earn all of the @ChipotleTweets benefits here:  https://t.co/1xMAc1LXGZ
-1	@BullCraftMaxx @C9Mang0 predictable isoball killed them
1	Good starting points @ISS_Research @ISS_CASIS MT: “@GabrielleRab @RockefellerUniv. I would love to send an experiment into space!”
1	@spasmunkey all great art is ephemeral.  RIP Chumpkin 10/20-10/25/13.  The microbes win again...
1	Watch out  @Astro_Andreas  @Thom_astro has learned how to replicate himself.
1	The Chumpkin is sporting some hyphae. @spasmunkey I used to put AmphotericinB in my cell cultures. What does one put on a pumpkin?  Lamasil?
1	@spacechelle @msengupta @astro_reid Also  I'm pretty sure you and @Astro_Maker owe us one rendition of "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"
1	@Astro_Andreas @Thom_astro Just that I miss my two favorite interchangeable astronauts :) Hope you had fun at #SocialSpace
1	@Thom_astro @Astro_Andreas - Mogensquet?
1	@sharonbrunton Not yet.  I think it is just studying us.
1	@spacechelle @sdtingle You speak the truth.  There are only so many aileron rolls one can handle after lunch.
1	@psutympany we've been living underwater for 5 days so this helps the nitrogen come out of our blood slowly
1	@Astro_Clay @Astro_Soichi @AstroAcaba @Astro_Andreas but we all live in Bob the Barracuda's world down here http://t.co/uEIbTLIfpm
1	@Carbon_Flight @FCTMike @NicoleAtNASA I'm in. Age 12 I didn't make it onto the crew  I was science backroom. But I thought that was cooler.
1	@spasmunkey so you're saying we should try to be on good behavior now?
1	@JohnRSports that was a great NASA event  pretty cool to combine telescopes  @tweetsoutloud  and some really fun and interested kids!
1	@ageekmom of course I remember - couldn't forget fun times with #SpaceTweeps

-1	@spacechelle @astro_reid @Astro_Kate7 @astro_kjell @AstroSerena @Astro_Jeremy  I think Chumps 🐒will find this peacock behavior bizarre 😜
1	@AstronautAbby I ran 7 miles with my dog  Winnie.  I think Mars "pets" will be companion robots with AI.
1	@AstronautAbby @TheMarsGen Challenge accepted!  Let's all do something good for us!
1	@Astro_Clay @AstroRM @Astro_Naoko Happy Anniversary of launch day!  Sleep shifted  walk out  loaded  8.5 min accelerate ... Space! 🚀🌌

1	@UniphiSpaceAge @Astro_Clay @astro_oz @Astro_127 @SuperBowl @NFL #SuperBowl #Broncos
1	@azspacecampgirl @Astro_Clay Maybe-fruit needs to be able to survive ground handling  scrubs  &amp; launch jostling.  Plums may be most sturdy
1	@Astropular @Astro_Naoko @Space_Station I was glad to work with such talented and smart women!
1	@SJKincaidBooks @TheMarsGen I love it--inspiring the next generation through reading and imagination 🚀🎇

1	@MITEFnw Looking forward to hearing from @b0yle Roger Myers @interplanetary &amp; Kim Binsted
1	@tracy_karin @SkyscrapersInc Thanks so much--I believe we need to solve problems and dream and explore.
-1	@STEMJeff hang in there!  I'm trying not to think about food.  It would be easier if I could go jump in a rover and distract myself!
1	@dancingRNA @TheMarsGen Let's do it for scholarships  Trinna!
1	@Astro_Clay @Carbon_Flight @NASA Why thank you!  I ❤️ to represent the Evergreen state 🌲
1	@TheMarsGen @TEDxSIL @EverettCC @EdmondsCC I'm looking forward to sharing and connecting!

1	@Astro_Nicole @MAKERSwomen I've always loved the power I felt running; I'm so glad these young women are using it to bring about change!
1	@d_l_miller @Astro_Clay Did they involve patches  shots  food?
1	@d_l_miller have a great school year!  You are making an important difference
1	@d_l_miller No!  That's a very sweet space shirt!
-1	@Astro_Clay @azspacecampgirl Flattered but the math doesn't work out.
1	@d_l_miller @JohnRSports @SpaceCampUSA Especially the real rocks....ie geology 😜
1	@jaylupold My cousin got the microscope and I got the telescope--we spent many good days exploring!
1	@azspacecampgirl @Astro_Clay It is  and Dex was an amazing commander and a good friend.
1	@spacechelle @SpaceCampHOF @spasmunkey @tweetsoutloud @vincentvazzo @jbjim @Ekbierman Cool family photo!
1	@ESAstro_trainer @ReefBase @NASA_NEEMO wow  2  I have to admit I'm a bit jealous.
1	@jnmatthew @Astro_Clay 😜👍🏼
1	@ESAstro_trainer @ReefBase @NASA_NEEMO @astro_luca Tarpin!  Hope you get some night diving in  too!
1	@SpaceCampAlumni @SpaceCampUSA  I think so!  Beautiful night + catching up with friends + good music = FUN
1	@Astro_Clay @CamillaSpace Claytooooooooon!  We need you to come dance the funky chicken 😜
1	@AstronautAbby Space Camp!  😜
1	@NASA_Marshall @PercivalLowell Yes I visited in the summer of 2003 because of the history of the telescopes!
-1	@azspacecampgirl @Astro_Clay Some stories need to be spilled 😜.  He'll get me back.
1	@Astro_Jeremy @drcrater Sounds like the start of a new SciFi movie!
-1	@SpaceCampBoss @SpaceCampAlumni @SpaceCampKerby @SpaceCampUSA On my way from ATL to HSV I will time warp.  ✈️Takeoff: 1025 Landing:1023

1	@icarusfactor Yes!  Kids of all ages got excited; I love that energy.
1	@jaylupold Bummer  that's usually the weather here.
1	@jaylupold I'm glad that SEEC was great for another year; it was always great to play and dance with the teachers.
1	@nujoud I'm back to being a student and working on a MS in environmental geology at the UW.
1	@jaylupold Happy New Year!  Here's to new adventures and explorations in 2015!
1	@selyb I left NASA  so I'm not going to fly again.  However  many great folks are continuing the exploration dream!
1	@nujoud Yes  Steven's Pass!  It's a great skiing area for the family.
1	@SpaceCampAlumni @spacechelle everyone hanging out?  It would be fun to be there!
1	@SpaceKSCBlog Thanks for sharing this; it's interesting to see another pt-of-view.
1	@Space_Lectures HappyThanksgiving to you  too!  Much to reflect upon and give thanks for.
1	@jaylupold @Cmdr_Hadfield And we all had a blast!  Our mentors encouraged us  and we hope to do the same for others.
1	@Astro_Clay Hope your ears are burning because I'll be talking about my incredible friends and what a privilege it was to fly with them!
-1	@SallyRideSci in elementary school I dissected a cow's eye  heart  and lung.  I learned so much  and these parts would've just gone to waste
1	@ESAstro_trainer @NASA_NEEMO @Astro_Andreas @Astro_Jeremy Looks like a good crew!  Enjoy exploring and testing .
1	@SpaceCampUSA Work hard in school  pursue a degree in science  and aim for getting a job at NASA.  20 years after attending I flew in space
1	@jaylupold Have a wonderful year!  I wish your students the best  and thank you for your dedication and enthusiasm.
1	@Astro_Clay we're at the Woodland Park Zoo.  These made me think of you! http://t.co/HBlcXuWQdx
1	@DanSpace77 I won't be returning  but we can watch my friends as they continue the mission.
1	@jaylupold perfectly spoken  indeed!
1	@LynnSherr Thank you for researching and writing Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space.  It provides depth to an incredible woman.
1	@Cole_Anderson70 @Astro_Clay Go Cole!  Training is some of the hardest but most rewarding work!
1	@NASA_SLS very cool!  Thanks for the insight into a talented engineer!
1	@Aki_Hoshide @Astro_Jeanette @Astro_Sabot @Thom_astro @NASA_NEEMO Have a wonderful mission!  Looking forward to following you all.
1	@Thom_astro Have a great NEEMO 18 mission!
1	@Astro_Clay ;0) July 20th we can celebrate 45 years of knowing what it is really made of!
1	@ageekmom Geek moms gotta share their stories!
1	@DrSamStrauss that's exactly right!  Great to hear from you  Dr!
1	@libbydoodle @spacecampusa I dreamed BIG--20 years later my dreams became a reality.
1	@robcarrphoto I hadn't thought about using other technology.  I thought the "old fashioned way" with locating Polaris &amp; angle off horizon.
1	@jaylupold Very nicely put; exactly what I would expect from someone who bridges the arts and sciences with young students!
1	@Carbon_Flight @odyssey_flight It was an awesome day--always a pleasure to watch teamwork in action.  Now on to the Olympic Teams.
1	@NurcDiver @astro_nicole For real?!?  Well have a week to remember because  we won't forget you.  Please keep in touch.
1	@ESAstro_trainer Great article--I miss talking an texting with the team.  Hope all is well on the other side of the pond :0)
1	@thenasaman YES!  Thank you for informing and inspiring the next generation.
1	@mlazarusdean I cannot believe it has been a year; These men are all very talented and I miss working with them.
1	@sharonbrunton Fish are our friends (in the habitat)  but up here on land they are a part of my diet :)
1	@jaylupold Absolutely!  Wise words.
1	@rewir8rh83 Thank you for following; keep watching NASA as we explore!
1	@JohnRSports :0). I'm sure that is what my daughter imagines.
1	@therealdjflux We're glad you followed along!
1	@Astro_Clay Kathleen is amazing!  Great friend and mentor in college.  7billion people but still connected!
1	@Thedreadpirate @astro_nicole Today I used the same ride and a jet pack.
1	@Astro_Clay Wilco  Clay-tOn!
1	@SallyRideSci Including little girls like me!
1	@Astro_Nicole hope you get to visit; this is an amazing habitat and our research is compelling! http://t.co/ohDJSoP4
1	@mwilkinson3 @esastro_trainer @ustream I tend to forget unless I do something like spill my lunch all over and have to clean it up
1	@jaylupold That would be great.  My mom is: @JoyceMetcalf2
1	@ESAstro_trainer He outfitted us well!
1	@ESAstro_trainer @nasa_neemo Great seeing you guys in the water.  Such a gorgeous day!
1	@jaylupold N16 are not studying that  but when I spoke w/ NOAA it sounds like scientists are trying to understand through more research here
-1	@jaylupold @reefbase @nasa_neemo @astro_kimiya @astro_timpeake @neemo_steve The hard coral is dying  but the sponges and fish are thriving
1	@Stratocumulus Thanks for the shout out!  I agree  we are learning and doing amazing things down here!
1	@mrbdv @nasa_neemo @reefbase @spacecampusa Follow us at #NEEMO16 and our Science Under Pressure.
1	@d_l_miller April of 1990; what did Discovery take to space that same month and year?
1	@Carbon_Flight @spacecamphof @spacecampusa @spasmunkey Congratulations to all!
1	@amikokauderer HMmmm  it is not fair to talk about waffles or fish while we are in the Hab ;)
1	@spasmunkey @astroserena @astrosamantha @krubins Inspired in April of 1990  flew STS-131 April 2010
1	@AstroSamantha @spasmunkey @astroserena @krubins I agree  &amp; I thought about all of you today and what your accomplishments mean to daughter
1	@therealdjflux It's 100% humidity but the temp is delightful!
1	@Astro_Clay I knew there was a good reason to stay in Aquarius habitat!
1	@ESAstro_trainer Thanks for all your support and help today; it's great knowing you are on the team!
1	@jaylupold This provides air (through compressors)  power  and communication.  We call it the Life Support Buoy.
1	@therealdjflux No  this provides air (through compressors)  power  and communication.  We call it the Life Support Buoy.
1	@jayjum Cool factor; but actually they look like the real suits we use in space.
1	@d_l_miller @nasa_tv I feel the same--but celebrating that people are looking up!
1	@jayjum @neemo_steve No  but it made for exciting dinner.
1	@amikokauderer Should be an awesome adventure!
1	@Astro_Clay I voted  too  and I agree that we are blessed and should take every opportunity to vote.
1	@ESAstro_trainer @padi @astro_timpeake Always good to practice so that we are prepared for anything  but I don't want to be that diver.
1	@spasmunkey @saroy Looking forward to June 5th
1	@JohnRSports @astro_pettit You got it; looking forward to June 5th.
1	@Astro_yyz great thing about today's technology!
1	@HollandSpaceCen excellent!
1	@spasmunkey We will have some autonomy  but this is part of the experiment.  We'll see what happens and what crews might need in the future
1	@spasmunkey Yes--we are such multi-taskers (as a whole society).  Our mission will look at 50 sec one way.
-1	@jayjum I agree; we are not a very patient society.  During the mission we will have a 50sec one way delay
1	@Astro_Clay oops--I didn't guess anything;)
1	@Astro_Clay I'm going to guess that it is a volcano erupting in the Mediterranean?!?
1	@spasmunkey Yes!  EVH.   Nice job Spasmunkey!   Won't be exact  but will post when complete :-)
1	@Astro_Mike @IntrepidMuseum Fly Navy!   :-)
1	@Carbon_Flight @AstroAcaba              Fun!
1	@Carbon_Flight @foreman_mike I like it!
1	@spasmunkey .....will do!
1	@AstroPeggy     Go Peggy!
1	@NASA_Astronauts @Astro_Wheels ........go Wheels!
1	@SpaceCampBoss @SpaceCampUSA @Check_Six        Meeeee tooooooo Mike!
1	@spacechelle Wish I could Chelle!   You and Hock have a great event coming up!   Love it!
1	@Astro_Clay You got it Clay!
-1	@spacechelle miss ya Chelle!
1	@Astro_Kate7 @spacechelle @msengupta @astro_reid    uh ohhhhh...I think she's lost that loving feeling Tonto...time to break out the whites!
1	@selyb thank you Selynn fir helping today!   It was great meeting you!
1	@selyb Thank you...its beautiful out here!
1	@AstronautAbby This was his first camp  Mach 1.  :-)
1	@jegpeek Blimey. Everyone’s getting into the suborbital space game these days.
1	@AstroKatie @JPMajor Yet somehow make your presence felt through gravity. That's the hard bit.
1	@aallan Except the number not on the latest system is growing rapidly
1	@alex_parker @nolatredd Also reduces the proportion of the Universe within 2016’s light-cone.
-1	@jen_gupta Which has cheaper car insurance?
1	@cosmos4u @PlanetAndrewC @Dr_Lucie @ESA_ExoMars @ESA_EDM Right  but the landing systems are very different.
1	@SHSKPhysics @robinince Of course but both are pretty stubbon! Dark matter much more sensible than dark energy which makes little sense
1	When spacecraft reach planets  astronomers look to @astronomyblog and his interplanetary lobbing scoreboard:  https://t.co/TJjv7sKOMM
1	@w4bily5iszvvzjq They’re a few hundred million euros short currently.
-1	@chrisuk27 @esa It was  yes. Though I think only after the point where problems occurred.
1	@msbentley @esa_edm Apart from  well  landing…
1	@mountainhippo @esa_edm No idea.
1	@azureblue23 @esa_edm I think they’re just being very careful  and to be fair were very clear before that @ESA_EDM was a test.
1	So that’s it: @ESA_EDM was an interesting engineering test  which will need analysis. Seems clear science package lost.
1	Something odd happens in the @ESA_EDM data when the parachute is released. ‘Lander did not behave as expected’ from this point.
1	Focus on @esa_edm must be driving @esa mad. The orbiter - @esa_tgo - was by far the most important so it’s great that that’s in right orbit.
1	Not clear to me at least what the status of @esa_edm is : they’re saying there’s data from the lander - but not necessarily on the ground.
1	The orbiter is the most valuable piece of the mission  so this is great. @esa_edm would be great icing on the cake https://t.co/GraihJn6QO
-1	@mggtTaylor @PlanetDr @elakdawalla @ESA_TGO Doing real work today sadly
1	@aallan Presumably also consistent with a landing that was very nearly successful…
1	@kiai_kas @esaoperations That doesn’t mean @esa_edm is ok. Just the start of transmission…
1	The @esa_edm team had expected to have to wait for relay from @esa_tgo in just under an hour…
1	@wilksjeremy @pbdes We need orbiters for communications.
1	@megschwamb Live tweeting very welcome.
1	@cosmos4u Don’t give us too much credit; there aren’t coordinates there…nor a band.
1	@aallan Right
1	Phew! @ESA_TGO now free to head for its science orbit  and @ESA_EDM for an inevitable encounter with Mars itself. https://t.co/vpkLuY6gBk
1	Next up  #proximab discoverer Guillem Anglada-Escudé - 'if Neptune's orbit is a pizza  Jupiter's orbit is a pepperoni slice' @RoyalAstroSoc
1	.@apontzen delivering his @royalastrosoc award lecture. Congrats on both that award and a choice of a very stylish… https://t.co/kZ5bGFHTaH
1	Today’s @RoyalAstroSoc ordinary meeting looks anything but: https://t.co/5nCQvaQv52
1	@astronomyblog just a large crowdfunding campaign and a plan short of Mars
1	@ngc3314 They’re just too rare to have a decent training set  I think.
1	@AndreaWiggins So do ours...
1	@allplanets @megschwamb I’m not a huge fan of the tech argument; it’s too easily used by politicians to target funding to ‘useful’ research.
1	@megschwamb @allplanets stories about the funding part. A slide at the end thanking funders isn’t good enough.
-1	@megschwamb @allplanets Yeah. I think that we (a) never say when good ideas are blocked by lack of funding. (b) never talk when telling…
1	@mrwobblelegs @esa_rosetta @bbcstargazing Thanks!
1	@penguingalaxy @oxfordsitp Actually  that’s just @vrooje. The rest of us are here: https://t.co/gMHOsh9T59
1	@PenguinGalaxy @oxfordsitp I can't believe you're speaking in Oxford while the entire team are abroad
-1	@Somena Right now I'm complaining about the tone. Whatever the politics talking about people this way is damaging and hurtful
-1	@daverothery If @hannahdev talked to the same people I did today  #BepiColombo was notably absent from their comments. Which was odd.
1	@AndreasSchepers Thanks
1	@AndreasSchepers Can I bug you for the high-resolution version of that? Lovely pic.
1	@AstroEmz nice work. Sorry we haven't run into you yet!
1	@ExplorerDale @BBCAmos @BBCStargazing @BBCFOUR @ESA_Rosetta No - that was a complete surprise. Made life a lot more interesting!
1	@GeertHub Most of that is data transfer.
1	@RobertGaristo @JPMajor Waves from mission control
-1	@mggtTaylor Coward
1	@mggtTaylor Any bands in particular we should play under that comment?
1	.@mggtTaylor  crashing @ESA_Rosetta makes sure it goes out at its best  unlike 'bands from the 60s who are still touring' #cometlanding
1	@ProfMike_M Can I suggest the Journal of Brief Ideas? https://t.co/YpdO9pzOSh. You get a DOI and everything
1	@mggtTaylor @Bobby_Seagull @elss_freeschool I did and agreed. They all sat up when I mentioned you...
-1	@Bobby_Seagull @elss_freeschool Sorry I had to dash! Will say hi to @mggtTaylor for you all.
1	@jen_gupta @downcastapp to hear @Radiolab @NightValeRadio @TheSporkful @story_collider @ThirdCoastFest @SongExploder and lots more.
1	@harcel @hannorein @demitrimuna Right  I’m imagining some selection based on track record of contributing to useful software.
-1	@hannorein @demitrimuna One of the UK research councils tried software fellowships and was buried under a stampede of applicants.
1	@hannorein @demitrimuna I suspect the solution is to fund good people (to write software) rather than funding good software.
1	@demitrimuna @sarahkendrew I meant that consolidated grants weren’t the right mechanism  not that it was impossible to fund software in UK
1	@sarahkendrew @brettmor @demitrimuna It's definitely allowed. Not sure that system would favour such an application.
1	@dalcashdvinsky @GeertHub yes  come to @OxfordPhysics and @the_zooniverse
1	@brettmor @demitrimuna The @arxiv model is interesting - pointing out to institutions that they host users.
1	@kennicosmith @SkelligSP @ROGAstronomers Lovely to see you again. Hope all continues well
1	@m_vandenbrouck @microsoft @marscuriosity @hololens It’s great  isn’t it?
1	@jr_pritchard How helpful. Because we’ve notoriously just not talked to anyone else all these years.
1	@biblioforgetful Hmm. Thanks for putting all the buttons in the right places - credit where credit's due!
1	@realscientists You're either taking too generally or you're out of date. Plenty of places explicitly include broader impact in hiring
1	@shenovafashion @karenlmasters @robertcnichol I would be so up for supporting that. Fingers crossed!
-1	@JLGalache Yes: but sadly less likely to make it happen
1	@stephencwll Proposal to @esascience led by @martinabarstow
1	@SciGuySpace I saw ‘on the pad’ in the @spacex statement which isn’t the same as ‘with the pad’. Or do you know more?
1	@aallan @astrobrigi That rules out most of their customer base  which doesn’t seem smart.
-1	@astrobrigi @aallan Crikey  you’re right. Recovery from last loss was fast  so prob. not problems with timing. Reliability worries  though
1	@nova_road Thanks. Very useful work today.
1	@Jane_MacArthur They have backup launch windows into October  so should be ok even if there’s substantial collatoral damage.
1	@astrobrigi @aallan I’m pretty sure none of the upcoming Astrophysics or Planetary missions are booked on Falcon 9.
-1	@astro_liz @summer_ash @planetdr Sorry  you’re quite right. Still trying to erase old habits.
1	@aallan Sure. And actually still ahead of Ariane V at similar stage. But still - wonder what tolerance customers have.
1	@Astro_Jonny Thanks
-1	@Astro_Jonny Do you have source for claim it was static fire? I mean  that makes sense but haven’t seen that reported yet.
1	@WellsiteGeo First use. Trial of reuse was planned for October.
1	Reports from reliable sources (via @nova_road and others) suggest that a @spacex Falcon 9 rocket just exploded on the launch pad. #spacex
1	@standupmaths What (book? video?) would you recommend for english lit scholar who wants to understand how mathematicians view infinity?
1	@StephenCWLL Yep  next month's program is all about this
1	@jonny_nichols That would be fab. Let us know what you find!
1	@PlanetDr @doug_ellison Absolutely. It'll be fun finding out which this is though
1	@drarnakarick @vacant3rdman Just to be provocative - I think we need fewer astronomers building UX and more UX experts...
1	@drarnakarick @orbitingfrog @mrniaboc I don’t think I got an acceptable answer.
1	@drarnakarick All of them. All of them published by those who submitted them
1	@reneehlozek Interesting title!
1	@npr247 @kevinschawinski IT’S FINE I WAS AMUSED
1	@DavidHartley62 Sure. Anything you tweet might be recorded and used for training and quality control purposes...
1	@doug_ellison @cwg_nsf @marscuriosity Thanks for the update.
1	@cosmos4u Is it clear whose models are reliable? I wrote this up as a chance to test all of these models.
1	Starting the @LSST data science school with @shaka_lulu reviewing the code of conduct: https://t.co/aB9UWfhjGl
1	@shaka_lulu Do we have a hashtag?
1	@hannorein @naturenews @alsassociation Exactly.
1	@standupmaths What sort of solid?
1	@michaelaye Agreed. But for me the line is in developing user experience - there is a wealth of experience there we just don't have
1	@joezuntz @reneehlozek Good to see you last night https://t.co/xWjQfCnE2c cc @mrniaboc @drphilmarshall
1	@robertcnichol Are you at the #LSSTgalaxies meeting?
1	@david_hurn You were here? You should have said hi
1	@jegpeek @StAldatesTavern @LSST have a beer and all will seem well.
1	@CaseyDreier @NASA @SciGuySpace He's not wrong  but @ESA_Rosetta counts as a mission beyond Mars.
1	@StephenCWLL @BBCStargazing Olympics
1	@tweetsoutloud @PlanetDr Any chance of a pointer to those papers?
-1	@hastroparr Yes. But something is wrong because it's not 50/50 and I don't believe brains are unevenly distributed.
1	@hastroparr I have many talented female colleagues. More would be better.
1	@hastroparr So why are there so few women in Astro?
1	@hastroparr @dephelis Problem is culture of such 'jokes' deters women entering our field. Good for you for not  but others are put off.
1	@Daz555 @PeoplesAstro I like jokes. A broadcaster sending a message that half of humanity aren't welcome in Astro isn't funny
1	@PeoplesAstro Good for you. In the meantime  we'll be over here trying to fix the under representation of women in physics.
1	@PeoplesAstro For fuck's sake.
1	@mattkenworthy @BenneHolwerda @davidwhogg is there a paper on that?

1	@kidderowski @bbcamos Yes! It’s going to be incredible. Anytime we go somewhere new…
1	@robertcnichol Quite an odd set of diffraction spikes too
1	@iainkun @AEWmac @BBCAmos @BBCStargazing Oops. I had no idea!
-1	@StephenCWLL Sadly otherwise engaged.
1	@carlyhowett @alex_parker @elakdawalla Tell me about it (currently heading JPLwards for Juno). At least July 4th isn’t a real holiday.
1	@carlyhowett Seriously  though - Jan 1st? Couldn’t you have made @alex_parker and friends find something more convenient? cc @elakdawalla
1	@forrestn290 @bowbrick @nasajuno Yes  Jupiter has surprisingly strong aurora. Juno - arriving Monday - will help us find out why

1	@mandypatrish @vrooje @galaxyzoo @NASA_Hubble Isn't it?
1	@drarnakarick @kellecruz @sarahkendrew Should have said - write questions so we know what to answer. #dotastro
1	@drarnakarick @kellecruz @sarahkendrew Someone start writing the FAQ. Completely sold on nomination. #dotastro
1	@eteq I agree with that. You can probably have an effective distributed conference but it’s completely different from an effective f2f one.

1	@eteq @geerthub We have a publishing for software session led by @astrofrog @augustmuench on Thu.
1	Since @NASAKepler data was opened up (K2 vs original mission) - more papers  &amp; more early career authors. #openscience works! #dotastro
1	@brunomerin @eteq Was wondering if you’re maintaining your own data store or pulling from what exists.
1	Excellent example of #openscience - raw data from @NASAKepler hits the archive a few hours after being taken  open to all #dotastro
1	@mattkenworthy @aagie @astrofrog Ooh. Can we visualise the Galaxy Zoo decision tree with the Hololens and sort galaxies by walking along it?
1	@eteq You’d hope https://t.co/Pu8ZQFOTPJ would read from MAST. @Brunomerin?

1	@drarnakarick Let’s talk at coffee
1	@astrofrog @aagie @dotastronomy @AstroBrigi @metoffice Was going to write a funny reply but 'yes'

1	@philipbull Yes.
-1	@cosmos4u @hugho2 Agreed. Don’t think the release reflects the paper at all  which is sad.
1	@cosmos4u @hugho2 Yep  paper was on astro-ph before acceptance  press release followed acceptance. Seems ok to me.
1	@cosmos4u To be fair  the original sin is in the press release https://t.co/JpVK24RZnL
1	@ngc3314 @galaxyzoo That sounds amazing.
1	@megschwamb Right  but if asteroids brought the water and are amino acid rich...
1	@Spaceboffins Not in a paper  though  I think?
1	@b0yle Thanks.
1	@b0yle Though it’s true we don’t need more classifications right now.
1	@b0yle Just seen your article on @planetaryrsrcs. Asteroid Zoo is more on hiatus than in ‘limbo’ - the team are working on the data…
1	@PenguinGalaxy @KmunityOfEquals @the_zooniverse delighted you're there though! Have fun
-1	@michaelaye Hell yes
-1	@KmunityOfEquals @PenguinGalaxy @the_zooniverse Our application for a talk was turned down  which is a shame
1	@arielwaldman The former - very much so  with the data looking good. The second is on hiatus.
1	@jen_gupta it's an amazing job that deserves someone great. Or everyone great...
1	@e_astronomer Spent ages working out all the bits. The best thing is that the Moon ball (sadly cut off that pic) shows the correct phase…

1	@megschwamb @markmccaughrean @kwwillett @weatheronmars To be fair  it was published in a peer-reviewed journal. Just not a highly ranked one
1	@markmccaughrean Aliens. Or Comets.
-1	@markmccaughrean @kwwillett @weatheronmars @megschwamb At least I have a new case study for my ‘why crowdfunding is bad’ talk.
1	@kwwillett @drstuclark Just noticed the amount of money they’re asking for is shifting too. Now $18000  presumably to attract further cash.
1	@kwwillett @weatheronmars @megschwamb Also odd is insistence measurements be taken with comets in particular part of the sky.

1	@shaka_lulu Thanks.
1	@shaka_lulu Interesting…which talk is this?
1	@DavidBflower @DawnSunrise1 @BBCStargazing @dallascampbell we last covered it 20 years ago!
1	@AdrianSpalinky it's quite hard to form a elliptical one  though it is possible for very grazing impacts
1	@telescoper @GeertHub @arfon  #carryonupthearXiv
1	@kevinschawinski Definitely.
1	@kevinschawinski Yep  we use it. Excellent  though as it's another communication channel also distracting.
1	@realscientists l didn't know that. Despite having John Gurdon as Master of @magdalenealumni while I was there
1	@jegpeek Planet Hunters is consistently our most popular project (~200 000 or so participants) and I guess 50% of people astro?
1	@jegpeek @mrniaboc is the keeper of the stats.
1	@some_landscapes So completely sold on this  but only if Richard Long is involved.
-1	@astronomolly @johndebes Expensive  though.
-1	@johndebes @astronomolly Trouble is arguing against exams means you end up in a more subjective system. And we know people are biased…
1	@richardws @philae_ptolemy In understanding how it switches on and off between active and inactive.
1	Interesting to hear how important @DiamondLightSou is to people studying cosmic dust at #rascosmic
1	@Astro_Jonny @robinince Yes! I spent half of this afternoon trying to work out who the Mail had nicked it from.
1	@NGC3314 @dalcantonJD @kwwillett @jegpeek @astronomyblog Only if he did so sorely
-1	@dalcantonJD @NGC3314 @kwwillett @jegpeek @astronomyblog Halley always sadly mispronounced  though sound an idiot saying it the right way
1	This is the book we were enjoying earlier - Kepler's description of a supernova  visible in the map cc @DavidGalvin9 https://t.co/0q7Kwnn1Nj
-1	@DavidGalvin9 Going in the wrong direction. Have a look at the serpent-bearer...
1	@DavidGalvin9 @RoyalAstroSoc close. But no cigar.
1	Filming at the @RoyalAstroSoc today for #skyatnight - anyone recognise this wonderful object? https://t.co/abrOgjsZB7
-1	@tychogirl @jacquelyngill Problem is the less-specific. Eg request received for 'details of all modern cosmology  suitable for 8 year olds'
1	@JacquelynGill @TychoGirl Already get lots of emails; short specific questions always welcome
1	@adamrutherford @robmliddell @mickylachmann @tracyjosseditor @mggttaylor It's a model of the space station on @toriweaver's home planet.
1	Here's the #skyatnight's award from @europaws - well done @robmliddell @toriweaver et al cc @BBCStargazing https://t.co/DvgRMPahnZ
1	@markmccaughrean @bbcskyatnight @ESA_Rosetta @EuroPaws Thanks! (V. Welcome) news to me cc @robliddle @toriweaver
1	@jegpeek @augustmuench Also: are we sure that people will use the information well? What if job cttes value 'had idea' over 'did work'
-1	@jegpeek @augustmuench @powersoffour I think it puts a huge pressure on submitting author to describe contributions. Not going to be easy
1	@helenarney @dalcantonjd @standupmaths Bet @ProfKateJones will have something for the evolution one.
1	@dalcantonjd Looks fun. I know @helenarney and @standupmaths who are hosting.
1	@hathorsdaughter Was on last night  so now on iPlayer…

-1	@ActiveAstro sorry  guys - I'm afraid I'm out today.. 
1	@Blackprojects Yes!
1	@daverothery How would we tell?
1	@jen_gupta We should get you to meet the Adler team cc @windycityastro
1	@megschwamb we've been there before
1	@BurtonHat @fugexlac @realmikeernst @businessinsider @ScienceAlert But could we afford them given the salary cap?
1	@todrobbins @vruba Kepler data is now available fast which is good - and this was a @planethunters discovery…
-1	@Peter_Grindrod @UCL_CPS @andrewcohenbbc @BBCStargazing Sorry I threw your stuff on the floor
-1	@astronomyblog I think not as low level but I am wondering. Literature rather sparse...
1	@penguingalaxy I wish this was easy. But yes  agreed.
1	@penguingalaxy ALL OF THEM
1	@reneehlozek Why are you getting emails from squirrels?
1	@kevinschawinski you can't serve more than one branch of the government at once  I think.
1	@cosmos4u Yes. But still impressive!
1	@SabotagedFool A huge amount of work goes into calibration
1	@jradavenport @GeertHub @davidwhogg @jonathansick @adrianprw @exoplaneteer @jegpeek almost certainly
1	@GeertHub @davidwhogg @jonathansick @adrianprw @exoplaneteer @jradavenport @jegpeek Will bring Oxford coffee.

1	@tim_o_brien @radioastrology @lucyfortson Let's invite @ProfBrianCox too.
1	@tim_o_brien @radioastrology Right. Can we have a Gamma-ray astrology breakout though? cc @LucyFortson
1	@tim_o_brien I'd certainly attend @radioastrology's conference : proper science!
-1	@jradavenport @mrtommyb HAT-P-7b trick?
-1	@jen_gupta @sarahkendrew @astrofairy @vrooje PhD-level jobs are exempt.
1	@spyder_webb No  but I'm sure we'll revisit Rosetta sometime soon.
1	@cloud149 @eteq @arfon Easily fixable. What say you  @AAS_Publishing?
-1	@suziesheehy @vrooje @sarahkendrew I believe @euansmith and the @BBCStargazing team are en route so will shun you for them.
1	@cosmic_horizons I rely on them when in journalist mode for @BBCStargazing  for example.
1	@AstroKatie @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse Whoever does citizen science at ABC
1	@AstroKatie @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse They cloaned @oldweather a few years back too
1	@vrooje @astropixie @kevinschawinski @AstroKatie @galaxyzoo or at least have this project done so results are comparable
1	@astropixie @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse And what's the sample?
1	@astropixie @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse Seriously? Who's the science team?
1	First rule of #skyatnight club : NO PACEMAKERS IN THE PLANETERELLA. At least according to today's call sheet. cc @BBCStargazing
1	@AndreaWiggins @spaceyliz @crowdconsortium @na_case We can show in @SpaceWarps that people either improve or leave after ongoing feedback
1	@jegpeek  I#what I want for outreach on a CV is evidence for creative thinking not just a list of stuff participated in. Is code similar?
1	It helps that there's atmospheric science to be got from that image - tiny haze particles which should make @PlanetDr very happy #PlutoFlyby

1	@stephencwll The left one is the closest to true colour. The right is 'exaggerated colour' - processed to bring out contrasts.
1	@elakdawalla @kennicosmith Will be available on the Sky at Night magazine cover disk (or use what @megschwamb calls 'internet magic')
1	Twitter credits! Don't forget @PlanetDr @CarlyHowett @DrBrianMay as well.  https://t.co/Eed5y7wV13
1	@carlyhowett Really? Don't think we were expecting anything until Friday.
1	@AstroPip I believe they're hoping for useful amount of power until 2030 at least. We will learn lots!
-1	@astropixie @sarahkendrew @drplanet @darrencroton Oops. Should be @PlanetDr #tired #tholins
1	@CRiedlinger77 @BBCStargazing @NASANewHorizons next one coming from an edit suite  I hope
1	@bulletford Very good
1	@astrospike11 @BBCStargazing Yes. But we decided to match the pronunciation the @NewHorizons2015 team are using
1	.@daverothery points out I garble @elakdawalla's thoughts in the last @BBCStargazing vid. Go straight to the source: http://t.co/q6E2jEuHW5
1	@becky1505 @mggtTaylor retweeted. So three of you.
1	@Lil_Richardjohn @BBCStargazing We're still making it. Monday at 10
-1	@NGC3314 @planet4589 @mikamckinnon apparently constraints from Kuiper belt size distribution.
1	@einionyn @toriweaver 'mouldy' has been suggested
1	@daverothery @Andy_666 cab you break ammonia down with the uv flux at Pluto?
1	@NolaTRedd Ah  but those mountains are water ice!
-1	@kennicosmith @elakdawalla I thought that was sharp too. Isn't the problem the odds of such a collision recently v. low?
1	@PlanetDr @horstlab Roger that. Undertaking caffeine acquisition manoeuvre
1	@PlanetDr @horstlab All the things are nominal
1	@PlanetDr We are incoming for our flyby of your lab  hoping to detect Tholins #skyatnight
1	@JPMajor @PlanetDr Tholins over ice
1	@EddieArruza @shaka_lulu @markhammergren So glad you're covering it...
1	A very happy @CarlyHowett explains that EVERYTHING IS EXTREMELY NOMINAL #PLUTO #plutoflyby http://t.co/6Dva3g5T2Z
1	@psutympany Mission Operations Manager
1	@megschwamb Yes  though not about change - just comparison to prediction
1	.@jjbw 'Gunk' was scientifically approved terminology. I checked with @CarlyHowett and everything.
1	@stephencwll Yeah  that's real colour  but at a lower resolution than the detail. So some fudging but basically right.
1	@StephenCWLL Likely tomorrow. BUT The first colour pic from this morning is pretty close to true.
-1	@mggtTaylor @BBCStargazing @AlanStern Not everyone can be bribed with gin
1	@psutympany the latter
-1	@psutympany exaggerated to make difference clearer
1	Some planetary scientists are friendly! With @PlanetDr #plutoflyby http://t.co/t6iHXXEMAK
1	@cosmos4u @BBCStargazing @NASANewHorizons We had 1 in 10000 yesterday. Not sure about difference
1	@PlanetDr Hello! Would be great to catch up
-1	@astronomyblog controversial early call - final result not in until tonight
1	@stopdown555 I think @megschwamb was suggesting that might be the case. Who knows?
1	@marsroverdriver it would be such a shame if all the news coverage focused on that and not on the fact Pluto is awesome
1	@markhardaker yes. He was very proud of knowing Clyde Tombaugh too
1	@Wigwam94 @BBCStargazing thanks!
1	@MGLewis314159 @BBCStargazing BBC say K but NASA Sh for Charon...
1	@planetdr Did you tell the truth about Pluto? #aliens
-1	@astronomyblog Yep. Lack of atmosphere makes it much easier.
1	@megschwamb is that prediction altered by today's announcement of N further away than expected?
1	.@kennicosmith : quality was good - no lingering problems from safe mode. Colour images at higher resolution is 'really good'
1	The entire press corps: What does 'wow' mean? @kennicosmith : 'Fail safe' data reached ground - preflyby data sent as insurance policy
1	@boundangle @StarzanPlanets Yep. People have argued whether it becomes more Eris like later in its orbit
1	@acooray @pruss @StephenSerjeant @davecl42 @BenneHolwerda I don't understand that. Surely incentive to be a better ref if public
1	@alex_parker @bbcstargazing Great. We're on our way over. If you can spare us some time that'd be good - @elakdawalla can vouch for me!
1	@alex_parker Where are you for the flyby? Would be great to talk to you for @BBCStargazing
1	@seanam1310 @bbcstargazing https://t.co/SGP0n74lV4
1	Not long to go now! @BBCStargazing #plutoflyby http://t.co/19dDS4TyzC
1	@astrofairy @UKAstroNut @chrisenorth @zemogle I don't  but outreach is important
1	@becky1505 @vrooje @jen_gupta Clearly the message is working with @the_zooniverse is good for your career #NAM2015
1	@mggtTaylor @UnofficialNAM Why am I not surprised that you found the bunch of people I know well to drink with at NAM?
1	@SungrazerComets @jjaron Better. That would be fine
1	@jjaron @SungrazerComets I do think they could and should have added independent comment though
-1	@jjaron @SungrazerComets it's difficult. It's by authors of an accepted talk at conference.Should press office have refused a release?
-1	@sungrazercomets If it had been promoted as speculation it'd be ok….It's the 'evidence for' which slipped in that's wrong.
-1	@sungrazercomets Blame the journalists for biting.
-1	@sungrazercomets I feel a bit sorry for the @RoyalAstroSoc on this one. Talk was accepted - what are they supposed to do  further review?
1	Follow @DrJoVian for the real comet news from #NAM2015. Exciting results from @philae_ptolemy - my guess is breakdown of larger molecules…
1	@msbentley @philae_ptolemy @guardian @independent 'Leading' not 'Top' researchers this time. Sigh.
-1	@exmamaku @ras_outreach @drjovian @adamrutherford @royalastrosoc It's a talk  this afternoon. I missed it on the program.
1	@tomkerss Right  but no science in safe mode
-1	@davidgalvin9 I'm so sorry. It was the pressure that did it.
1	@ericloyd @unknownsymmetry We don't know.
1	@unknownsymmetry Yes  but not sure that means it was primary cause…
1	@cosmic_carol If it was off course.
-1	@mrtommyb Yes! Completely agreed. We're £50 but I'm hideously embarrassed by that.
1	Just catching up with this - good on @space_mog for having the guts to change her mind : http://t.co/WyksifEELg
1	@monkleyg No idea! Try @BBCStargazing
1	@michaelaye @henrymance @ARothNYT in a restaurant?
-1	Philae talks again - suspect @mggtTaylor and co need to get @ESA_Rosetta into the optimal position to get more.  https://t.co/rbBilH3Rbr
1	@Bliadhnaichean @BBCStargazing @Philae2014 @ESA_Rosetta Program is being reedited - this is extra
1	@sikaheimo @BBCStargazing @Philae2014 @AstroEmz @ESA_Rosetta Both.
-1	@ed_davies @mggtTaylor sorry  made a mess of this! Matt is right  of course
-1	@dstndstn @GeertHub @aallan @davidwhogg Weirdly the lack of time is an @esa thing. We decided to echo the team's use but agree it's odd
1	@dstndstn @GeertHub @aallan Sure. There's an implied time unit.
1	@dstndstn @GeertHub @aallan I think that's the accumulated power available.
1	@dallascampbell which reminds me - here's Observatory Pinafore http://t.co/2atTdTkP7A
1	@ProfMike_M Definitely. Turns out everything is solved
1	@aallan Stuck with @united so far  but as I'm in Chicago less that may not make much sense…
-1	@aallan Have they got worse again?
1	@IndrayaniG @dallascampbell @Dr_Lucie Four! But who's counting? Thanks for all your help
1	@PenguinGalaxy I've read that your mate Cecilia was fond of puns - have you come across any examples?
-1	@gsnarayan @EmExAstris @LSST Of course. But that's not great for @nasa PR.
-1	@EmExAstris @gsnarayan I'm worried about JWST for this reason. As it's 'Hubble's successor' people will expect pretty pictures
1	@eteq Happy to give advice if needed.
1	@laurheth @gsnarayan Recent @royalastrosoc survey gives a slightly different picture on LGBT (though not all good) http://t.co/KyelPkb0Jm
1	.@dallascampbell So looking forward to #bbcsciencezone top trumps. Been training with Sir Norman... http://t.co/ulpeJpPfmS
-1	@kevinschawinski @ngc3314 That's an incredibly hard problem. It's the need to find not only testable but interesting hypotheses that's tough
1	@FitzsimmonsAlan which one?
1	@alisonatkin @hannahdev He didn't have approval from his university's ethics board  so wasn't allowed access to raw data.
1	@royalastrosoc @stephenserjeant @kevinschawinski We asked for the first ever @galaxyzoo paper and were pointed to an acknowledgement.
-1	@AdrianSpalinky I suspect it makes no sense without my words...
1	@shaka_lulu @github Every time anyone says that at a scientific meeting @arfon drinks.
-1	@gsnarayan @caseyjlaw @ebellm Do we really have scalability problems  though? What's maximum use (minus citizens) - a few hundred people?
1	@shaka_lulu I’d wondered what that noise was…
-1	@unknownsymmetry Nonsense  almost certainly - see https://t.co/ZwnKycemlr and links therein.
1	@alisonkestrel @kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @kejames @doctorzen @eye_wire http://t.co/4oCv2F9280 is the paper you're thinking of.
1	@JLGalache did you find beer?
1	Hearing about the Supernova Exchange  led me to this as the second hit on Google : http://t.co/SPjGgSJjNo #hotwiredIV cc @shaka_lulu
1	@sondy @gsnarayan @minorplanetctr Didn't catch - a small fraction  anyway (though an important one).
1	@andreawiggins @vanhyningv Well  I'd argue that that would have been a better goal than whatever these activities are about.
1	@spaceyliz 'braincrack' - avoiding building the possible because of the love of thinking about the perfect.
1	.@andreawiggins Citizen science is exciting to me precisely because of the potential to change people's relationship to science. #crowdcon
1	@jim_salmons @andreawiggins @tjowens I don't think we're disagree about much  except that I see few truly 'easy' wins (&amp; in truth few wins)
-1	@jim_salmons @andreawiggins @tjowens I'm more worried funders will push for complexity before we've sorted the basics. #crowdcon
1	@spaceyliz A majority of @oxfordphysics Astrophysics DPhil students participated in @the_zooniverse while at school  too...
1	@spaceyliz Self-report - ~80% of volunteers seek out more scientific content after participation.
1	@andreawiggins @jim_salmons @tjowens …entry level task then good scaffolding for further use &amp; inquiry. 3/3 #crowdcon
1	@andreawiggins @jim_salmons @tjowens …those who aren't ready to think of themselves as scholars. Ideal project has easy… #crowdcon 2/3
1	@andreawiggins @jim_salmons @tjowens I don't agree.If you don't start with a simple  convincing  authentic task then you lose… #crowdcon 1/3
1	@jegpeek @reneehlozek I read that hashtag as something to do with @joezuntz
1	@andreawiggins Sure. But platforms for non-software people are needed. Happy with plural!
1	@andreawiggins Or building a system so people can get going themselves….
-1	@andreawiggins Well  it's not project directories that people want. It's technical info &amp; help. We are overwhelmed by people wanted to chat
1	@andreawiggins And as soon as someone funds a couple of members of staff for community outreach we'd be happy to help #crowdcon
1	@megschwamb Weeks.
1	@susan_snowy Sadly not - real world gets in the way. Have fun!
-1	How many bits of the sadly destroyed CLUSTER satellites are around the world? Here's @msslspacelab's cc @mggtTaylor http://t.co/VBp06GKruH
-1	@GeertHub in my opinion projects need to set out to solve specific problems. Generalise too early and you will get lost...
1	I stand corrected! (&amp; yes  Lurking at @msslspacelab today) RT @PlanetAndrewC: @mggtTaylor @Dr_Lucie comet-solar wind interaction  from 1986!
1	@jen_gupta you're in Oxford?
1	@drarnakarick @SciBry No website but proceedings soon. Shout (chris@zooniverse.org) if you’d like to talk about code for your workshop.
1	@karenlmasters @scibry @jen_gupta There is a cocktail bar with an excellent selection of gin en route to dinner.
-1	@DClaphamFRAS @Tim_O_Brien nonsense. Have you read the other manifestos? Also  how would UKIP replace EU FP7 funding?
1	@DClaphamFRAS @Tim_O_Brien right  and the universities fund that with what? Harry Potter magic?
1	@kwwillett @robertcnichol I sort of wish he’d left at that point  job done. (Not really  Bob  nice to see you) #kavlicitsci
-1	@RobertMMassey @Tim_O_Brien Absolutely. Would be a nightmare.
-1	@tim_o_brien Ask them - I was interested that intense mockery of their plan to build a British Space Shuttle caused a change.
1	@megschwamb First we must proceed  but yes  I hope so #kavlicitsci
1	Change of focus today : the future of astronomical citizen science at #kavlicitsci w. @SciBry  @robertcnichol  @KarenLMasters et al
1	@cain_rob I'm not sure that's right. We can derive estimates of uncertainty from the range of responses so don't need 'I don't know's
1	@jen_gupta Absolutely. Maybe come up to Oxford sometime next month?
-1	@ferrarif50lover to be fair to @megschwamb and @lcjohnso the abuse was mostly mine. I have to work tomorrow though...
-1	@AdlerPlanet They're definitely stable. The question is whether the disk from which it formed could have been stable - that's the mystery.
1	@AdlerPlanet there are some low res simulations but I hope someone is doing it properly. Would be great to watch it form.
-1	@albertfeynman Don't ruin the punchline! (Actually - answer is 'sort of  maybe')
1	@geerthub Are you allowed to distribute that?
1	@demitrimuna I've asked - they said 'It hasn't been through the NASA Open Source Process so isn't  and might not be'.
1	@jonathansick @geerthub @astrofrog On the other hand  if surveys hosted their images &amp; data on S3 or equivalent anyone could use them.
1	@geerthub Does AWS not have a good solution?

1	@dallascampbell I use http://t.co/Mj1BNFvnoZ who are fast (and in Luton)
1	That's @BBCStargazing done. Today is all about @stargazingoxford - if you can  come and join us at Keble Road. @becky1505 &amp; I are en route!
1	@d_mateer it was @mggtTaylor
1	@letaylor77 Yes  but in a bit - will be on @BBCStargazing live later and then will write something up.

1	@astronomyblog I think so
1	@einionyn Yep. We'll see what happens!

1	@FitzsimmonsAlan Nice work!
-1	@cosmos4u what's the problem?
1	@robmliddell @mggttaylor Rob  are you spending the day following @bbcstargazing vicariously on Twitter? Sure we could use you…
1	Morning all! Lots of excitement from the @bbcstargazing about our http://t.co/fZavf7hnob discoveries from last night. More data coming…
1	@corvaxia We're back. Some wobbles but we're doing better than last year!
1	@blobrana Should be back now!
1	@the_cardman @bbcstargazing @bbcskyatnight Depends how many more stories Buzz has…
1	I love that @bbcstargazing now has @Dr_Lucie and @dallascampbell as well as the usual suspects!
1	@jen_gupta @mrniaboc @bbcstargazing Nothing so grand. It's room LV40 off the old library…
1	@bulletford Yep  see you there
1	@SarahScience1 @statto @BBCStargazing Yes  and we hope to extend this to the whole sky. This is just a first go
1	Off to @BBCStargazing via @bbcoxford. Don't forget to send us your Orion pictures! http://t.co/XtxkrUvHaz
1	@aallan I've been wondering that too…
1	@astronomyblog @megschwamb @BBCStargazing in theory  Friday morning. But the more processing we can do early the better!
1	@paulknightley Thank you. Can you upload to the @bbcstargazing Flickr group so our software can grab it?
1	@geerthub We'll see what happens. It's very much an experiment (on a prime time TV show!)
1	@cosmos4u @bbcstargazing Any  and all. Yes.
1	A reminder that we need pictures of Orion for @BBCStargazing - thousands of images needed  and they don't have to be great in themselves.
1	@this_is_the_sea @bbcstargazing Definitely not.
1	@davidbflower @bbcstargazing That's the idea!
1	@dawnsunrise1 Nope  anywhere will do.

1	@dawnsunrise1 The more up to date the better  but if you can get us started with your archive ones that'll do nicely.
1	@fabulousmrg  @sarahcruddas We would only find aliens that were more technically advanced than us. At least a century. #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas It's a PRIVILEGE to be able to work on a really big question ... are we alone. Bye all. #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute It's exploration. Societies that don't explore  don't last very long. #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas Well  better than my high school chums. But they might be machine intelligence. I think that's likely. #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas A cup of coffee says ... within two decades! Prepare thyself! #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas Believe it or not  easiest might be Saturn's moon Enceladus! #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas @thehighfrontier One thing it doesn't cover is interstellar colonization. Maybe the Klingons have an empire. #spacediscovery
-1	@sarahcruddas Of course  no one can afford to check out ALL those places  sadly.  #spacediscovery
-1	@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute Check out Mars  Europa  Enceladus  Titan  Ganymede  and Callisto.  I doubt you'll come up dry. #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas @Jahrtt In my opinion  we've looked at too few star systems. Gotta cover more territory ... #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute And then we'd build bigger antennas to look for a message. #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute The first thing that happens is that our parking lot would be jammed by TV trucks! #spacediscovery
-1	@sarahcruddas @iamandyhilton One-third of the public thinks they're visiting Earth.  Highly controversial. #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas @thehighfrontier Hah! Good question. Everyone does their own thing.  Not a bad approach for exploration. #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas @iamandyhilton We try eavesdropping on radio signals. If we find 'em  we'd try to understand the message. #spacediscovery
-1	@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute If we're alone  we're a MIRACLE.  Scientists are wary of miracles. #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute There are 100 000 trillion planets. Not likely all are sterile. #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas @SETIInstitute We look for life in space ... whether you're talking about dumb microbes or clever aliens! #spacediscovery
1	@sarahcruddas I've got some hot coffee  and my eyes are open!
1	Few of us can go into space  but the new book from @arielwaldman can be the next best thing. https://t.co/1Tt30DKht6

1	@arielwaldman I NEVER look awesome  Ariel!! Hey  when I'm back in CA  I'd like to ask you something ... next week?
1	@arielwaldman @mattb Amazing  Ariel!   Well  more congratulations!
1	@arielwaldman Well  I just got back from 2-1/2 weeks in southern Africa. Terrific.  You'll have a great time.  Don't have TOO good a time .
1	@arielwaldman  Well  this had to make your flight more miserable than it might otherwise have been.  How was Madagascar?  Africa was fab.
1	@arielwaldman @SethShostak @VirginAmerica
1	@arielwaldman @SethShostak @BadAstronomer @ScienceChannel
1	@soledadobrien interesting it's the same ratio with resilience investment in natural disaster prevention.
1	@omcintyre NICE!!!!
1	@GenAnthropocene @Geo_Miles Very slow clap  unfolding over millennia...
1	@AndrewNCassidy @NewHorizons2015 @elakdawalla No! On to encounter with another small object on New Years Day 2019!!
1	@atomcluborg @astromarkmarley :-)
1	@JeffMakos1 @MoonZappa dude.
1	@Paladin1969 @RawCassini Or make a phonograph record from the digitized grooves &amp; try it...
1	@JeffMakos1 thanks. that would be great.
1	@JeffMakos1 Yes: https://t.co/rybB5L3TUK
1	@Babydok123 Thank you!!
1	@JeffMakos1 @dailykos Thank you  sir!
1	@Paladin1969 Thanks!
1	@Paleophile @dailykos Thanks!
1	@aprilfollies @AscendingNode @Wikisteff or did once...
1	@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @DavidBrin @chucknicecomic thx!
1	@makc3d @HiRISE yes - deliberately picked original version here for historical post!
1	@markmccaughrean @3Dmattias @elakdawalla see also  the book I did w Marov https://t.co/2swv1UeOx4
1	@JetTheFurry ha!
1	@Paleophile oh geeez
1	@DrMRFrancis That explains it!
-1	@Wraythe68 @NASA @ESA_EDM @esa Yes  it is sad.
1	@DrMRFrancis big head!
1	@DrMRFrancis If we swapped hats AND glasses frames we could seriously mess with our friends...
1	@DrMRFrancis medium
1	@fwd79 @StarTalkRadio @DavidBrin @SETIInstitute thank you  kind sir!
1	@PlanetDr ahhh wish I was there w you guys...
1	@lorengrush fingers crossed...
1	@call_him_bob @ESA_ExoMars OK I'll go. But I'm not int the one-way trip idea...
1	@brianwolven yes  definitely.
1	@brianwolven Huh. Interesting!
1	@brianwolven ??
1	@MasoomJethwa @nytimes 2 new NASA missions under study  one or both *might* get selected later this year  for launch several years later...
1	@Paleophile this is perfect for the start of NBA season…!
1	@plutosavior @NewHorizons2015 I’m in.
-1	@numinouscosmos @tomtomorrow could definitely achieve carbon neutral or negative intercontinental travel if we weren’t in such a damn hurry!
1	@numinouscosmos @tomtomorrow we should revive that mode of travel. With a different lifting gas...
1	@markmccaughrean @DrCadence Ah  cool.  Thanks!!!
1	@GerardoBarbosa probably scattered.
-1	@elakdawalla @ESA_EDM Yes but if it succeeds  it’s not *too* sad…
1	@mousegle @tom_schober Yes. Imagine...
-1	@Robotbeat @ElevenPointTwo @amytoast I haven’t done any comparing  just noticed the decline in user experience w @apple
1	@ElevenPointTwo @amytoast @Apple for decades I loved their products. Now loyalty is like that to a drug pusher - I’m hooked &amp; they know it.
-1	@ElevenPointTwo @amytoast @Apple Yes  exactly. And I’m completely dependent on iTunes. As it declines  I wish I wasn’t.
1	@ElevenPointTwo @amytoast @Apple @itserikadassit I’m on a 6 something. But also laptop -notice this change in attitude in all their products
1	@amytoast @ElevenPointTwo @Apple Apple seems to have made some unfortunate transition away from making things easy to pushing us around.
1	@DrMRFrancis Ha!!

1	@soledadobrien or as a recent Nobel Laureate once said “Don’t follow leaders and watch your parking meters…"
1	Talking about EARTH IN HUMAN HANDS with Congressional staffers this AM. &amp; @nccomfort spoke about origin of life. https://t.co/W8i4IDFjaw
1	@atomcluborg @DavidBrin @chucknicecomic @StarTalkRadio hmmmm.....
1	@plutosavior @planetarysci I don't know if it was recorded. I can send you my slides if you want.
1	@AdamFrank4 That’s some good guidance!
1	@samooja @elakdawalla a couple of missions are under consideration...
1	@AdamFrank4 I got a parental lecture at about that age: reading too much sci fi  not enough other stuff...
1	@omcintyre @Slate less than a blip in the cosmic scheme (one hopes...)

1	@omcintyre Yes me too - its been years but such a memorable experience! (My best sighting was in Alaska)
1	@omcintyre yeah  no kidding!
1	@nccomfort @barbkiser https://t.co/EQYRf0DNv2
1	@Babydok123 wow.
1	@TomChivers @SlagOffTwits yes I was approaching same conclusion... (But not the *old* sense  hanging out under bridges...)
1	@barbkiser @nccomfort indeed! A genre I love but in small "doses"...
1	@SlagOffTwits @TomChivers @ClimateOfGavin I don't think you've read Lovelock's last few books.
1	@TomChivers @SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin indeed I thought that's what we were discussing.
1	@barbkiser @nccomfort yes preposterous. Some scenes are quite fun but it was hard to watch whole thing!
1	@TomChivers @SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin he was visionary when developed "geophysiology" before began high amplitude futurology oscillation
1	@barbkiser @nccomfort yes  that was brilliant. But the film is  um  uh  hmmm....
1	@SlagOffTwits have you read his books?
1	@SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin @TomChivers no neither extreme is helpful. "We are certainly doomed" and "no problem at all" from same person?
1	@SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin @TomChivers mind you this is after his hugely important and valuable career as I stated in my first comment.
-1	@SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin @TomChivers No the problem is radical inconsistency with a seeming commitment only to flouting mainstream view
-1	@barbkiser @nccomfort weirdest film Groucho appeared in: Skidoo https://t.co/dNnXY3bj3o
1	@SlagOffTwits @ClimateOfGavin @TomChivers He can’t decide in which direction he wants to break ranks so he keeps switching extremes.
1	@barbkiser @nccomfort Almost the right order here... https://t.co/jeEF28Jwju

1	@iyzie @asrivkin @DarkandWondrous @chrislhayes @NateSilver538 close margins in some swing states. Pence reassures those who want actual r
1	@iyzie @asrivkin @DarkandWondrous @chrislhayes @NateSilver538 obviously but they are competing for those Rs wondering if they can vote Trump
-1	@asrivkin @DarkandWondrous @chrislhayes I think @NateSilver538 just nailed it: Pence setting himself up to win debate &amp; lose post debate.
1	@asrivkin @DarkandWondrous @chrislhayes true. &amp; @JoyAnnReid just pointed out  Pence may be running for 2020
1	@DarkandWondrous @asrivkin @chrislhayes that may be it. Cause Kaine is not doing well if he's trying to seem more presidential.
-1	@AstroCook @AscendingNode Kaine is obviously winning if you listen. But losing if you watch. Which is more important.
1	@DrMRFrancis It’s a fantastic quote from a true genius!
1	@DrMRFrancis Except for those who are consciously! (great quote from Monk)
1	@Mad_Science_Guy In this context it was “interesting”.
-1	@Paladin1969 @brianwolven @seanmcarroll @asrivkin I feel bad for my original assumption. Yet I see that sentiment (non sarcastically) often!
1	@brianwolven @asrivkin @seanmcarroll All cat videos boil down to a few goofy yet furry moves. Amiright?
-1	@brianwolven @asrivkin now I am defending @seanmcarroll against those complaining to me his sarcasm is misplaced!
1	@brianwolven @seanmcarroll @asrivkin seems a valuable signifier  as this conversation indicates!
1	@AdamFrank4 @JoelAchenbach Never say never but yes that could hide the biospheric richness of the cosmos for a long time!
1	@AdamFrank4 @JoelAchenbach should be some w "internal biospheres" but on those world's with air would they not betray themselves?
-1	@AdamFrank4 @JoelAchenbach interesting idea. We are profoundly ignorant about relationship between planets &amp; life!
1	@dsfpspacefl1ght @tedstryk @JoelAchenbach yes and yes!
1	@dsfpspacefl1ght @JoelAchenbach Earth is deeply altered by life. More than 2/3 of minerals are biogenic. N  S  C cycles etc. Living world.
1	@nourtra00456201 me neither!!
-1	@dsfpspacefl1ght @JoelAchenbach europa promising because of geophysical vigor: black smokers  tidal energy etc. Mars  geologically is dead.
1	@dsfpspacefl1ght @JoelAchenbach life on earth depends upon geological vigor. My hunch Mars is dead. But I support search to test hypothesis!
1	@dsfpspacefl1ght @JoelAchenbach most of earth history atmosphere participated in life &amp; life was a widely globalized phenomenon.

1	@Paleophile tempting!
1	@wormhole_raider @ThomsonJared @AdamFrank4 anen
1	@ThomsonJared @AdamFrank4 @NPR @Revkin yes. Good thing we aren't viruses!
1	@ThomsonJared @AdamFrank4 @NPR @Revkin viruses do not discuss their potential futures. Humans have learned &amp; reinvented themselves in past.

1	@DrMRFrancis @GeoSciTweeps machines will be better at this than we are  once they take over.
-1	@GeoSciTweeps @DrMRFrancis Ooops!  I am terrified that I am going to turn in a column and later realize I already wrote it 3 years ago.
1	@DrMRFrancis Ever find yourself wondering if you’ve already written a piece or just imagined it? That happens to me w my Sky &amp; Tel columns.
1	@TrueSciPhi curious how u decide who is a writer or scientist or both? (thx)
1	@thomassturm @Robotbeat @chrisadams2112 I am optimistic that his schedule is optimistic by at least a decade.
1	@thomassturm @Robotbeat @chrisadams2112 yes  this is a paradox. There is no way to be completely careful. Nobody knows what is enough...
1	@Robotbeat @chrisadams2112 @Slate you should see the piece I just wrote for @SkyandTelescope ...
1	@call_him_bob @NatureAstronomy Hard to say  but judging from craters there was always a wide range of sizes.
-1	@SLaBouchardiere Well  it IS scary… but not by any means hopeless!
1	@GeoSciTweeps mine too! My 2 best pals from grad school  though we were growed up post-docs by Neptune...

1	@CraftLass @tim846 I live in DC but get to NYC a lot. May be there for week or 2 soon to record audiobook of EARTH IN HUMAN HANDS...
-1	@CraftLass @tim846 ah unfortunately have to fly to DC in the AM tomorrow... :-/
1	@plutosavior that could work. The Naval Observatory looks like a cool place to live...
1	@ElevenPointTwo @TheEarthStory 100 is the new 50...
1	@Sr_Tresillo @alexwitze no! Planet name came first!
1	@CraftLass @tim846 👍👍🚀🚀🎶🎶
1	@tim846 @CraftLass sounds good to me!
1	@ClimateOfGavin @TheEarthStory yes &amp; we know the density very well &amp; therefore more or less the composition.
1	@TheEarthStory @ClimateOfGavin yes. &amp; Possible local residual impact heat around Tombaugh Regio?
-1	@ClimateOfGavin @TheEarthStory mostly radioactive decay.
1	@carolynporco @JaneGoodallInst Yes indeed she is a shining example. And also very lovely in person.
1	@PlanetDr @chrisgeidner pfffff
-1	@CruzTruckseries often appallingly bad. The most amazing stories &amp; discoveries but little ability to connect. Ever try watching NASA TV? Zzz
1	@hansolofsven it seems to be there...
-1	@PlanetDr I'll miss it too cause I'll be on a flight  so I posted my reaction yesterday. 😬
1	@hansolofsven @Peter_Grinspoon long as there are no Klingons!
1	@numinouscosmos @JaneGoodallInst Yup! And she kissed me!
1	@carolynporco @numinouscosmos My mind is going.  I can feel it  Dave...

1	@carolynporco @FolkertWierda @GerardoBarbosa @neiltyson CP you will have a blast re-reading. You know they go to Saturn not Jupiter &amp; they
1	@carolynporco @FolkertWierda @GerardoBarbosa @neiltyson Yes &amp; the book of 2001 also has some great stuff not in the film!
1	@scorrice Yes! Packing and unpacking  while basically a pain  has its joyful little surprises...
1	@TheEarthStory neither extreme is viable given the data. If all gradually there would be more partially embayed craters  palimpsests  etc.
1	@FolkertWierda @carolynporco @GerardoBarbosa @neiltyson the book is wonderful too. Lots of cool stuff that didn't make it into the film.
1	@sondy opponents of METI will be pleased...
1	@sondy meaning it can receive but not transmit?
1	@sondy Why that is Buckaroo Banzai - Nuclear Physicist  Brain Surgeon and Rock Star!!!
1	@PlanetDr Yes we cannot hide our inner natures!
1	@LarryNittler makes sense to me.
1	@PlanetDr Nice!
1	@numinouscosmos best to always be prepared…
1	@Paladin1969 uh oh...
1	@DavidBflower :-)
1	@JeffMakos1 that is certainly one possibility!

1	@soledadobrien are you on the Jefferson Airplane?
1	@coreyspowell @SarahEFecht @PeterDEdmonds yes!
1	@SarahEFecht @PeterDEdmonds that's a really good idea!
1	@pensgooner @PeterDEdmonds @SarahEFecht it is a fine line...
-1	@pensgooner @PeterDEdmonds @SarahEFecht Well it *does* generate a lot of interest in their press conf. &amp; the speculation doesn’t really hurt
1	@PsychSailor @AstrobiologyTop Agreed!!
1	@Annaleen Clearly!
1	@Annaleen I cannot Parse that abstract.
1	@call_him_bob https://t.co/C1k9zPCtKt
-1	@Ghroznak I think it's more the remnants of the stellar explosion that created this nebula.
1	@Wildlebendes I was actually thinking of writing something on it...
1	@atomcluborg happy to sign one - both hard copy &amp; ebook out on 12/6!!
-1	@Robotbeat @SLaBouchardiere arguably that alone would make us something very different...
1	@ClimateOfGavin @jamesannan @RachelFeltman yes exactly.
1	@atomcluborg coming soon: pub date is Dec 6th on all platforms!!!
-1	@docdailey what we’ve learned about life since Sagan arguably pushes probabilities upward - extremophiles...
1	@docdailey we have no basis to say that. We really don’t know.
1	@docdailey until natural explanation its fun to speculate. There is a peer reviewed literature of such predictions by very smart scientists.
1	@mustapipa @docdailey I mean how do you feel about possible biosignatures? could make exact same critique. Fairy tale. Must be natural exp.
1	@mustapipa @docdailey It fits a prediction in an interesting way. Not unjustified if carefully qualified  which it was in published paper.
1	@docdailey @mustapipa History goes to Freeman Dyson  Carl Sagan  Frank Drake  etc. All said was *possible* &amp; unlikely in any specific case.
-1	@docdailey @mustapipa I was referring to @mustapipa who claims to know what is possible and impossible &amp; ridicules other scientists.
1	@mustapipa @docdailey “don’t consider it likely”. Neither do I. But there is a literature of such predictions and reasonable to examine.
1	@mustapipa @docdailey Unless you have special knowledge of what kind of evolution is permitted elsewhere. Did you get from a stone tablet?
1	@mustapipa @docdailey you could say same about a possible biosignature. Responsible to consider it but require more evidence.
1	@docdailey @mustapipa if assumption is it can't ever be life  then you will never find it.
1	@docdailey @mustapipa yes but reasonable to discuss possible bio signatures. &amp; possible techno signatures.

1	@GerardoBarbosa @bdorminey to some degree  perhaps. But there is a substantial atmosphere above this level that would absorb a lot.
1	@Paleophile @SAPIENS_org good stuff!
1	@Paleophile wow this is great!
1	Man Who Was Mistaken for Homo sapiens in a Hat. by @Paleophile on possible reasons 4 human Neanderthal interbreeding https://t.co/dvA0KU8yJY
1	@Paleophile yes. I have a large framed print of voyager image of Jupiter. But not this one w Io.
1	@dan_anger thx - great to see you.
1	@POOetryman @JimJlr2 @KellieRoseWick both
1	@JimJlr2 @POOetryman @KellieRoseWick yes Dyson sphere wouldn't behave like that. some other structure? Ringworld or multiple constructions?
1	@POOetryman @KellieRoseWick yes a second one.
1	@JeffMakos1 @MoonZappa praise be!
1	@hansolofsven quite possibly!
1	@hansolofsven maybe.
1	@hansolofsven yes I think so  but until we have an explanation everything is on the table.
1	@awgonnerman @TomLevenson Yes!!
1	@PutoAstronauta yup
1	@awgonnerman @TomLevenson your experience here is more relevant than my degrees. I did read that  but I’m no expert...
1	@awgonnerman @TomLevenson apparently it is not uncommon to see an avian radar signal like this at the dawn.
1	@DaveBngDave @capitalweather @MrsWheelbarrow no it was extraordinary!
-1	@dePlantagenet @PeterDEdmonds “I want to hear the scream of the butterfly!” - Jim Morrison
1	@PeterDEdmonds yes its worth pointing out that these are not the same as pressure waves. But beyond that analogy is pretty good.
1	@SJRogue @michaelaranger Yes.
1	@michaelaranger the bottom of the sea. But first: Are you experienced?
1	@michaelaranger yes. Exactly. “If you can just get your mind together then come along with me. We’ll hold hands and watch the sun rise from
1	@Richardhurst19 yes. It seems to be active. We need new missions to determine for sure &amp; how active.
1	@EricFielding @Eaterofsun @DKeithClimate @KenCaldeira @Revkin @GernotWagner @dotearth If they had a space program we could ask them.
1	@EricFielding @Eaterofsun @DKeithClimate @KenCaldeira @Revkin @GernotWagner @dotearth How do u know? they didn’t have cities or write books
-1	@lyndalovon @KenCaldeira @ClimateBook @dotearth Ugh! Why’d you have to bring *him* into this?
1	@mggtTaylor @ESA_Rosetta Tricky  and exciting. You are doing great work. We are watching and appreciating!
1	@verbiscer @volcanopele @asrivkin John has the best memory of anyone I know. So he’s probably right.
1	@Science_Hooker Love it! Also this: https://t.co/yGS9azxOzw
1	@Annaleen wow! Now I too am “inspired” by your browsing history...
1	@verbiscer @asrivkin Legend!
1	@verbiscer @asrivkin is that gene Shoemaker behind Buck?
1	@asrivkin @verbiscer &amp; Kargel  Buck Janes  Basilevsky...
1	@verbiscer love it!!
1	@Summer_Ash @LDMay they are better? Good to know.
1	@LDMay @Summer_Ash sweet!
-1	@LDMay @Summer_Ash I do miss the legroom when I fly. &amp; the upgrades. Oh  wait...
1	@Summer_Ash @LDMay I actually *lost* my Premier status this year. Which if you think about it  is a significant lifestyle upgrade.
1	@PlanetDr @LDMay yes  true. &amp; I complain w the best (or worst of em) But sometimes we forget how privileged we are (&amp; must seem 2 others)
1	@Planetguy_Bln @airfrance good point!
1	@AussiePhinatic ask away &amp; Ill respond if I can. Also my Venus book is pretty good  and mostly up to date. https://t.co/m8MdRS38u1
-1	@IbnulHussaini yeah  really not smart.
1	@AussiePhinatic only in my head.. 
1	@Valgren6 @asrivkin @jtuttlekeane @UALPL @Mikey_Nolan @smallplanets I love that picture even though I'm a bit flat in it. What a crew!
1	@PutoAstronauta @StarTalkRadio yes we are going to do some more episodes!
1	@PutoAstronauta Phew!!
1	@PutoAstronauta Which 2???
1	@DrMRFrancis They are thrilling! Glad you’re going. Wish I was…
1	@DrMRFrancis No. Should be  but… work.
1	Um  so this is #Mars! &amp; there are LOTS of incredible new pics in this @HiRISE catalog update https://t.co/InMHqV8qmA https://t.co/JqVXsa2hAa
1	@DavidBflower yes!
1	@mousegle yes. Chilling.
1	@numinouscosmos @carolynporco @VealSlab All of the above?
1	@carolynporco @VealSlab yeah divine revelation would be great if it worked  but...
-1	@VealSlab @carolynporco That would be living hell!
1	@carolynporco There’s even this - from 4.1 (!!) But  I dunno. Hadean  not a nice place  wouldn’t want to live there https://t.co/HQkqNFwHnK
1	@AdamFrank4 Yes @MGleiser is a wonderful writer!
1	@rappolee @carolynporco good question. T tolerance found  not sure if there are markers for P
1	@carolynporco Yes. Very cool if it holds up! Some already put earliest evidence at 3.8 from isotopes but fossils more concrete (or rocky!)
1	@Paleophile @mattrussell_PhD @TeagWall shows how much I know.
1	@carolynporco Life may have arisen at ocean vent.  LUCA = thermophile. Date of last ocean-evaporator unknown. So - a range of possibility.
1	@mattrussell_PhD @TeagWall maybe @paleophile ?
1	@EllenStofan your other home town?
1	@planetjuneberry @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson :-)
1	@codydschultz @HiRISE in part optical illusion - I believe little landslides going down the opposite slope. There’s a paper on it -must find
-1	@codydschultz @HiRISE Yes!!! Weird freeze-thaw  landslide structures near the south pole...
1	@WeiPoints @hannahjwaters @SmithsonianMag Cool!
1	@Peter_Grinspoon @GerardoBarbosa I’m as free as a Spoonbird now...
1	@ECroydon :-) Thx!
1	@GerardoBarbosa @Peter_Grinspoon yeah  it is up there.
-1	@alexwitze @roseveleth @ffwdpod @PlanetDr @AllPlanets @CarlyHowett OK  I don’t know if I’m the weirdest  but I have been called strange...
1	@MarsMaven @SkyandTelescope Good find!
1	@ArlenKundert @StarTalkRadio @tourtheuniverse @chucknicecomic :-)
1	The @HiRISE camera on #Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is the gift that keeps on giving! https://t.co/ZSAJPi8Ecn https://t.co/Uhq8bZ9Cac
1	@tim846 @BBCNewshour can’t wait to have you read it &amp; know what you think…!
1	@ozaed probably  but worth checking out if only to rule out.
1	@QuakeAlarmMex I hope you like it!
1	@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames we need a Ramones version!
1	@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames group hug?
-1	@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames while we're being civil  I apologize for snarky "7 sins" comment. Based on headline only. Undeserved
1	@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames thank you.
1	@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames is indeed interesting info but headline &amp; intro slightly misleading or clickbaity is all.
1	@brianwolven thank you for sharing that.
-1	@canislatrans @mattrussell_PhD @kejames Not good metric: these are all conflated &amp; species loss is only one (important) measure of severity.
-1	@mattrussell_PhD @kejames @canislatrans yes. Silly. "Let's rank the 7 deadly sins! Click here to see what's worse than murder!"
1	@roselique party planet!
1	@Robotbeat yes. A more honest world...
-1	@sandygrains Yes! Terrible twos would be over in weeks  teenagers would only be annoying for a month  &amp; everybody would get wise fast!!
-1	@evandawson @AdamFrank4 if I had to guess  it's easier to survive in the game. Though I confess I haven't visited either world yet...
1	@numinouscosmos Can’t wait to hear what you think!
1	@Paladin1969 can't wait till it's out &amp; you can!
1	@nccomfort @KlugeCtr @carlzimmer can't wait!
1	@prezcannady @Robotbeat that sucks - Sunday's the best day for Dim sum!
1	@prezcannady @Robotbeat and I want cookies!!!
-1	@Paladin1969 Oh well yes there’s that but I don’t think they need to worry about puny humans and their pathetic weapons!
1	@Paladin1969 Absolutely good to realize and recognize our unity through contrast to *actual* aliens...
1	@nourtra00456201 Yes - some inspiring individuals!
1	@masequeira1 Yes indeed - nice to be reminded of the possibility. And  one of these days...
1	@AsteroidEnergy agreed. Needs to be confirmed by other observatories.
-1	@tan123 Nobody thinks that 400 ppm on its own is causing mass extinction. Convergence of habitat loss  climate change   acidification etc.
-1	@Paladin1969 @codydschultz Yes  that worries me a great deal.
-1	@tan123 what the hell? Do you just enjoy attacking scientists and telling them their work is no good? Were you mistreated as a child? Sorry.
1	@tan123 Interesting question. Any humans anywhere on Earth? Don’t know. Could imagine poles just cool enough to hang on. Need food too.
1	@BenMakesTV Pub date is December 6.
-1	@tan123 Silly. Willful misinterpretation or great ignorance?
1	@planetjuneberry @DocAmen for my last book I was interviewed by @nprscottsimon It was a wonderful experience! https://t.co/EHNN7LLUDa
1	@brianwolven @theothervoices @drfunkyspoon I think u could market such a thing if it wouldn’t mess up microwave or food...
1	@brianwolven @theothervoices @drfunkyspoon Om eye!!!
1	@soledadobrien all the way downward dog.
1	@chrschwaegerl If they’re watching  they know. We’re not exactly subtle...
1	@HopeJahren @PlanetDr I like “habited” !
1	@tanyaofmars Congrats!!!!
1	@milkysa Yay!!!!
1	@numinouscosmos lovely!
1	@SANEAlex_ quite possible  but depending on atmospheric properties a lot of heat can be redistributed by weather...
1	@rboyle31 @TheAtlantic @TrueSciPhi That’s likely true. Unless rogue planets are exoplanets? Even then would have to be lucky!
1	@GerardoBarbosa see my last tweet...
1	@agilecoach @PlanetDr maybe even probable in a billion years...
1	@AdamFrank4 what a cool thought!
1	@brianwolven @ziyatong https://t.co/HMKmrjZnJp
1	@Wikisteff @erleellis @NatureComms yes  we will. The anthropocene concept will help us turn the corner.
1	@cosmos4u @astrokiwi @coreyspowell @ClimateOfGavin that's ok we'll all tweet details before then!
1	@astrokiwi @lacalaca85 @ClimateOfGavin I’m just glad I live on a planet in the *coffee* zone!!!
1	@astrokiwi @lacalaca85 yes  I saw one of those - got me out of bed!!
1	@sarahcottentail @StarkeyStardust @emilylurice right back atcha Sarah - thanks for making it happen!!
1	@Richardhurst19 he is a respected colleague. Have not collaborated but have known him for decades!
1	@Richardhurst19 cool!
1	@Richardhurst19 Thank YOU!!
1	@Richardhurst19 yes!! https://t.co/M9JVgdz6AO
1	@brianwolven good point!
-1	@StarTalkRadio @sarahcottentail Warp factor 7 Captain Cotten!
1	@Paleophile @BeccaPeixotto @meanlouise @fishinnards yes!
1	@ChrisDudley85 @washingtonpost don’t ignore what Hansen actually says about this then. He presents this as a hypothetical not a prediction.
-1	@brianwolven @markgurwell @TheEarthStory @LokiVolcano yes &amp; fractionation in Io as water was depleted  differential mineral bonding of H &amp; D
1	@Paleophile @edyong209 Ya - me too! Lets get a posse for Oct 3.
1	@markgurwell @brianwolven @TheEarthStory @LokiVolcano May well expect *extreme* fractionation  so consider possibility of lots of HDS...
1	@nadiamdrake @OSIRISREx Sounds like my flight from Houston to Tucson last night!
1	@markgurwell @brianwolven @TheEarthStory @LokiVolcano would you be able to get HDS?
1	@TheEarthStory @brianwolven @LokiVolcano That would be a cool measurement. What is the H containing substance/phase? Is there H2S?
1	@TheEarthStory @brianwolven @LokiVolcano Possible  but if there was a “least likely world to retain water” award I would nominate Io!
1	@mattrussell_PhD @mcnees @sgruenwald in astronomy it's often about education  outreach and training
1	@nourtra00456201 @the_wrangler @sciam @ESAcleanspace Yes!
1	@morphizm @the_wrangler @sciam Hah - yes!
1	@planetjuneberry @sciam wow - thanks!
1	@DrMRFrancis pssshhaawww!
-1	@DrMRFrancis and vice versa
1	@ElevenPointTwo @batchelorshow Yes.
1	@Mad_Science_Guy @spacearcheology Run!!!
1	Heads up: Emergence of Life symposium at @librarycongress 9/15 w me  @nccomfort @carlzimmer @sophiaroosth &amp; others. https://t.co/O3z32Xl6qM
1	@brianwolven @PlanetDr @sondy @Alex_Parker @elakdawalla @asrivkin Supercritical Flying Acid Squirrels. Saw them open for the Ramones at CBGB
1	@AdamFrank4 @Revkin @neiltyson I agree. There is no "great silence".
1	@AdamFrank4 @Revkin @neiltyson Agree with your assessment. Chapter on this in my new book! Intelligent life = sustainable. Otherwise dumb.
-1	@Paleophile True &amp; the list of people I know who've been brutally fired &amp; the smartest most creative &amp; lovely people I know overlap a lot!
-1	@Paleophile yes  and very common in our supposedly enlightened institutions. Pisses me off! But here's to survival! https://t.co/sun7RQm9nh
-1	@Paleophile oh man so sorry you went through that. Museum culture  I've found is so often twisted &amp; disrespectful. Painful to learn this.
1	@mattkenworthy @MJIBrown @PeterDEdmonds @AstroKatie @EricMamajek yes that's what this is.
1	@DrMRFrancis @PlanetDr At least there its a dry heat...
1	@PlanetDr We are stuck in our little terraformed base in DC.
-1	@AstroKatie @PeterDEdmonds agree. Depends on circumstances though. Sometimes embargoes  done in obnoxious ways (esp when combined w hints)
-1	@RichardFPenn @spacearcheology the creatures there think much the same about us with our treacherous seasons and caustic oxygenated air...
1	@AstroKatie @PeterDEdmonds yes. But apparently well founded.
1	@rappolee possible planet possibly in the possibly habitable zone.
-1	@ElevenPointTwo no it's sloppy short hand.
1	@EthonRaptor @ChrisDudley85 @CColose @DrJillStein If you’re interested in being somewhat more up to date start with https://t.co/FbCzV5nE5x
1	@EthonRaptor @ChrisDudley85 @CColose @DrJillStein That’s 26 yrs out of date. More recent work by @AlanRobock  others confirms nuclear winter
1	@ChrisDudley85 @EthonRaptor @CColose @DrJillStein Yes some details debated but for most part has held up. Toon's recent review in Phys Today
1	@ChrisDudley85 @EthonRaptor @CColose @DrJillStein Ha! Mars Ball. Yup.
1	@ChrisDudley85 @EthonRaptor @CColose @DrJillStein Good example of a very influential paper. I cover that history in depth in my new book.
-1	@ChrisDudley85 @EthonRaptor @DrJillStein @CColose But when we go beyond accepted science do we blunt the case for action? Consensus powerful
-1	@ChrisDudley85 @CColose @DrJillStein Extreme southern ice sheet collapse seems like a real risk over next 1000 to 5000 years.
1	@AsteroidEnergy @AndyKauffman yeah unless you could react methane with something already there like acetylene
-1	@ChrisDudley85 agree with most in principle  but needs a re-write. Strategic Defense Init was an awful Reagan-era project long abandoned.
1	@ChrisDudley85 @CColose @DrJillStein true. But 9 ft by 2050? Maybe she meant by 2500?
-1	@AndyKauffman @AsteroidEnergy possible  if you could find a way to burn it without O  or make O cheaply  or react ch4 w acetylene?
1	@lukedones @marykarrlit @NewYorker man that was good writing. Thanks for putting it out there. Sorry you have to deal w shit like that.
1	@AndyKauffman @AsteroidEnergy just might not be worth the energy to mine it to bring it elsewhere  as there are other sources.
1	@tanyaofmars cool!
1	@dbindsch @MarsMaven @radjanirad @LokiVolcano this is a great story. Have you written it up?
1	@gregzink @CassiniSaturn @neiltyson @ProfBrianCox absolutely! We were just scheming about that...
1	@hauck @PlanetDr @DrMRFrancis I mean g. G is probably not low there...
-1	@hauck @PlanetDr @DrMRFrancis I want to go rafting down one of these canyons. Is there turbulence? Imagine doing rapids in that low G.
1	@AndyKauffman @AsteroidEnergy maybe but that takes energy so depends where you want to use it. Don’t want more hydrocarbons on Earth!
-1	@AndyKauffman @AsteroidEnergy not really because there is no oxygen to burn it…
-1	@PlanetDr @DrMRFrancis yeah at least on a planet with all this damn oxygen. It’s a hazard!
1	@PlanetDr @DrMRFrancis Hey @jeffreyskargel are you on twitter?  Did you try something like this?
1	@DrMRFrancis @PlanetDr Somehow I think Jeff Kargel has tried this.
1	@DrMRFrancis There have been some experiments. Would be fun to try one…
1	@Mad_Science_Guy meant to include this link! https://t.co/cZweoWSvpC
1	@majormajor42 @Paladin1969 @CharlesCMann no
-1	.@Paladin1969 @CharlesCMann Yes  it's a dumb idea but point here is someone desperate could try it - so let's avoid that by limiting CO2.
1	“Planetary Intelligence: Managing Earth’s Future” interesting session at fall meeting of @theAGU  https://t.co/s4yrNy3Uod #anthropocene
-1	@Wildlebendes yes but no good hypothesis yet fits the data.
1	@Paleophile yes I think so!
-1	@Paleophile Oh crap - probably can’t today - got something at 3 til ?  But yeah we need this!
-1	@DrMRFrancis Yes. He also said “Life is a blur of Republicans and meat"
1	@DrMRFrancis Good idea!!
1	@DrMRFrancis OK!
1	@hauck @amytoast @astromarkmarley @EllenStofan @starstryder @StarzanPlanets honored to share such company!
-1	@numinouscosmos yeah I remember this. Freaky.
-1	@numinouscosmos yes we do :(
1	@lyndalovon impressive list of signatories.
1	@radjanirad great detail - thanks!
1	@lyndalovon whoops - correction. Just learned she was hired as first prof at Vassar https://t.co/bgEZn6TYRl

-1	@mousegle @yarotrof @wikileaks who knows how “poll” was conducted and spread? May not mean much but speaks poorly of those who responded...
1	@mousegle @yarotrof @wikileaks Egos attract?
-1	@AdamFrank4 no time to lose!
-1	@brianwolven @drfunkyspoon Yes I was a fan of wikileaks for a long time. But now they are manipulating and abusing their power.
1	@numinouscosmos some published abstracts and an unpublished paper that I have in draft form.
1	@numinouscosmos yeah and probably some literally hiding in my files &amp; boxes. I’m not mr. organized...
1	@numinouscosmos yes there is something sort of superhuman about it.
1	@numinouscosmos No I just found em yesterday. Maybe donate them one of these days.
1	@numinouscosmos He wrote that way. Dictating  in complete flawless sentences. I remember him on the beach writing Cosmos into a tape recorde
1	@tylerjmetivier thanks! New book coming out in December… (If I don’t spend all my time on Twitter…)
1	@tylerjmetivier Excellent source of inspiration! When I was a teen remember him walking on beach talking into tape recorder  writing Cosmos!
1	@heathermg Aaaaahhhhh!!!!!!
1	@numinouscosmos just posted a bunch more
1	@girlinalabcoat @NASAAmes Yeah me too. Had good times there and its always great to go back.
1	@numinouscosmos There’s a bunch more - I’ll post some tomorrow.
1	@numinouscosmos fun for me reading them too. Could have easily been chucked out as I’m tossing lots of files - glad I found these!
1	@girlinalabcoat @NASAAmes I was post-docking at Ames w Jim Pollack as my advisor. Pollack had been Sagan’s first student at Harvard.
1	@numinouscosmos Yes. and yes.
1	@Paleophile Just found the motherlode! Will tweet some… Throwing out nearly everything but these I will keep!
1	@ElevenPointTwo None in mine really either - but when I tweeted some anti Trump comments they came out of the woodwork to object...

1	@dsfpspacefl1ght @ProfAbelMendez @NewHorizons2015 a very different world. (&amp; we've had a decent look at a hemisphere &amp; glimpse at the rest)
1	@OmanReagan for me was external recognition- always wanted 2 b writer &amp; scientist but not til PhD &amp;  magazine pub thought of myself as those
1	@IanAdAstra @AlanStern This defnition values intrinsic properties over orbital location.Could be argued large asteroids &amp; moons ARE planets.
1	@IanAdAstra @AlanStern A reasonable criterion: if large enough to be round by self gravity (but too small to be a star) it is a planet.
1	@lyndalovon Thank you!
1	@numinouscosmos Thanks!
1	@foresthouse @AwesomeCon @DavaExplorer @BillNye @EugeneMirman @harikondabolu @kingfirestorm Nice. Thanks!
1	@omcintyre good words!!
1	@DrMRFrancis I’m game. Listening to it now. Great stuff!

1	@Babydok123 This is brilliant.
1	@DrMRFrancis Oh cool - wish I had discovered him earlier. What a treat it was to see him recently.
1	@DrMRFrancis https://t.co/XG4VwGiKHU  a great album.
1	@DrMRFrancis Saw him play recently  opening for Johnny Clegg. Really beautiful music.
1	@Astro_Zach &amp; those amazing shots of MSL entry from MRO.

1	@chriscwharris @sciencemuseum We focussed instead on building space instrumentation. My which we have been very successful :)
1	@thehighfrontier @sciencemuseum Thanks!
1	@MikeAlphaOne @sciencemuseum Expected orbit lifetime was 100 yrs I think. So  will be up there for a while yet :)

1	@mggtTaylor @AstroEmz Happy birthday Emily!
1	@FitzsimmonsAlan Hope you get a good view on your way in :)
1	@LiamTEdwards @standupmaths I am far more sensible :)
1	@jen_gupta Oh no! Hope you get another trip there!
1	@jen_gupta I caught it on my last day here!
1	@markmccaughrean Good luck deciding what to do!
1	@markmccaughrean I am a bit torn. There will probably be a solar physics meeting in Portland - I may drive in from there!
1	@helen_hm11 @UCL_Academy It has been great escapism - perfect for writing papers!
1	@suthers Glorious!

1	After an amazing morning it's time to get back to research using @NASASunEarth spacecraft to study the Sun's eruptions.
1	@markmccaughrean @honorharger Perhaps. But it encapsulates just how much it takes to make these missions happen.

-1	@helen_hm11 @asubsetofdaves @MihoJnvr @UKSolarPhysics Sorry not to be there!
-1	@susan_snowy It's very sad. It has gone horribly wrong.
1	@Rcotweet @spacelinklf @BroadwaterNews @astro_timpeake It was great to take part. Well done on organising another inspiring event!
1	@MihoJnvr Not sure… will let you know if I find out!
1	Photos from Friday's #TEDxlondon at the @sciencemuseum  https://t.co/lhXxt1DnrO
1	@chriscwharris @astro_timpeake What a beautiful cat!
1	@DawnSunrise1 @Leon_Helmink They are! I was late to realise this.
1	@Leon_Helmink @astrotweeps @EssBarraclough We always have am emergency supply :)
1	Now learning about superhydrophobic surfaces… good unless surface is contaminated with oil. @uclmaps research is developing a way to help!
1	Learning about organic semiconductor research &amp; solar cells at the @uclmaps PhD festival. Indigo dye used as it's a great absorber of light.
1	@MihoJnvr You got out just in time! Flooding delayed the next train 💧
1	Prepping for the Sky at Night session on Planet 9 at #cheltscifest. @FitzsimmonsAlan is on brand! https://t.co/cXrZJ1aNpl
1	@jckcrll @asubsetofdaves @MihoJnvr @JamieBGall @mattjaywhy I'll courier over the documentation :)
1	@asubsetofdaves Hello Dave! From your fan club :) @MihoJnvr @JamieBGall @mattjaywhy https://t.co/vfRn4euAFD
1	@susan_snowy Fair enough!!
1	@susan_snowy Sounds like a great way to spend the afternoon!
1	@einionyn @mggtTaylor Looks like some serious science is happening!
1	@MihoJnvr @cheltfestivals Thanks! And see you soon!
1	Great to meet astronaut Anna Fisher at the @worldscifest in New York. I think I look pretty pleased to see her! https://t.co/irKQ9Qb8c1
-1	@markmccaughrean @RonBaalke I need to look up details  but when plasma density &amp; speed high at earth -&gt; high pressure on mag. &amp; high impact!
1	@farrant_john @RonBaalke There's an MPEG format video here: https://t.co/yIElimW8Ep
1	@farrant_john @RonBaalke Was around 200 000 km high at time of photo and in the process of leaving the Sun.
1	@markmccaughrean @SpaceAmbassador Probably :)
1	@markmccaughrean Last time I was hear it was being used to soak up all the rain 💧
1	@scottkeir @asubsetofdaves When it comes to finding a link between a random object and the Sun  I have many ideas :) Enjoy the run &amp; 🍦
1	@diversionary @standupmaths If I chip in three more  you'll have enough for a calendar.
1	@asubsetofdaves I'll go for right-handed. But hard to say without intertwined emitting and absorbing threads 😀
1	I think @einionyn will appreciate this photo… https://t.co/pLETejhzYx
1	@AstroEmz @LeidenMarathon Amazing time! Congrats!
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks!

1	@seb_ly @standupmaths He does! Took me by surprise!
1	@PenguinGalaxy Thanks :) It was really fun to write!
1	@DavidBrockley One of today's speakers mentioned that the 1959 Soviet film the Sky Calls lands a rocket this way!
-1	@Capoglou No website sadly  but there will be a report. Focus is how to set policy that allows breakthrough innovation in space.
1	@EmiliaKilpua check out our new telescope operator! @erikapal is chasing the clouds away for the Mercury transit. https://t.co/wZoGHMtbWJ
-1	@sjb_astro @EpicCosmos @BBCStargazing @AstronomyNow You have clear skies! I am jealous :)
1	@whitenigel @Ri_Science Thanks for coming. And for winning the spot @standupmaths game :)
1	@e_astronomer Martin really should be on Twitter! It was a real treat to chat with him today.
1	@Roy_Astro @BBCRadio4 Thanks :) I don't delve much into aurora. But @m_windridge has a new book out on exactly that topic :)
1	@mrsdenyer That looks very familiar! It's a beautiful place :)
1	@MihoJnvr @MSSLSpaceLab :) see you tomorrow!
1	@jckcrll @asubsetofdaves @long_daithi @qsl_deb @slyardley I think that was me behind the lens. What a lovely evening it was!
1	@rjmlaird @idisruptspace you need to add two more for Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus :)
1	@mggtTaylor @ISSIBern I think we have opened a new comedy genre :)
1	@mggtTaylor @ISSIBern Stringy cheese to represent magnetic field lines... #EmmentalHD
1	@SamStreetr @standupmaths Thanks :) I hope you enjoy it!
1	@TomTomBigBum @sciencefocus Thanks for letting me know :)
1	@sciencefocus Thanks!
1	@helen_hm11 @space2earth Thanks Helen! It was a joy to put the stories together - old and new! But so many that I didn't have room to tell.
1	@stecks @sciencemuseum Thanks :) See you soon!
1	@TheRealMike @sciencemuseum Thanks and hope you enjoy the book!
1	@long_daithi @sciencemuseum Well  thank you for the awesome movies!

-1	@jen_gupta @AEOUD I'll be missing NAM again sadly. Have another meeting already booked in :(
1	It seems that no one does acronyms like astronomers do! Great stories by @jen_gupta at @AEOUD who recommends https://t.co/M2mP3KmkQs
1	@DawnSunrise1 @harryvcliff @sciencemuseum Thanks :)
1	@helen_hm11 @m_windridge @harryvcliff @sciencemuseum Thanks! Have a lovely week.
1	@m_windridge @harryvcliff @sciencemuseum Thanks!

1	@StellarPlanet @CatherineQ I am in the UK. Each eclipse is so exciting - wish I was able to see this one. Roll on August 21 2017!
1	@chrisenorth ☀️😀
1	@chrisenorth @FitzsimmonsAlan Flares don't have any impact on creation of aurora - it's the solar wind and CMEs that are important :)
-1	@chrisenorth Looks a fast solar wind steam did the trick!
1	@markmccaughrean Wow  have a great trip!
1	@markmccaughrean Tonight would be a good night to be on a flight!
1	@Katie_H_Joy @lewis_dartnell @Doctor_Astro I have never been so unexpectedly organised :)
1	@SkylarkBill @RogerHighfield There is a recent paper by Bernhard Kliem on it. Not sure if it is open access though.
1	If humans had the same composition as the Sun  what would we be made of? Great blog post by @asubsetofdaves https://t.co/5XoZeGBF7k
1	@Roy_Astro @DrJoVian @esa I'm not sure who runs that account. Will probably get more active as we approach launch (2018).
1	@asubsetofdaves @EssBarraclough @standupmaths Brilliant!
1	@khrizmo @standupmaths :)

1	Where would we be without smartphones? I'm on train after @BBCStargazing &amp; still able to follow @astro_timpeake as he preps for space walk.
1	@Smantha101 @BBCStargazing Not that we know of. Key thing would be if its mass significantly changed. But that doesn't look likely!
1	@geeves1987 @BBCStargazing Glad you like it!
1	@frankzrx @rjmlaird Somewhere that wasn't warm enough :) Actually  it was lovely when we did get a break in the clouds!
1	@themoonweaver @BBCStargazing Not sure why it says that… I'll have a look.
1	@helen_hm11 We had all the weather!
1	@sjb_astro @BBCStargazing Weather looks better tomorrow but sadly we won't be stargazing. It's all about Tim tomorrow!

1	@BIS_spaceflight Thank you!
1	@AstroAndyN @BIS_spaceflight Thank you! It was a lovely surprise!
1	My latest @SEN blog post - this week's opening of the UK space weather centre at the @metoffice http://t.co/0sMGouOyl4
1	Great article by my colleague @einionyn on how citizen scientists gave new life to an abandoned space probe http://t.co/lz9AAAWJCB
1	@Victrix75 @WorldSpaceWeek I think so! It's all public and they have new web pages too.
1	@AstroExeter @g7izu @g0lfp I know - I enjoyed it though :)
1	@MihoJnvr Thank you! It's been a good day :)
1	@mistuk @space_weather @metoffice Me too!

1	Lovely way to end the week - recording a podcast with @Spaceboffins and chatting about our wonderful poet-in-residence @EssBarraclough
1	@walkerpjames @asubsetofdaves I agree!
1	But to get this information from sunlight we need to create a spectrum and study the spectral lines @asubsetofdaves
1	So much information can be obtained from sunlight - plasma density  flows  temperature and  my favourite  magnetic field. @asubsetofdaves
1	Second day at the STFC summer school for PhD students. @asubsetofdaves is giving us a great talk about spectroscopy.
-1	@NWAstroFest @KnowledgeObsAst @chrisenorth I am away that weekend :(

1	Lovely to have @EssBarraclough at our space lab today. Now to @RoyalAstroSoc &amp; dinner with one of the UK's first female astronomy professors
1	@gregfoot It has been a great programme to work on - my hair acts like a hygroscope!
1	@RFlude @DawnSunrise1 I agree!!
1	@gbc123 Very nice! Beautiful scenery but no aurora sadly.
1	A lovely blog post looking at some of the the history of my space lab  by @uclmaps http://t.co/zqQqJuiwZP

1	@MCockerham I had my first publication in that journal in 2001 :)
1	@GrahamBowes I am :) Wonderful views of the aurora!
1	@Victrix75 Thanks!
1	Arrived at the @sciencemuseum for an all-female line-up to discuss life as a solar physicist - part of an ebook launch.
1	@dallascampbell @KarenLMasters @jodrellbank Solar eruptions I can do  aurora in the UK is harder :)
1	@dallascampbell @KarenLMasters @jodrellbank Unlikely that we will get aurora in the UK tonight. The solar eruption has passed over us now.

1	Off to meet 650 of the world's brightest young minds (and 65 fellow laureates) at 65th @lindaunobel meeting-  I do have a good job!
1	@cosmos4u Of course acceleration founded on far more than just SN Ia at this point  so fundamental result is not going away
1	@StephenSerjeant @cosmos4u IMHO stat analysis is at best un-orthodox  &amp; for a reasonable prior on ΩM  their analysis still p&gt;99.9% q0&lt;0
-1	@SciBry @DrMRFrancis @AstroKatie Unwise to say offensive comments about women in science  it is.

-1	@robertcnichol @UoS_SNe Portsmouth bad part of town! I am here for all of next week!
1	@GoneAsync @abcnews so what do you see as a better training path?
-1	@ProfMike_M @SciBry @AstroKatie Very challenging to factor these things out and use h-index - therefore  I find it almost useless now
1	@SciBry @ProfMike_M @AstroKatie I try to ignore h-indices  - how to compare someone who is on  e.g.  SDSS  with someone who works alone
1	The @Science_Academy + @UNSW Les Field's discussion of the budget from a science point of view https://t.co/nFTMdAy4Gv
1	@RFSEngineer I don't condone disrespect to anyone. However  its not my side  I have not joined a team  other than the @Science_Academy
1	@jegpeek @SkyMapper ping me via email - probably not ready yet  but give us a few months
1	@BlackPhysicists yes  I will be interested to see the details
1	@GarthGodsman yes - I felt a bit ill when I realized it ... Glad it was the Oz passport I forgot - if it was the US  then game over
1	@chapmansar @KarenAndrewsMP @tanyamonro It is important to make sure teachers are included in the solutions!
1	@chapmansar @KarenAndrewsMP @tanyamonro There is on this body on which I serve http://t.co/u9AeUZpJ29
1	@BlackPhysicists I feel confident they are not going to resend the Accelerating Universe anytime soon
1	@betock20 Hopefully they will find new particles at the higher energies that help us understand Dark Matter or Unification of the 4 forces
-1	@ABCNews Your headline completely misses the point of the Snowden interview  http://t.co/hbK3Dcz1r0
-1	@Wikisteff @BadPhysics @AstroKatie We see Universe decelerating before its current acceleration. Dark Energy could be a relic from inflation

1	@BlackPhysicists Issue is that SKAHQ in Manchester came with £119M contribution https://t.co/set2a2oxcd
1	@BlackPhysicists Some Day. A small chance I'll make the 25th anniversary of Hubble.
1	@GarthGodsman @telescoper you were right even if I was too
1	@vpettorino @lindaunobel yes it should be 1998 and it should also mention that we were just members of large teams
-1	@sciorama @e_astronomer Oh I've been introduced - that is precisely the problem!
1	@PaulDroop I strongly support the @Science_Academy report of experts &amp; argue it is the best information we have (right or wrong).
-1	Solving crime with fly poo is just the beginning! - Upcoming events @Science_Academy https://t.co/cy0BWAy4G4
1	@MjrElvisNewton So let's get back to square 1. Why should we listen to you and not the @Science_Academy
-1	@tan123 If underlying facility is emitting lots CO2 associated with that steam  then not clear misleading. If it is something else  then yes
1	@tan123 I agree that what we see is almost certainly steam  presumably marking an associated mixture of CO2  aerosols (1/2)
1	. @MjrElvisNewton And if not the @Science_Academy speaking on Climate Science  Who? You?
1	@tan123 not my choice - but is it labelled as cO2?
1	I want to correct one thing on @RadioNational interview - I am not an author or reviewer of @Science_Academy climate science report -

-1	@MJIBrown help your friends  shame your enemies? Generally think it is good to attack the ideas  not the person. Although my Newman bet ...

1	@ebpetroff @SciBry @Cosmic_Horizons @peterdedmonds @JacquelynGill You do not need to stand up  just get another one (it sends a message!)
1	@SciBry @Cosmic_Horizons @peterdedmonds @JacquelynGill @ebpetroff If this your experience  get a new supervisor!

1	@cwmagee @astropixie @AstroKatie Thanks - you obviously adopt a negative sign convention for W.
-1	@AstroKatie @Dr_Mel_Thomson @upulie Sorry guys - most invites went to DVC-Rs of Universities  CEOs of Medical Research Institutes etc
1	Congrats to @naomimcgriff @Science_Academy Pawsey Medal for 2015 http://t.co/h5bnLyLFhy - we welcome Naomi to Stromlo next year as Professor
-1	@cwmagee yes you do and demand comes from many sources -for Oz plenty of demand - being cost effective - that is the challenge
-1	@AusAndgie7 I would argue there is not a particularly strategic govt vision at present. Very difficult to plan around what is out there.
1	@AusAndgie7 @astroduff @AstroKatie @Mighty_Ginge Yes  I agree
1	@AusAndgie7 @astroduff  RoI is almost by def impossible to judge in advance - key is to use capability we have to maximum advantage
1	@telescoper @e_astronomer obviously not a chemistry or an Astronomy class!

-1	@BlackPhysicists my 48th Birthday - alas I will be in Australia -  Brian
1	@BenneHolwerda congrats on your work...
1	@BenneHolwerda some sort of baseline is required - that is the main point - Nuclear is one option - but not the only one...
1	@Aus_ScienceWeek been there ( well  Fargo) done that!
1	@astropixie Hopefully your comrades at the @AAOastro will come over and put it into the microwave for you.
1	@BlackPhysicists Alas - I am in Australia at an @The_AWRI board meeting and celebrating my birthday

-1	Memorizing space oddity lyrics in prep of tomorrow evening's event with @Cmdr_Hadfield @AstroKatie organized by @ANU_Events &amp; @ScienceAlert
1	@astropixie @dougdela @AAOastro The reason- exponential expansion (from  Λ) leads to unchanging H0  which I think is around ~58 km/s/Mpc
1	@astropixie @dougdela @AAOastro H0 = in km/s/Mpc - don't think it ever gets there actually
1	@RobertMMassey @R_Trotta @ProfMike_M @davecl42 @AstroKatie The analysis here is a longitudinal study by NSF and is as good as it can be.
-1	@Harcel @ProfMike_M @R_Trotta @davecl42 and it is USA. Only place that has the data I am afraid that I can find.
1	@Harcel @ProfMike_M @R_Trotta @davecl42 These figures withing 1st year out of PhD - for those with confirmed jobs
1	@ProfMike_M @R_Trotta @AstroKatie @davecl42 interesting jobs in and out of academia. But money does not = happiness

1	Great Australian Wine for Nobel Prize Winners @lindaunobel including @Clonakilla 13 O'Riada  and @yalumba Viognier and Chardonnay (&amp; my own)
1	The things I do for science... like ensuring we drink good wine @lindaunobel meeting. http://t.co/AWjDbHPcHl
1	@gravitate_to_me It is as subtle as it name and at $400 bottle I might consider keeping it for a special occasion
1	@Science_Academy similar to @The_AWRI yeast 2.0 with Macquarie &amp;international partners. Knowledge is always key to do better   in wine too
1	@astronomolly @astronomeara there is always a 2014 to be drunk at tenure - better come and give another colloquium in a few years
1	@agora101 @realscientists i.e. we need a designated driver
1	@MJIBrown more money  probably more adminstrators - but not a foregone conclusion - competition might help a bit - hard to know
1	@JustJimWillDo @realscientists Your coordinates seem to indicate Bacchus Marsh - conveniently close to Geelong (go Cats?) and Dr_Mel_Thomson
-1	@JustJimWillDo @realscientists I'm assuming that is an insult. ANU hasn't supplied a designer yet. But the 360 degree trip through my life?
1	@realscientists @smiffy @ScientistMags We definitely need to talk. I'm thinking intervention next time I'm in Geelong (my uncle lives there)
1	@realscientists @smiffy @ScientistMags when we next meet- maybe we should do course 1) in wine etiquette...
1	@realscientists @smiffy @ScientistMags good on 'em - But whites over Pinot Noir - oh I am tweetless
1	@realscientists geeze thanks! I need to send you a case (except I am sold out!) You are not on my wine list  are you?
-1	@realscientists @jonoabroad Like Australia  it isn't all bad. But the gradient is in the wrong direction in the US right now.
-1	.@realscientists @CSIRO_ATNF cuts seem big and I fear may undermine their ability to run and develop our nation's radio telescopes + SKA
1	@realscientists @jonoabroad USA and Australia

1	Lisa Kewley giving her @Science_Academy address in the Shine Dome http://t.co/gDP5FOnZiQ
1	@phdardel @openscience ultimately the editor of the journal decides what is published or not -ArXiV only moderates out the most flakey pubs
1	@astronomolly @astronomeara We are even out for the colloquium speakers right now! But the Stromlo Colloquium is a place to get a bottle!
1	@weezmgk otherwise  a reflection of the sun off something  near you might give a rainbow offset from normal positions.
1	@weezmgk I suspect that R2 is the brightest (and is 42deg)  R1 is much fainter and is 52 deg  and R3 is the 'glory' &amp; centreed around shadow
1	@weezmgk so 1 straight ahead (sounds like glory)  the 45 above and 45 below are the same rainbow ( just the top &amp; the bottom of the circle)
1	@weezmgk angles do not depend on proximity of clouds-you can draw a picture with pen  &amp; use your phone or computer to take a photo and post!
1	@weezmgk I don't understand the geometry based on description-rainbow is at 42deg opp sun   2nd ~52deg  where is your 3rd rainbow?
1	@weezmgk Other effect is known as a 'Glory' that you see directly opposite the rainbow - or from airplanes http://t.co/2ci4Knhswt
1	@weezmgk so top and bottom bow are probably same bow. Rainbows are circles if you - see image http://t.co/td7FVIyEkS
1	@weezmgk Perhaps draw me a diagram  and post it - Something unusual is required  because it cannot be formed like a normal rainbow
1	@weezmgk @DoctorKarl @PantheraUncia76 unsure - was 3rd bow concentric with other 2  was it inside our outside two bright ones?
1	@apfergus @AstroKatie @peterdedmonds You got my reference! I was born in 1967! so this is my birth year.
1	@peterdedmonds @AstroKatie   ρ  and ρcrit are close when one makes spheres between us and Virgo  more important than w (EOS) I think
-1	@peterdedmonds @AstroKatie Tough call on exactly where the edge of forever is
1	@robertcnichol  An iicrash - not to be confused with a icrash (where you need to reset your phone)
-1	@RiAus Guilty as charged.
1	@snnsx @GhostOfPJK @realscientists Important to remember this applies to working Nuclear Power plant (not Chernobyl and Fukashima!)
1	@GhostOfPJK @realscientists This fact sheet has most info you might want http://t.co/M3nmZtvioj
-1	@GhostOfPJK @realscientists @sciam headline is misleading. Should say  more radioactivity living next to Coal compared to working Nuclear
1	@GhostOfPJK @realscientists Agreed - concentration will depend on source of coal - general overview @sciam http://t.co/4QfPv1iUHg
-1	@realscientists @GhostOfPJK The coal burning doesn't change radioactivity  so whatever is released is what was in coal to begin with
1	@RickHM He seems to be calling for it  @Science_Academy is ready (and eager!)

1	@Leaving_Orbit @Cosmic_Carol I apologise  I thought you were  and thank you for the correction (you're still outstanding in my eyes)
-1	@Cosmic_Carol Jon Amos  Pallab  David (and Rebecca) are all at the top of their game. The appalling way dealt with  was not on
1	@Cosmic_Carol It was like "oh you're just a journalist  why are you asking me this?" Well I'm from the best news team on the planet and ...
-1	@Leaving_Orbit @Cosmic_Carol Truly appalling "I don't understand the question" almost made me choke on my coffee.BBCsci are world class team
1	@Cosmic_Carol spot on... you took the words out of my mouth
-1	@Cosmic_Carol Deal with the facts and be honest. No spin  no BS  no grey suit mentality... be clear  concise and go with your heart
-1	@Cosmic_Carol JW's response to Pallab et al this morning  didn't go down well... it smacked of bad PR. Needed more of the FD's honesty
1	@Cosmic_Carol Yup  it needs a solid press release to come out from the FD...as soon as any analysis is in of course
-1	@Cosmic_Carol The issue is also that the press conference was not great. I agree though  this headline is silly
1	@kennicosmith Be strong...and take great memories forward
-1	@forthelaunch Fears for 2020 for sure

-1	@AwesomeAstroPod @AstroDSLR Biggest concern is for 2020 mission..
-1	@AwesomeAstroPod @AstroDSLR I spoke to Colin not long after at a Mars event in Wroughton and he was broken by the sheer vitriol
1	@esaoperations @AwesomeAstroPod @NASAJPL next time  maybe they could send Adam Steltzner too?
1	@AwesomeAstroPod @AstroDSLR bingo!
1	@forthelaunch @Victrix75 @esaoperations always pays to wait ;-)
1	@AstroDSLR @BBCPallab @BBCAmos @SkyNews Sky News is run by Rupert Murdoch.. and have people like Kelvin on as commentators... enough said!
1	@Astro_Adept very true  been saying that all morning... it's just the superstition stats (Apollo 13  cosmosnauts urinating on sheels etc)
1	@Cosmic_Carol I hope someone asks this question at the PC though... it needs to be asked... as it's on everyone's minds
1	@Cosmic_Carol aye  I have one in brew too
-1	@Cosmic_Carol It's non scientific so it bothers me  but ...yes  there is a lot of existing superstition in space industry
1	@Cosmic_Carol no  we can't   but superstition plays a part (cosmosnauts weeing  no 13's in any mission etc etc)
1	@Cosmic_Carol need ground truth mission now  and I'd be basically bricking it if I were launching my big rover on a Russian launcher..
1	@Cosmic_Carol I suspect the calm before the wake for lander :-(... TGO will be amazing though
-1	@cosmos4u spent time with Colin at the science museum...so sad
1	@cosmos4u true..for the cost of a premiership football player ..only so much can be done
1	@mggtTaylor @timmermansr needs you in a Hawaiian
1	@timmermansr @cosmos4u isn't ..dang phone
-1	@timmermansr @cosmos4u fat lady as it singing yet .. but .. yes
1	@cosmos4u @timmermansr too busy making fluffy toys ;)
1	@Samcornwell @mggtTaylor @janwoerner in orbit only at this time... fingers crossed!
-1	@cosmos4u I know :-(
1	@pilliarscreatio @Cosmic_Carol ditto... this HAS to work for so many reasons
1	@Cosmic_Carol @pilliarscreation Exactly  we're all waiting in hope
1	@DawnSunrise1 you're obviously not watching the live stream... it's like watching a wake
1	@AstroExeter @hastroparr anysmal... like watching paint dry... thankfully the scientists are brilliant and the work brilliant
1	@hastroparr @AstroExeter expected LOS I hasten to add
1	@hastroparr @AstroExeter LOS still at the moment...
-1	@hastroparr @AstroExeter I have a bunch of very bored looking people in a control room with "loss of signal from highgain" antenna latest
-1	@hastroparr @AstroExeter https://t.co/SJ7O3uWJxu works... buzzing!... #irony
1	@hastroparr @AstroExeter nope... me either...
1	@AstroExeter @hastroparr please wait for broadcast to begin... erm?
-1	@LauraForczyk no doubt physics is the same  just we have nothing on any scale that could even come close
1	@LauraForczyk Comet - 12 months.. nothing larger than a bus outside of LEO since 1972... we have 0% chance of saving anything right now
1	@ScienceChannel Moon would be a good start...
-1	@Cosmic_Carol 40 minutes long  seriously one of the dullest things ever...
1	@Cosmic_Carol Having seen some of the other videos  it's par for the course. I remember in Ghenk everyone literally fell asleep to one !
1	@Cosmic_Carol @ESA_EDM gone for accuracy with no sound then! ;-)
-1	@QuarkTees @spaceflashnews oh god no! not more of this crap
1	@LauraForczyk @TheMarsSociety Comets bigger problem...35km wide at 25 000mph...good luck redirecting anything with 12mth notice!
1	@AwesomeAstroPod Rosetta... just wow... FD team IMHO deserve some award akin to the Nobel Prize for pure brilliance
1	@AwesomeAstroPod @Philae2014 no  it was outstanding given it Tiggered its way across the comet
1	@markmccaughrean @BBCAmos Good luck on this one... very important!
1	@pilliarscreatio Cymru am byth my friend
-1	@pilliarscreatio the news and a program about to air about the events of that tragic day..
1	@freestarcharts about 6.3
1	@Cosmic_Carol @thehighfrontier worked in the music industry don't forget... lots of visits to AES show
-1	@Cosmic_Carol @thehighfrontier Not the only thing ridiculous in that neck of the woods... used to visit quite a lot
-1	@Cosmic_Carol @thehighfrontier if you say it fast enough  the name of the airport sounds about right... #shithole
1	My article with @WordenAlfred in @spaceanswers magazine this month!.. it's HUGE!! https://t.co/JBP34rtMHq
1	@geoffnotkin John says hi come back soon https://t.co/X7Prv7coMD
1	@geoffnotkin will do
1	@TheSpaceGal @OneDublin nice!!!
1	@pilliarscreatio @hellospacething utterly brilliant
-1	@hannahdev @jeff_foust they'd live  rough... but they'd live  that's what counts
-1	@starlingLX Only O'Keefe should ever be blamed for anything bad on Hubble... no astronaut ever failed that scope.. he did!
1	@NASAWatch @blueorigin @virgingalactic simple ...follow both and hope both are a huge success/open up space travel for many more
1	@markmccaughrean That was in 2009  even my Irish friends warned me to "get dropped at the obsy doors...nowhere else"
-1	@markmccaughrean Mine tried to drop me off on "that lane"... it was like a scene from "Escape from New York".. I refused to get out
1	@markmccaughrean https://t.co/gPAeEk04tQ  The observatory is lovely though... just don't mention the moon rock ;-)
-1	@markmccaughrean https://t.co/w0075fIZFz even taxi drivers don't like to go near there!
1	@markmccaughrean take a flak jacket!
1	Looks like an outstanding event again for @WordenAlfred at Alton Towers with @Victrix75 for @WSW_UK
1	@thehighfrontier @Cosmic_Carol @pilliarscreatio @hastroparr That's small fry test...  reality is very different
1	@pilliarscreatio @Cosmic_Carol @hastroparr yup = 12-13 months ish
1	@hastroparr @Cosmic_Carol have a look at the online impact calculator... stick in 35km wide   made of rock/ice 45degree angle at 25 000mph
1	@pilliarscreatio @Cosmic_Carol @Spacefest They are sci fi... for larger bodies... okay with smaller at great distance  but ..
1	@Cosmic_Carol @hastroparr Done SOOO much on this topic. having found quite a few asteroids and helped confirm a LOT of comets
-1	@Cosmic_Carol @hastroparr 35km wide moving at 80 000mph... hard as steel... nope   we're dead
1	@AstroExeter @Cosmic_Carol @hastroparr Very much. Hale Bopp was 1 month away from a potentially much closer brush! C2013A1 &amp; Mars !
1	@AstroExeter @hastroparr @Cosmic_Carol Comes from comets full stop.. new ones  you get 13 months notice.. Hale Bopp = 35km wide = screwed!
1	@Cosmic_Carol decades
-1	@Cosmic_Carol only works at large distances and useless for comets
1	@Cosmic_Carol love to know how they plan to deflect em
1	@Markthemallet @hastroparr @ADavies915 no  it genuinely looks like someone is having a very poor taste laugh with that soft toy!
1	Annnd @BBCStargazing the most inappropriate gif images of a fluffy toy in history award goes to!
1	@Victrix75 you are  and my girls absolutely love you... thank you for everything...
1	The awesome @WordenAlfred is next appearing at Alton Towers to kick off UK's involvement in @WSW_UK . Event organised by #epic @Victrix75
1	Just on @LBC talking Rosetta with a huge H/T to FD team  science teams @mggtTaylor Rita Schulz and many more
1	@DrPioneer18 I know  I helped organise Spacefest in June and many said it was there last event
1	@ESA_History gracias amigo!
1	@BBCBreakfast @mggtTaylor Brilliant words... #STEM outreach motivation... nice one!
1	@MonicaGrady  Like a wake.... disturbingly so
1	@Ian_Benecken @twinklespinalot @esa @NASA yeah right!
1	@Astroguyz give it 6 months for the embargo to be lifted ... lol ;-)
1	@markmccaughrean @bbc5live as ever Mark  outstanding
1	@michealjroberts @vrooje @DrJoVian UG's have bigger issues with #Brexit et al right now and the opportunities for work/placements etc
1	@timmermansr @BillNye @IAC2016 @exploreplanets tell the Osiris team ;-)
-1	@michealjroberts example with Al Worden this weekend  talking Apollo 15 to 300 kids for free in theatre in most deprived area of UK
1	@michealjroberts Ppl know my track record  and there are more like me who do this to engage as many ppl as poss in science
1	@michealjroberts Not at all  just wanting to know HOW people outside of the academic halls can help academics more with outreach
1	@michealjroberts @DrJoVian (2/2) is just one recent example. Working with academics on support material for the moon rocks
1	@michealjroberts @DrJoVian Money is one aspect  funding can be found for projects and self will drives a lot too. STFC Lunar project example
1	@DrJoVian @michealjroberts Interesting reading this and wanting to help academia do more/support more outreach
1	@NoniSturge @esa back up ... gracias  merci and danke
1	@Mistresspixel @CraftLass @Woodtoast @Reuters phew !! :-) happy days
1	@AstroExeter how many space agencies does it take to stream a conference ;-) #canorbitacomet #cantstreamapressconf
1	@Woodtoast @CraftLass @Mistresspixel @Reuters good to hear
1	@CraftLass @Woodtoast @Mistresspixel Tell me you're all okay? https://t.co/UsVHFu1cIF
-1	@datachick @AstroKatie @guardian Sad but probably true Karen. I knew Rita  that's what made it touch home a lot more
1	@cldm_ish Much like a few others I know like @carolynporco #Bea Mueller and more.. great to know!
1	@DavidBflower sounds about right
1	@Blackprojects Jakub Cerny posted all the orbital data updates on multiple FB comet pages..
1	@RosettaMIDAS @markmccaughrean Great work!...
1	@DavidBflower @AstroExeter The wonderful thing about Tiggers.... ;-)
1	@pilliarscreatio know it well  great book  great story
1	Wasn't that just on display at @newscilive with smoke coming out of the top? ;-) https://t.co/x7pB1HlqsZ
1	@FakeAstropix I know  who knew that my home county is actually Hadley Rille
1	@pilliarscreatio https://t.co/PeHCBnUo2C
-1	@pilliarscreatio It is a Federal offence to own or sell any Apollo moon rocks. The only exceptions are the Govt gifted ones (goodwill)
1	@FakeAstropix I'm on a mission on meteorites at the mo... ;-) https://t.co/Qjes5SIKZK
-1	@FakeAstropix 10 mins in Photoshop and someone with the IQ of a sloth could knock that up.. sad isn't it?
1	@DrPioneer18 Yes  I know it well  it was taken the day I was born..
1	@martyschaer @markmcan @JeffBezos https://t.co/juueLJ2hRD good overview if you want the quick version
1	@martyschaer @markmcan @JeffBezos It blew up on all of them!
1	Funniest description ever of Comet 67P at @newscilive from the Pulsar stand... it's unprintable  but so amusing and accurate
1	@Astro_Adept @newscilive @MeteoritesAZ @BIS_spaceflight joy to meet you
1	@Victrix75 @BIS_spaceflight @Dr_Lucie @standupmaths @WordenAlfred @newscilive fab
1	Staggeringly successful @newscilive event for @MeteoritesAZ Europe ..and huge thanks to #spacecollective &amp; @BIS_spaceflight for everything
1	Only a very limited no.of Seymchan pallasite left on our stand at @newscilive .. and ONE moon rock #NSLive
1	Thank you all who made our first day @newscilive so amazing for @MeteoritesAZ ... Sunday will be fab too..
1	We have a limited number of the stunning #seymchan pallasite on our stand @newscilive https://t.co/mQBlPLOBg7
1	Delighted to say we now take all major card payments and contactless at @MeteoritesAZ  Europe .. see us at @newscilive this weekend
1	We have museum grade meteorites on our stand at @newscilive ..come and say hi this weekend
1	Drop by our stand next to S4 entrance for fantastic meteorites @newscilive https://t.co/bPK54O1OgI
1	Sat in the hotel with the El Tiro meteorite .. going to be the star piece tomorrow with piece of the moon @newscilive on our stand nr @esa
1	@SpaceMascotUK @contactlight69 @WordenAlfred @daraobriain @Victrix75 great pic
1	@goonhillyorg @spacegovuk @AmsatUK @Melcd @cornishengineer @invest_cornwall applied last year .. never again
-1	@Blackprojects @Spacefest I spent time with Peter  his son at SF.. Never met Pete C himself though  he sadly passed a bit before my "time"
1	@Blackprojects @Spacefest A bit  apart from this one landed with Pete Conrad on the Moon in Nov 1969
1	@Blackprojects @Spacefest Had no monetary value to me  just wonderment at wearing something which w/on Moon  the day I was born!
1	@Astro_Adept yes and yes
1	@Victrix75 @WordenAlfred @BIS_spaceflight the free tickets we were offering... but it's all in hand..
1	@Astro_Adept @4tuneQkie @MeteoritesAZ we will have from new batch
1	@Victrix75 @WordenAlfred @BIS_spaceflight free tickets
-1	@Victrix75 @WordenAlfred @BIS_spaceflight sadly too late to ship em now :-(
-1	@PenguinGalaxy crying laughing at some of them... utter utter moron..
1	@markmccaughrean way too many syllables for most of his voters ...
1	@JayneMcCubbinTV @kielder_obs @BBCBreakfast Supplied by me to @kielder_obs
1	@sjb_astro @AwesomeAstroPod enjoy tonight ;-)
1	Heads up to all #meteorite fans. @MeteoritesAZ Europe will be at @newscilive with some amazing bargains on space rocks. See you there
1	@David_Scanlan @meteorbill @MeteoriteMen @SOTTnet wooiah
1	@AwesomeAstroPod Back up now  share the holy moly out of this link https://t.co/btJ8FZhQGF
1	@markmccaughrean @_Merlyn spot on!...
1	@DavidGalvin9 @AlDarkSkyWales cost of two large lattes and sandwiches at Starbucks
1	That's some endorsement  thank you @AwesomeAstroPod https://t.co/Upb5Hm0Ib9
1	@DavidGalvin9 sending out tickets Monday :)
1	@DavidGalvin9 looking after my friends makes me so happy
1	@DavidGalvin9 :)
1	@Cosmic_Carol @MeteoritesAZ well one of them will have more than one astronaut  but one will be at both
1	@Cosmic_Carol @pilliarscreatio and England... more then one in England too!
1	@pilliarscreatio yes mate  an Apollo astronaut in Wales... Cymru am Byth
1	@Cosmic_Carol Just waiting on the booking form to go live  site admins working like mad..
1	@cosmos4u @NASA close enough for Jazz..
1	@scienceogram @DavidBflower Gotta love a Tory Govt  they really know how to destroy science
1	@Cosmic_Carol @Spacefest June  second week  and yes
1	@WelshMagician @geoffnotkin @MeteoriteMen Told you it was a beauty!
1	@WelshMagician @geoffnotkin @MeteoriteMen absolutely chuffed for you bruv
1	@Astroguyz @Philae2014 @Nancy_A @universetoday They first spotted it over a year ago
1	@Space_Lectures @airandspace @LastManOnMoon Amazing isn't it? Had the honour of holding Apollo samples these past few months
-1	@pilliarscreatio 15-17 were J (sorry I went to bed)
1	@hellospacething @DavidGalvin9 @MeteoritesAZ @geoffnotkin Wow... just ...wow
1	@markmccaughrean @WelshMagician @geoffnotkin Be interested to see what this pans out as
1	@Samcornwell @apod today's pic
1	So it seems like @apod is now about as credible as a Kim Jong Un space mission..
1	@lauriecantillo @NewHorizons2015 @NASA more then one in that field
-1	@markmccaughrean @guardian there's many things the govt could stop but don't ..ivory just one sickening example
1	@markmccaughrean @guardian about as hard as it is to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia?
1	@AstroExeter The girls love it  they've been having pool parties with their friends this week..
1	@AstroExeter awesome fun!! solar heater is next thing for sure
1	@geoffnotkin right back at ya #FF #Feveryday
1	@spaceanswers outstanding book
1	This came from @hastroparr it's just pure genius https://t.co/qiPWqjx6xj
1	@NatureNews good tweet  unlike your other ones relating to this story which are shoddy clickbait for what is a good video
1	@markmccaughrean @AstroKatie @AllPlanets @exploreplanets First decent reporting I have seen on this whole story
-1	@Exotides @cosmos4u @DavidBflower @Leaving_Orbit @ESO 30 000 miles a second  presents a bit of a challenge for that ;-)
1	@cosmos4u @DavidBflower @Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @ESO big leap from 45 000 mph to 30 000 miles a second ;-)
1	@RainerKresken @Leaving_Orbit at 30 000 miles per second.. that'll make Juno's recent endeavours look like a Trabant with a dodgy engine
-1	@Leaving_Orbit @RainerKresken our lander about the size proposed by Hawking et al.. so ..very tricky
-1	@Leaving_Orbit @RainerKresken oh no  working on a Mars methane lander with a team in Oz myself so we know the challenge just to orbit
1	@cosmos4u @ESO ha ha ha.... I'll get my Borg implant ready then
1	@cosmos4u @ESO I love the ironic wink Dan... speaks volumes ;-) And ... flyby at 30 000 miles/second.. yeah... good luck!
1	@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides "Holy Crap on a Cracker" has to be my favourite line so far...
1	@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit given we;ve ventured a grand total of 450 miles in the last 44 years from our planet  I'm not holding my breath
1	@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit But then you have supposed quality science press stating this! https://t.co/DfvSG0Diy3
1	@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @jaynebirkby This does seem to imply it's transiting hopeful angular res would allow more - https://t.co/XD4oNuhqDh
1	@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @jaynebirkby Also holding hope that SKA when fully online could be a powerful tool in this area of research
1	@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @jaynebirkby If I am wrong  then thanks for pointing that out
1	@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @jaynebirkby surely angular resolution good enough.. and spectra could be obtained on JWST?
1	@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit Some examples   from the good old British gutter press https://t.co/C6f6iA8AOs
1	@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit @jaynebirkby JWST would be the other option.  I have a vested interest in that
1	@Exotides @Leaving_Orbit Seriously  outstanding work on your part (and any of your team). Shoddy journalism is major issue again here
1	@Leaving_Orbit @RainerKresken @Exotides Nice... one maybe for the 2m scopes at Siding to follow up on
1	@RainerKresken @Leaving_Orbit @Exotides That's one thread I have read. I'd like to know if that's the true case
-1	@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides "Earth like  possibly with life..." and that's just reputable media... I dread to think what FOX/CNN are spouting
-1	@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides I am in no way dismissing the outstanding work done here  I am dismissing the flagrant BS in the media though
-1	@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides and it's non transiting  so a tad tricky to get much more right now it seems
1	@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides My FB post two hours ago was... ;-) Twitter has limits
-1	@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides bigger problem is "Then what"... 11600 years to get there.. w fastest flyby ever (100 w Hawking plan)
1	@Leaving_Orbit @Exotides I read her work  it's very good..but we don't even know if it has an atmosphere yet
1	@WelshMagician @geoffnotkin @MeteoriteMen @MeteoritesAZ @MHUnlimited Thank you  it's been an awesome first year... many more to come
1	@Astro_Nicole I can't wait to promote this at @blueshiftirl with you... see you soon! https://t.co/LSTz55WSUI
1	This one for the @DailyMailUK @BBCRadio2 Jeremy Vine and that chap in Leeds - https://t.co/wHpNGDicmw #meteorites
1	At @BlueshiftIRL in October we'll have @NASA_Hubble #Apollo @NASAGoddard @ESA @LunarMissionOne @MeteoriteMen and #APOLLO astronaut/FC's
1	@geoffnotkin That is a stunner!
1	@genejm29 about 70 years time perhaps given our current rate of "exploration"
1	@BBCRadio2 I did t hear one expert on that show
-1	@LogarthSheppy @DownHereOnEarth Indeed  superb 50 year + history in robotics  and absolutely sucked for 45 years at HSF
1	Next time @BBCRadio2 wants to have an expert on to talk about meteorites  try calling one! #BIMS #IMCA pick your people there
1	@DownHereOnEarth We've not been out of LEO since 1972... methinks I'm just fed up of hearing about plans...
1	And that whoever thought it was a meteorite is talking utter #buncum #leedsmeteorite @BBCRadio2
-1	Discussion on the meteorite forums generally reaching consensus that the @BBCRadio2 item on the #leedsmeteorite was utter garbage
1	@StarkeyStardust @BBCRadio2 And slowly...but surely...they drew their plans against us... #dundunduurrr #wwaroftheworlds
-1	@StarkeyStardust @BBCRadio2 seriously  was HC p**sed? Only explanation I can think of to explain the utter bilge coming from her
1	@StarkeyStardust @BBCRadio2 Send Heather Couper... ;-)
1	@StarkeyStardust @BBCRadio2 As a director of a meteorite company  how do you think I felt? !!!
1	Good to see @BBCRadio2 Jeremy Vine show broadcasting complete https://t.co/AXvZei2LUX about the Leeds #meteorite
1	@toomanypenguin @BBCRadio2 erm... on meteorites... https://t.co/AXvZei2LUX
1	@BBCRadio2 Erm.... complete and utter https://t.co/AXvZei2LUX
1	@KSCartist @Space_Lectures @astro_timpeake proud to have one of these Tim  thank you yet again for your outstanding work
1	Delighted that some of my #apollo collection is now on display at the @spacecentre https://t.co/P11hMWo81z
1	@cbellh47 @comets77 We took quite a few images early on in 67P campaign  then it all went a bit ... well..
-1	@cbellh47 @comets77 Nor did ESA I suspect!
1	@cbellh47 @comets77 I did  very ...erm.... yes!
-1	@timmermansr Tiles and flags flown on it  very emotional...
1	@hastroparr 41 years of making sunny delight in LEO since ASTP/Skylab era... yay... we rock! (sic)
-1	@Endo_Chank @TakeThatDarwin @mbsevans seriously  you're a moron
1	Many thanks @DLR_en for your support during the Rosetta campaign. https://t.co/7HXnbCQ9hj
1	@mggtTaylor @markmccaughrean @redplanet00 Strangely also asked to upload all my data to JPL servers today  doing that now
1	@mggtTaylor @markmccaughrean @redplanet00 we did indeed  happy days!
1	@mggtTaylor @markmccaughrean @redplanet00 I don't consider myself to be part of the Rosetta sci team. Did attend early meetings though
1	@markmccaughrean @mggtTaylor @redplanet00 I think this was something done by the PACA people. I know I had a rqst for image/data
1	@markmccaughrean @mggtTaylor @redplanet00 Our team did a lot of early observations on 67P at Aphelion through to about 3 months b4 encounter
1	@markmccaughrean @mggtTaylor @redplanet00 I did work on some early Rosetta comms when contracted by EJR for you  but formal member ..no
1	@markmccaughrean @mggtTaylor @redplanet00 Just seeing this thread. What is the issue exactly? The DLR wall I was asked to submit to ages ago
1	Indeed @DavidBflower Methinks at this rate @apod could almost become a spin off of @FakeAstropix
1	So yet another faked up image on @apod today . That Mars rotation is not possible and is using HST data at best to "augment" #credibility0
1	@pilliarscreatio @hastroparr I like Glynn
1	@Blackprojects @unknownsymmetry @BestGalaxyPics We had several  and the J2 will get us out of LEO... it did in 1968-72
1	@unknownsymmetry @BestGalaxyPics It is when you've only been 450 miles in 45 years
1	@hastroparr Seen the other posts?
1	@BestGalaxyPics @unknownsymmetry only 238 000 miles more to go hey!
1	@therealdjflux Olympic sized swimming pool on steroids ;-)
-1	@RonBaalke the large hole in the skull kind of worrying though
-1	@markmccaughrean @DawnSunrise1 Only from 1974 to 1986 allegedly! ;-)
-1	@DavidBrockley @markmccaughrean My two girls being that generation... ergo furious!
1	@markmccaughrean @DawnSunrise1 Wonkspeak is also spoken by people otherwise known as wonkspanners.. change vowels as you deem necessary
-1	@markmccaughrean I think every scientist I know feels #Brexit was a catastrophe for UK science (H2020 etc). And students/Erasmus ..it's bad!
1	@ScienceNelson Let's hope come November the American people are able to see this too
-1	@markmccaughrean Shambolic... :-(
1	@Rainmaker1973 doesn't show it bouncing back off and getting lost
-1	@cosmos4u @NibleyFestival @BBCWiltshire They have a kids section which does do that  we were not doing anything "silly" at our stand!
1	@cosmos4u @NibleyFestival @BBCWiltshire lesson from that  don't believe what you read hey!
1	@cosmos4u @NibleyFestival @BBCWiltshire really...wow... silly science... H-Alpha observations  explaining the Sun.. spectroscopy... wow
1	@IgnazioMagnani @Space_Station @sukhpabial @helenczerski be still my dancing feet
1	@ruthie147 ha... you'd love to know!
-1	@destin_space @tele_education Well they can reach for low Earth orbit as that's all we've done since 1972
-1	@smashtie @AustinOnSocial @DJSnM kind of ... but none are a real threatat this time
1	@geoffnotkin @Lachtoday This means nothing to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :-)
1	@astroengine @Pillownaut brilliant... love Heather's comment!
1	@FakeAstropix @BlueshiftIRL Many thanks for your solid (as always) support.. Yes  Blueshift I think from info   didn't do it for bad reasons
1	@NorfolkStarwatc @Astroguyz Chichester is nice and not too far
1	@SpaceflightIns Apollo 15 all over again!
1	@Louiestowell Just have a look at some of the comments made by senior NASA figures about Eileen Collins' speech
1	@NASA_go4launch @NASA Can we just call it what it is... the greatest technical achievement in human history full stop  all of #Apollo
1	@ScienceNelson outstanding
1	Nice work @ScienceNelson with #mercury13 article. Have you read "Promised the Moon?" awesome book
1	@pilliarscreatio @BlueshiftIRL Hubble bubble... ;-)
1	@pilliarscreatio @BlueshiftIRL Got a new guest just checking with NASA today that it's okay for him to come over... someone you met at SF7
1	@AusAndgie7 It's taken 3 at least to get us back oto ability to leave LEO  so yup  I'd agree with that
1	@pilliarscreatio @BlueshiftIRL Did you get the Earlybird discount?
1	@pilliarscreatio @BlueshiftIRL aye...  ;-)
1	@pilliarscreatio @BlueshiftIRL The line up.... oh boy!!
-1	@markmccaughrean just so sad that people react in this way
1	@DavidGalvin9 @badas_tweets @NWAstroFest @BigUpSpaceJane @larlar1971 @ADavies915 Jane = epic!
1	Early October will see one of the greatest STEM outreach events in Europe  with astronauts from Apollo/ISS and more + me and @geoffnotkin
1	@Jane_MacArthur @Cindydelight @LaunchFever2 @Cygnusx112 just up the road from me!
1	@Astro_Adept yup
1	@Louiestowell me too!
1	@Louiestowell PMSL brilliant!
1	@Louiestowell The People's front of Judea.... or the People's Judean front?
1	@Louiestowell and Voyager grand tour  New Horizons arrival at Jupiter  Viking landing on Mars in 1976 using 1960s tech... apart from that
1	@Louiestowell Oribital insertion of the "bus sized" Cassini spacecraft through the ring plane  then deploying the deepest lander ever..
1	@Louiestowell "juno was the hardest thing NASA has ever done"... yeah  right  ranks right up there with Apollo..
1	@crocodilekatie @NASA Skycrane/MSL  Viking  Voyager  Whole Apollo program... shall we continue?
1	@crocodilekatie @NASA Exactly! Methinketh Mr Bolton will be regretting that excited statement for some time
1	Not long to go now until @CampMeteorite in the UK... if you have not booked yet  get in fast!! - https://t.co/ghQkR6SFlQ with @geoffnotkin
1	@MatanJeda @3DCreative3D @stillgray @NWAstroFest That was the retrofire console connector to the Univac
1	@hastroparr like nothing I have ever seen  in ONE HOUR!!... just wow! Thank you so much for all your help on the stand!
1	Huge thank you to @NWAstroFest @spacecentre @Jane_MacArthur @hastroparr and all great friends. This weekend a huge @MeteoritesAZ success!
1	@ScienceChannel tracking yes... defending  only in theory
1	@skyatnightmag @AsteroidDay Fund research   don't cancel the Southern Hem sky survey (McNaught etc).. and build something that can help!
1	@spaceanswers How will we "avoid" one... please tell me ;-)
1	This is always great fun to roll out on @AsteroidDay https://t.co/KvQKZNTeg1 See just how "wiped out" your location will be!
1	From next week  a major part of the Saturn V launch control system will be on loan to the @spacecentre . So happy to have made this possible
1	@hastroparr @elarastar @Johnimus_Prime Seeing him in a few weeks  then on tour with him in a few months (Al..not Simon)
1	Delivering my #apollo hardware to the @spacecentre this week for a year long loan/exhibition feature
1	One for the awesome @Jane_MacArthur https://t.co/bwcV7307tO
-1	@Jane_MacArthur @nicolablackwood With huge cuts to funding streams for so many (FP7  H2020 etc)  that's one huge threat to science
1	@RogerHighfield @HouseofCommons Understatement of the century. Science "Minister" living proof of that
1	@DrJoVian @Jane_MacArthur Awesome!
1	@Patrickm55P No  reality of what's going to happen to science funding  it's that simple
-1	@SpaceKate @rocketman528 @DrLucyRogers @genejm29 correct .. But FP7 .. Horizon2020 etc are doomed
1	@WelshMagician @geoffnotkin @MeteoritesAZ @MeteoriteMen @NickAstronomer hopefully sorted soon
1	@unknownsymmetry @NickAstronomer @AstroExeter BBC news this afternoon
1	Airbus quote reported by BBC TV News earlier today. Thank you @AstroExeter for bringing it to my attn
1	@scorrice @jimalkhalili With an IQ about 130 points higher than any of the people making comments  one would hope so
1	That Airbus quote came from my great friend @AstroExeter
1	@Astro_Adept I think they want to support the UK  but it's sound economic logic from their point to look elsewhere now
1	@Astro_Adept https://t.co/Ugd2bhhmig
1	@Astro_Adept https://t.co/1dZZjDV6Nx
1	@R_Trotta @claranellist I'd like to know who the 1% are too..
-1	@R_Trotta @claranellist Not one academic so far has with the FP7/H2020 funding decimation that's going to happen
-1	@R_Trotta @claranellist He said "not a shot was fired..." the man is a moron of quite staggering proportions
1	@David_Scanlan @RoyalAstroSoc yeah  good luck on that one
-1	@davidshukmanbbc @SPACEdotcom FP7/Horizon 2020 all shot to pieces  many academics in real fear now over lost funding
1	@claranellist FP7  Horizon 2020  Erasmus+... All EU... and yeah  good luck :-(
1	@SkyandTelescope good luck on that one!
1	@rjmlaird @RoyalAlbertHall @UKSEDS and about 170 academics so far have agreed with me
1	@rjmlaird @RoyalAlbertHall @UKSEDS Look at the reports  read what all the academics are saying
1	@WelshMagician @MeteoriteMen @MeteoritesAZ @geoffnotkin Exchange rate just collapsed.. but existing stock is okay
1	@cosmos4u yes  it is strange... people just denying the facts on science funding
-1	@cosmos4u It's very sad my friend. I don't see people as fanatical. Just trying to make sure they realise the seriousness of the problem
1	@FitzsimmonsAlan precious little else
1	@taniaj78 @markmccaughrean Just think  by the time you hit the ground  you may even get a hi-res image release of it too ;-)
1	Want to share and experinece something like this? with @geoffnotkin  WELL YOU CAN #meteoritecampuk Aug 19-21 https://t.co/26wKw945UT
1	@DawnSunrise1 Site being updated by @MeteoritesAZ as we speak... email sales@aerolite.org for info at this time
1	Reminder that not only will you be hunting meteorites with @geoffnotkin during the day  but hunting asteroids at night #meteoritecampuk
1	Got o give a HUGE thank you also to @Jane_MacArthur for her amazing support on #meteoritecampuk PhD soon Dr MacArthur in meteoritics #epic
1	@Cosmic_Carol @MeteoritesAZ fantabulous!!!
1	#meteoritecampuk is being hosted by Emmy award winning TV host and world famous meteorite hunter @geoffnotkin from @MeteoriteMen
1	@BadAstronomer @FakeAstropix like APOD you mean? ;-)
1	@davemomo @BIS_spaceflight that's the beastie... mine doesn't look quite as neat though ;-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 @CampMeteorite news coming soon!
1	@iamscicomm Just go to or look at @spacefest and you'll see the impact art has on sci comm.. Al Bean  Mike Collins  Ron Wood  Nicole Stott..
1	@geoffnotkin @Spacefest I'll send some mobile shots but mark has the good ones
1	@elarastar @geoffnotkin my only hope is that the TSA do
1	@hellospacething @MeteoritesAZ @Jane_MacArthur it will be yours!
1	@Cosmic_Carol My pleasure!!
1	@markmccaughrean @RadioKate @FrankMillerInk A very real prospect though..
1	@Astro_Adept @DailyMailUK :-) true... maybe DM and the National Enquirer should team up?
-1	@Astro_Adept The @DailyMailUK would not know a science story if it dropped like an asteroid on their heads... toilet roll of the worst form
-1	@markmccaughrean @RadioKate That gallery may put Trump in power come November... nothing scares me more
1	@unknownsymmetry A great book!
1	@hastroparr @markstewartprod told ya! ;-)
1	@ShaneMcC @claranellist Trump can barely string a sentence together that contains fact.. I have no hope if he gets in
1	@ShaneMcC @claranellist I agree  support is not 100%  never will be... but would you rather spent 700 billion USD on killing people?
1	@Buzzs_xtina See you Friday... be nice to catch up (Spacefest you kindly put me in touch with Chris Lewicki)
1	@SullivansProjs @Spacefest @LastManOnMoon moh yes  well known for Apollo 10 fans
1	@Markthemallet @hastroparr I get there v late Saturday
1	The BIG REVEAL.... coming to @Spacefest a special preview of this amzing new film from the @LastManOnMoon team https://t.co/s5N1OoQGAQ
1	@crocodilekatie @elarastar you take care ...
-1	@Cosmic_Carol can send before so you avoid import duty if that helps
1	@Cosmic_Carol @Spacefest by far one of the best of the biogs
1	@RocketmanJRS yo yo yo
-1	@astro_carl @LibbyJackson__ @mars_stu I guess that 70% of press are just idiots then
-1	@SP_JohnSullivan @NASAhistory @xandaolp @Spacefest huh? John it's only your politics I disagree with  I wish you'd stop saying stuff
1	@AstroScholarFdn @astro_DonThomas @ISS_CASIS and you and Kathy absolutely do that!
1	@AndrewRixLtd @DavidBflower £48 billion on HS2.... £75 million on Tim Peake...
1	@AndrewRixLtd @DavidBflower Helen Sharman was the first British astronaut  it all comes down to how you spin it...
-1	@simcourtie @LibbyJackson__ @mars_stu @BBCWiltshire Mail  Express  Sun  Mirror and main BBC news channel maybe missed that memo ;-)
1	@simcourtie @LibbyJackson__ @mars_stu @BBCWiltshire awesome... and you guys have done a great job on that front
1	@LibbyJackson__ @mars_stu Journalists get their info from somwehere. If it was clarified from day one  maybe it would not have happened
1	@mars_stu @LibbyJackson__ It all comes from the source material...
1	@mars_stu very true Tim has been nothing but exemplary
-1	@jen_gupta @govender @_EliGrant @coffee_samurai outreach should never compete  and absolutely not when it's for benefit for disabled kids
1	@jen_gupta @govender @_EliGrant @coffee_samurai very complimentary from what I can see as TS project is different focus
1	@jen_gupta @govender @_EliGrant @coffee_samurai very interesting in light of the  funded project for https://t.co/L2eklb0sts
-1	@JPMajor and will be 70 years since we last did anything significant in human spaceflight... very depressing how we have regressed so badly
-1	@genejm29 ah  sorry that's not what you mentioned  you said first succesful landing on Mars... sorry!
1	@genejm29 no  the Mars lander did transmit  ergo successful landing and sent data..
1	@genejm29 Russia was the first to successfully land on Mars for all of 30 seconds...  #facts
-1	@RhEvans41 @NASAhistory Gordo didn't help himself with his "reluctance" to train in sims etc... but still...
1	@RhEvans41 @NASAhistory Deke and Al Shepard' close friendship
-1	@RhEvans41 @NASAhistory a manual landing at that... the guy knew how to fly  but got "canned" (spammed) from Apollo because of bias
1	@RhEvans41 @NASAhistory Closest carrier landing pretty much ever... that's not a lightweight
1	@NASAhistory @RhEvans41 and then gets canned from Apollo for "not pulling his weight enough in training".. after a perfect Mercury mission
1	@RonBaalke @geoffnotkin @LibbyLegs Sadly clouded out on the scopes or I'd have had a blast at imaging it
1	@einionyn @Braun23Austin @apod good as that other gif is clearly fake
1	@PeoplesAstro @DrBrianMay @alifeofriley @DrAliceRoberts @daraobriain agreed
1	@pilliarscreatio am donating one of them to the @NAF_Ataxia auction at @Spacefest Hoping that all the astros will sign that one too
1	@pilliarscreatio @Spacefest @Cosmic_Carol I own the original 1968 schematics from whence that came https://t.co/jWaCOQg0DW
1	@AstroCourses @AfricaAstronomy Terrific  I'll spread the word (Don't know if you knew  I worked for the SKA project in UK for two years)
1	@AstroCourses @AfricaAstronomy URL?
1	@DavidBrockley Agreed  petition starter needs to fix that
1	@geoffnotkin @Spacefest epic
-1	@hellospacething @MeteoriteMen The audio was not great  but it was a life changing event for me!
1	@unknownsymmetry was great
-1	@hastroparr yup  money grabbing as ever
-1	Want a WORLD FIRST look at the film shoot for the new movie previewing at @Spacefest from the @LastManOnMoon team? https://t.co/WOcQKkJGFB
1	@cosmos4u Kind of agree... given we've sucked so badly at HSF for 44 years  but it's a fine achievement
1	@Cosmic_Carol nice... can recommend Kitt Peak  Mt Lemmon  Barringer Crater  Mirror Lab at UOA  Biosphere 2..
1	@radjanirad a wookie cookie.... epic!!
1	@Cosmic_Carol The hotel aircon is amazing Carol  you'll be fine  and we only ever go outside in the evening for drinks  it is mentally hot
1	@hastroparr Indeed I have one!
1	@deicherstar @hastroparr @AstronomyMag @AlanStern But Alan is cool  so I'll let this one pass ;-)
1	@ibookery Much like the ones on the AGC and DSKY... ya know  the ones that got us to the Moon and back 9 times ;-)
1	@ibookery Sandy had the ICC-0081 and Sharp had the EL-8 at the same time as Cernan/Duke et al were driving lunar rovers though ;-)
1	@ibookery true  I was kind of working on clock cycles/cpu/memory ... ;-) and trying not to confuse the public too much
-1	@ibookery sorry  I missed a few digits... 800 000 000 times ;-)
-1	@ibookery That thing 800 000 times less powerful than the computers we're using the languish in Low Earth Orbit for 44 years with ;-)
1	@TonyToners @imascientist @claranellist @Jo_Do I agree with that sentiment 100%
-1	@TonyToners @claranellist @Jo_Do Yes  they're called idiots I do believe...
1	To all friends in the U.S.A @LastManOnMoon is now out and available on DVD and Blu Ray to order....
1	@imascientist @claranellist @Jo_Do That's not what it says. or how it's being pitched with that strap line. that's my point
1	@markmccaughrean @sarahkendrew That's what we want to hear Mark... get that big scope to orbit!!
1	Huge thank you to the @LastManOnMoon team for their amazing donations to the @NAF_Ataxia auction at @Spacefest
1	@markmccaughrean @sarahkendrew Just make sure that the Ariane works.... that's pretty much what the world wants first!
1	@claranellist @Jo_Do @imascientist Perfect  happy to help. It's a topic I am very passionate about (that and comet hunting)
1	@claranellist @imascientist Point me at it..  I work with a slew of Apollo astronauts on a day by day basis
1	@claranellist @imascientist the process of sending is a better way of pitching it.. not "should we"... as that's nonsenical
1	@imascientist @claranellist It's akin to asking "should we just languish in LEO for 44 years  growing seeds &amp; converting pee in to Sunny D"
1	@imascientist @claranellist There is no debate here... literally no debate whatsoever
1	@pilliarscreatio @Spacefest @NAF_Ataxia if you want to give all the money to a great cause  then I am sure someone would
1	Wow @apod scammed again... M31 backdrop... yeah right!
1	@SpaceportNQY @david_hurn we can't even get out of LEO right now
1	@markmccaughrean @hastroparr @geoffnotkin @MeteoritesAZ @Jane_MacArthur @beccagladden if it's any consolation ..you're one of mine
1	@geoffnotkin @MeteoritesAZ @Jane_MacArthur @hastroparr @beccagladden thank you G
-1	@Tsenzee Suspect a bit of both... would need to see research paper though
1	@TheAntmagic @Jane_MacArthur @hastroparr thank you so much
1	And in the days before sat nav  some useful directions for how to get there..  @LastManOnMoon https://t.co/1t70rO78od
1	I even have the laminated @LastManOnMoon pass to go with it... lol https://t.co/zuRO7dAKEN
1	So my party invite for @LastManOnMoon arrived a little late... need to find a suitable tie and jacket ;-) https://t.co/zRwPj7gM7j
1	The awesome @LastManOnMoon is now available IN THE UK on @iTunes !!!! awesome!!!
1	@geoffnotkin @Spacefest I'll DM you
1	@AstroExeter That's easy... rocket blower tastic time
1	@AstroExeter That's a fantastic first light John!
1	@Blackprojects I have a few things Gunter touched and signed mate
-1	@hastroparr @gazsc @giffgaff @WhichUK looking at alternative providers  sick of the sneaky way Goff Gaff are behaving
1	@hastroparr @gazsc @giffgaff @WhichUK 3GB was okay  2GB is just to get people to "upgrade" and pay more... well guess what... it won't fly
1	Agreed @DavidBflower @giffgaff @WhichUK am now considering moving provider... it's not on to do this... not with the profits being made!
1	My way of celebrating the awesome @LastManOnMoon ... and yes that last one IS Gene's personal cue card for Apollo 17 https://t.co/FaWULRrLKY
1	@GNU_Ninja I have  and to a man  they are all incredible... My 10yo has met 4 of them  and Al Worden is her fave
1	@GNU_Ninja Jack is and was a legend for sure... Gene has always been a hero to me though
1	All of us at @Spacefest would like to thank one of our amazing sponsors. One of the team behind @LastManOnMoon The awesome #HavilandDigital
1	@GabrielleNYC @thedrive I'd imaging a bit slower than doing it at 25 000mph ;-) #apollo15
1	@geoffnotkin @MeteoritesAZ minor rock star .. Lol
-1	@WiredUK Your reviwer is clearly incompetent - https://t.co/Ldk7LgGK88   but then you always get one I guess
1	91% so far on @RottenTomatoes for @LastManOnMoon proves that it is pretty much universally loved by everyone...
1	Wow. Matt Reynolds at @WiredUK I'd love to know what film you saw  as that review is beyond a joke!
1	@sparklefingered @LastManOnMoon U.S side I think they have some agreements in place. UK I hope "watch this space"... BUT see it in Cinema!
1	If you're booked to see @LastManOnMoon this week and are even thinking of pulling out... trust me DON'T... the film is utterly outstanding
1	@pilliarscreatio Mike is not no...
1	@pilliarscreatio When/after it's signed at Spacefest I will ;-)
1	@Cosmic_Carol Also DBS is useful
1	@WilMcQueen @NASAJPL @NolaTRedd Did find a load of asteroids ... ;-) (and assist on a few comets - https://t.co/GdmGdjxX5K
1	@WilMcQueen @NASAJPL @NolaTRedd no... but tricky to type on mobile :-)
1	@bbc5live Want to talk meteorites w/Director of World's largest meteorite company? DM...
1	@WillGompertzBBC @bbc5live @NaughtyBoyMusic @ben_watt @claraamfo @GrainneMaguire @Rosiemillard meteorite talk..!!!
1	@bbc5live just saw @WillGompertzBBC is talking meteorites ..check my profile ..happy to chat on air
1	Ha ..#TheHuntsman may be trending  but the greatest UK film release coming in April is @LastManOnMoon by a country mile!!
-1	Film critics and their reviews usually suck... not when the @LastManOnMoon reviews #TheMartian https://t.co/UvzSPHVo5X #differentballgame
1	Ramp up the awesome... @LastManOnMoon UK release info - https://t.co/qjiBtuOAJ4
1	@TheAntmagic @geoffnotkin @MeteoriteMen @MHUnlimited @RAWAstro looks real and interesting
-1	@markmccaughrean outstanding player... will be sorely missed and way too young to die
1	@pilliarscreatio @Spacefest Al and Dave are there!
1	@pilliarscreatio Oh yes! ... I have the mission reports signed  that's nice!
1	@markmccaughrean #tumbleweed #wagner
1	@GNU_Ninja @markmccaughrean @geoffnotkin We have a sale on too!
1	@GNU_Ninja @markmccaughrean @geoffnotkin happy to help
1	@iamscicomm Mafia style backstabbing by some members of the community would get my vote
1	One for @FakeAstropix of the Mercury Transit (in May) featuring @DrBrianMay (H/T Pete Ainsworth for image) https://t.co/tgEUMOErrC
1	@pilliarscreatio Yup  and one of the few locations you can show your kids with clarity and say "look that's where a spacecraft landed"
1	@pilliarscreatio Hadley and the Feather drop  plus Al is a good buddy
1	@DavidBrockley Next week Charlie Bolden says that "Richard Feynman was an asshat who really didn't get physics" ;-)
1	@Blackprojects I may well be :-)
1	@pilliarscreatio Always  I have about 18 talks lined up so far this year
1	@faulkestel @Blackprojects Packaging them all up now (was at home yesterday so limitede network access). Remote scheduled scope not ideal
1	@Blackprojects no definite yet
1	@markmccaughrean @ESA_ExoMars @bbcworldservice @KCBSNews may have imaged your little spacecraft in orbit Mark..twice https://t.co/9pDjrmkhJo
1	@ruthie147 Hear hear!...
1	@hastroparr "boom boom boom" by the Black Eyed Peas? ;-)
1	Median was a nanolander developed by myself and @Jane_MacArthur set to detect methane concentrations on Mars. Worked on some years ago
1	@TheAntmagic @geoffnotkin @MeteoriteMen love love love
-1	@milind_kawli @JPMajor @AstroAnarchy Oh he will be the Republican nominee  how scary is that!?
1	@JPMajor @AstroAnarchy His brown skin shining in the sun... his hair quiffed back... radio on ....
1	@TomWatts28 I'll Dm you Tom
-1	@grb090423 @FGW every day .. But today is staggeringly bad
1	@DownHereOnEarth Dm'd you info
1	@sciencefocus I think the word you're looking for isn't "haunting" it's "Depressing"
1	@daverothery All set for transit coverage from Geneva!
1	@thehighfrontier @Cosmic_Carol They should  they're about as reliable as a Trabant
1	@grb090423 @Cosmic_Carol @esa indeed... would be a nice first
1	@Cosmic_Carol If I were ESA... I'd be bricking it on that fact...
1	@Cosmic_Carol bear this in mind... not one Russian launched vehicle has EVER successfully made it to the surface of Mars and worked
1	@Blackprojects @MeteoritesAZ I am indeed! and meteorites!
1	@markmccaughrean @ESA_ExoMars Very best of luck with that one
1	@martiansoil @ESA_ExoMars Best of luck with that one
-1	@hastroparr @geoffnotkin Doesn't look meteoritic :-(
1	@CNET How most people outside of the USA feel.. h/t to my good buddy Kyle Sullivan for the artwork https://t.co/Ed2WTIBOTH
1	If you're in London ... DO NOT MISS THIS! - https://t.co/NBzaL9y26S @BIS_spaceflight Don is an awesome speaker!! @astro_DonThomas
1	@BIS_spaceflight @sgcsalmon @NASA @astro_DonThomas Don is so great. We loved him at @cosmicon and will see him at @Spacefest
1	@AstroAnarchy @FoxNews @CNN @DailyMailUK I'd also like to see science reporters who have legit twitter followers  not fake ones!
1	@AstroAnarchy Well  between @foxnews @cnn and @DailyMailUK I think any notion of science reporting went out the window a long time ago
1	Shout out for all friends of both me and @MeteoriteMen to support this remarkable lady and her bid to do #epicstuff https://t.co/oR0HbVk4Cr
1	My awesome friend @Jane_MacArthur needs support to help her win one of only 8 places to visit ESO plz RT her pinned post! #astronomy #space
1	@Jane_MacArthur @astro_timpeake @cns_school @NorwichSchool @ReephamHigh oooh you're doing one of them too!...cool
1	@Jon_Berkemeyer I was only focussing on the technical aspects ;-)
-1	@hastroparr To show what incompetent coding looks like?
1	@Blackprojects Thank you Mark
1	@unknownsymmetry Mission reports..... unbeatable
1	@sciencemuseum @Damien_Wev @norfolkbookworm Note... test your servers ;-)
1	@SerendipitySays from the deflection sensitivity I saw/read/reported on  they may need to
1	@JeffreyRSnively @starstryder I don't know  I've seen those !
1	@JeffreyRSnively @starstryder Nothing was official unless you had the embargoed PR ;-)
1	For all of you who use iTunes... the incredible @LastManOnMoon movie is one to own - https://t.co/XRzBPDZUwc #apollo #space
1	@AstroExeter She's on the literal top of my top 10 list of people in life I want to meet and just say "Thank you" to
1	Congrats to the immense @LastManOnMoon team for their superb award https://t.co/ZChDxH4YYV #apollo #legend #Cernan #space #astronomy
1	@DavidGalvin9 Picking up easily on an FSQ106 in 30s
1	@DavidGalvin9 14.2 from a stack of 5 images ref UCAC
1	@DavidGalvin9 Abouty 14.5 according to astrometrica from one image  but I'd rather get more data on it
1	@romn8tr @SpaceX I have not heard
1	@fattcslim78 @carolynporco seconded
1	@timmermansr Research done over 50 years ago... all great! Give someone a kick will you  the delay line is making it almost impossible
1	@timmermansr  ablation ;-)
-1	@DawnSunrise1 yeah "chasing squid" (aka low frequency submarine sonar completely screwing them over)
1	@PeoplesAstro @cosmos4u @BBCNews @BBCWorld its on sky news now
-1	@janeway47 @SkyNews Sky featured him just now ... @BBCNews should be ashamed
1	@pete20cwt @PeoplesAstro @cosmos4u @BBCNews @BBCWorld sky news showed him .. Excellent
-1	@PeoplesAstro @cosmos4u @BBCNews @BBCWorld and how wrong is that .!!
1	@pilliarscreatio @elliottucker @BBCNews well said
1	@Blackprojects @BBCNews just up.. Wupdeedoo
1	@cosmos4u @BBCNews @BBCWorld I saw ...
1	@cottonscience @MeteoriteMen or a StrewnField of Scientists
1	@MeteoriteMen A Matrix of meteoritehunters
-1	@GabrielleNYC very!!.... #ripoffbritain #ukgovt #tax
1	Interesting from @airandspace mag - https://t.co/z2zMkmywKs
1	@timmermansr @sciencemuseum It's a stunning exhibition... you'll love it
1	@Blackprojects @Astro_yyz It is ... but we're still looking
1	@astrotomato How... just how...
1	@HAL9000and1 Get @geoffnotkin 's superb book on the subject   and get thee to a known strewn field (desert locations = good)
-1	@markmccaughrean @AstroExeter having had science data stolen by "professionals" on more than one occasion  I see very little difference ;-)
-1	@AquilaRift @markmccaughrean @cosmos4u I put in inordinate amounts of work to imaging (and the science aspects) so it baffles me too
-1	@markmccaughrean owch... well  he's been had and admitted it @cosmos4u I think knows more about the whole saga
1	@markmccaughrean Signed copy :-)
1	@markmccaughrean All over Facebook  astronomy forums it seems
-1	@markmccaughrean and the guy who took it has now admitted he faked it and has removed his image from website
1	@markmccaughrean The image composite is impossible  given the frame rates and definition on Saturn
1	@AstrogatorJohn @apod no  some good photoshoppping
1	One for @FakeAstropix https://t.co/meb3f2IakU The "APOD" that isn't @apod
1	@hastroparr @apod anyone with a basic knowledge of astro imaging would have
1	So the @apod is a fraud (The Saturn ISS transit) and NOBODY spotted it at APOD... wow...
1	@Cosmic_Carol @Spacefest awesomeness!!!
1	@Cosmic_Carol @Spacefest Are you coming Carol!.... eeep!!
1	@TakeThatNASA No  I have enjoyed the laugh at the morons who post on your feed.. ;-)
1	Oh I just found my new fave Twitter account @TakeThatNASA ... Follow  and just relish in the joy of the idiocy of people
1	@merciajew @TakeThatNASA @MikeSainty @almurray No  I feel the same as I have for the past 46 years
-1	@merciajew @TakeThatNASA @MikeSainty @almurray God you're a moron...an utter utter moron
1	@stem_network @Jane_MacArthur https://t.co/PphUzYViQs Jane tested Median in Morocco...
1	@stem_network prime candidate for a project I worked on with @Jane_MacArthur some years ago to build a Mars lander #Median
1	The @LastManOnMoon will be one of THREE films shown at @Spacefest in June
1	@RussianSpaceWeb There's a reason you're on my space history panel at @spacefest Great work as ever
1	@SpaceKate yay!!!... go Kate go !!!
1	@HAL9000and1 now THAT was a Shuttle flight!!... That up to about STS6 and then the HST repair missions... all amazing
1	@HAL9000and1 Wait until you see the film... it's incredible @LastManOnMoon

1	@rincon_p @markmccaughrean @BBCAmos @jjaron ha ha ha!
1	@rincon_p @markmccaughrean @BBCAmos @jjaron "official British" is only two
1	@rincon_p @markmccaughrean @BBCAmos @jjaron Paul  thank you.. It was that the headline was misleading in opinion of many
1	@markmccaughrean @RainerKresken See the film first Mark  the book is vastly superior  and less "artistic" lic used
-1	@markmccaughrean @AstroExeter I just worry that if we ever do find Snoopy  what will lurk within https://t.co/75iKzZTNUG

1	@ESA_History @IFLScience which is correct !!
-1	@astrotomato Monopoly is one of the world's leading games... seems ...just stupid really

1	@russss @vruba Color balance is a tricky topic  but key thing is that DSCOVR shows true global geometry; the Suomi NPP image does not.
1	@dcastelvecchi Earlier publication implies 2 part strategy: local soil only first  then added nitrogen for harvest. https://t.co/CKnOvfe3z0
1	@LonelyProbe Uh oh--the moon is escaping anyway  just very slowly (about 3.8 cm/year). We're going to need a stronger lasso.
1	@DavidHesperos Implication is that it's been slowly freezing pretty much that whole time. We just caught it before the final stage.
-1	@DavidHesperos @gmusser Presence of expansion faults indicates partial freezing; absence of large subsidence implies not fully frozen.
1	@dcastelvecchi Maybe a gateway to an international moon base  which would be genuinely exciting...

-1	@boundangle FYI  I ridiculed her tweet. Phil &amp; Emily engaged and had a more useful effect. A tribute to them  not a defense of Greta.

-1	@StartsWithABang [clears throat] So  um  as I was saying  it is a dead asteroid  or "rock comet."
-1	@StartsWithABang That's my question: Volatile loss means you can never get a stable crust on a comet?
1	@boundangle @StartsWithABang Water is very abundant  cosmically speaking. Making it is easy; keeping it is the bigger issue.
1	@StartsWithABang Wouldn't a baked KBO with a dehydrated silicate mantle look a lot like an asteroid? Or are there just too much volatiles?
1	@StartsWithABang OK  prob an asteroidal "rock comet"! But couldn't the same mechanism affect a dehydrated comet? https://t.co/83SMJw3I9v

1	@Rainmaker1973 @cosmos4u Doesn't 1st observation of pulses count as 1st observation that recognized it as a pulsar?
1	@albiondumsday About 600 million light years away--not that far in the cosmic sense  but way beyond our local galaxy cluster.
-1	@skdh @AstroKatie @RobertGaristo How is it wrong to say the LHC is recreating the QGP conditions of the (post)BB? Asking seriously.
1	@skdh @AstroKatie @RobertGaristo I meant BB as shorthand to include the QGP era of 10**-5 seconds--reasonable in 140 characters  I think.

1	@gstalnaker Aww!!
1	@gstalnaker Aww! We love our weirdo doggers.
1	@gstalnaker Right?! They are complex creatures with a whole lot of feelings and instincts! Not just inert teddy bears.
1	@gstalnaker It's hard because other dogs are THE MOST INTERESTING THING IN THE WORLD to her.
1	@gstalnaker We've been through training and tried a lot of techniques. Her name and a high value treat seem to be the best distractors
1	@gstalnaker A bit! She's now about 6 years old. Adopted her two years ago.
1	@MichaelJewell78 She's wonderful at off-leash play  though  with dogs who are similarly social. Daycare is the best thing ever.
1	@MichaelJewell78 Yeah  she sees another dog and WANTS TO SNIFF THEM AND GREET THEM AND OMG WHY CANT I GET TO YOU FREAK OUT
1	@gstalnaker Also the top clip harness made her pull harder. Size makes a big difference in what works for your dog
-1	@gstalnaker Wow  really??? I tried a retractable lead once and hated it! But my dog is 45 lbs so it was useless with her.
1	@MichaelJewell78 Yeah it gets her turned away like it should  be she's still agitated and barking like a nutter.
1	@MichaelJewell78 It's so funny... I literally have a closet full of leashes  harnesses  etc that we've tried :-P
1	@MichaelJewell78 distract with treat and move quickly are my best options. We use a martingale chain collar that has worked best
1	@MichaelJewell78 Thanks! Tried that! Didn't quite work for her.

1	@LeMoustier @Paleophile we just met here!
-1	@yayitsrob @xeni this. And letting the CDC do the damn research
1	@xeni @k_brewster come on down  we're here!
1	@Paleophile YOU'RE ONE OF THE ONES WITH A PUP!
1	@kejames @Paleophile thank you and hello!
1	@sharkespearean This ep of Science for the People from way back touched on that https://t.co/oec3gqFJuX
-1	@DaveMosher @GameOfThrones I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING! Though they were HUGE  coulda been cane corso? The cropped ears tho :*(
1	@LMFinney https://t.co/3kHbRxg42M
1	@LMFinney My only trick was to have similarly obsessed friends alert me when they found any. Thanks  @cpillsbury!
1	@sondy congrats!
1	@rappolee dogs &gt;&gt; people. Always
1	"To be fair  my roomba is kind of a monkey." @sharkespearean #IPSEC2016
1	@DrMRFrancis Happy to endorse you if needed once I get back in :-)
1	@DrRubidium This is amazing. Thank you
1	@theuxicorn @Sargent @DrRubidium OMG
1	@Sargent @DrRubidium SCIENCE BABIES! MUST MAKE SCIENCE BABIES
1	@DrRubidium @DNLee5 &lt;3
-1	@DrRubidium @CurlyHairMafia @_adverbia @DNLee5 @MockTM OMG YOU'RE HATE WATCHING #TheCore?! &lt;3
1	@maeglin73 Thanks! Don't know. That's a good question for @starstryder :-)
1	@astraughnomer PLAY WIF MEE
1	@mcnees hug you TO PIECES
-1	@mcnees with a laser blasting crossbow? I doubt it.
-1	@mcnees CHEWIE SHOT FIRST
1	@JLGalache thanks! Hope sooo
1	@DrMRFrancis Ooooo I think so.
-1	@astrokatey @rareflwr41 *sigh* yup that :-(
1	@Tim_O_Brien I'll be sure to share my experiences!
1	@Blackmudpuppy @StudentofWhim @starstryder HALLO!
1	@rdcrisp @GeekGirlCon LOLOLOL SO MUCH LOL
1	@rappolee Milky Way in infrared :-) (well multiwavelength)
1	@InvaderXan I'm thinking the tutu could use a bit more H-alpha
1	.@rdcrisp in case you didn't know  @GeekGirlCon does not exclude any gender
1	@mcnees there are donuts
-1	@BruceMcCurdy I don't think it carries the same diminutive meaning as girls. But it sounds awkward  at least when I say it?
1	@MichaelJewell78 well if that's the case  I'd like my identifier to be "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
-1	@Cosmic_Carol @Leaving_Orbit @gottie29 Yes! Apparently I was facing west most of the day. So I only burned on my left.
1	@PlanetDr However that did some in handy when I had to quickly check to make sure it was less dense than water.
1	Thanks to @MarsRoverUH for giving our physics colloquium talk today @SaintAnselm!
1	@DownHereOnEarth definitely @dog_rates
1	@DrMRFrancis OOps
-1	@startorialist I can't believe I missed this!
1	#SpacePants @startorialist https://t.co/m8VEmZHzk2 via
1	@NGC3314 OOF
1	@NGC3314 @zeepxanflorp The visual of a fidding  dancing mantis shrimp on a rooftop amuses me so much right now
1	@merrdiff YOU GO GIRL!
1	@upulie I know exactly who you are talking about
1	@DrRubidium @drmagoo oooh I like the citation
1	@drmagoo @DrRubidium curious how you both do it? I ask for "What you did wrong and what is correct and why?" I hope it helps
-1	@mcnees @mikamckinnon @DrMRFrancis @DrRubidium @RachelFeltman @scicurious @DNLee5 Would watch the HELL out of this
1	.@dalcantonJD @startorialist we need to start an official club. #MaceyTheMighty https://t.co/3eBQ5DGyOB
1	@dalcantonJD @startorialist OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!
1	@merrdiff @dustchick adulting! Woo!
-1	@OtherOrbScience @lynn_carter8 @sondy those that will mentor grads  I can remind to not be shitty. While I try to not be shitty to my ugrads
1	@OtherOrbScience @lynn_carter8 @sondy 3rd-ing the good friends thing. Something about suffering together...
-1	@xeni odd how shame looks like Spider-Man?
1	@mcnees My GODDAMNED SELF that good enough for ya?! ;-)
1	@LMFinney apparently
1	@DrRubidium @roseveleth YUP
1	@sondy @mikamckinnon @HopeJahren this reminds me of the con where ppl assumed @Sargent and I were married then encouraged me to make babies
1	@astronomyblog @cosmicpudding 3C84! Once I used it as a calibrator for something else but the data were so good it got its own paper
1	@tarahaelle @AstroKatie @starstryder tweet gone?
-1	@DrMRFrancis @neiltyson @ejwillingham So goddamn frustrating.
-1	@DrRubidium Argh. I hate when conferences do that
1	@sondy YUP
1	@MarsRoverUH @laurahelmuth Thanks! Or #scicomm high five? I'd love to get back to #sxsw one of these years :-)
1	@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy o.O
1	@mcnees Which only furthers my hypothesis that dogs are much better than people.
1	@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy pretty!!!! Looking up  at least for a while  helps when things here are so troubling.
1	@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy Ah  that's certainly good in theory  but respectability politics is tired  e.g. https://t.co/aChHMMUVot
1	@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy I see a LOT more of people telling #BlackLivesMatter and others to be quiet  like that's going to make racism better
1	@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy i'm no constitutional scholar  but pretty sure ppl are legally allowed to be racist asshats. I'm not happy about it
-1	@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy depends what they are doing. Even vile speech is constitutionally protected. Crosses line at inciting violence
-1	@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy Sure. They have a right to speak and to protest. ppl asking these protestors to stop are sayin take racism quietly
1	@rdcrisp @bergopolis @neiltyson @realDonaldTrump um  k.
1	@rdcrisp @bergopolis @neiltyson @realDonaldTrump In one sense yes  but in another sense  even we astronomers are voting citizens w/ opinions
1	@sciencenotscary @tanyaofmars I've since learned to tuck the bag under the windshield wipers :-)
-1	@sciencenotscary @tanyaofmars Recently Macey pooed while we were out and no garbage  so I put it in my car to bring home to the dumpster. EW
-1	@sciencenotscary @tanyaofmars Oh FFS.
-1	@tanyaofmars Ugh. People are just awful
1	@tanyaofmars glad to hear it's probably not entirely BS though :-)
1	@tanyaofmars we've had so many problems getting management and maintenance to communicate on ANYTHING though :-P
1	@tanyaofmars No one collects samples here. And I've offered to do it for them and they are like  "no  it's a process." WUT
1	@DavidBflower Thanks!!!
1	@PlanetDr Hmmm... I need to work on that. We DO have a pub on our campus!
1	@DrMRFrancis I'm so glad they got a statement from Aaron Parsons in there. But the beginning and other parts are so troublesome.
1	@albertoconti @Discovery @blakebullock Nice!
1	@albertoconti @Discovery Catching the rebroadcast. Did I just see you in a bunny suit?
-1	@astrogrant @PeterDEdmonds I've been accused of being part of the "black hole conspiracy."
1	@sondy @xeni @michael_w_busch I get it. Aliens are amazeballs. I'm teaching a course about the topic this semester :-)
1	@ChipotleTweets Thanks!
1	Never got my #raincheck offer code from texting @ChipotleTweets last week. Maybe it went to that guy in DC I'm hearing about on @waitwait?
1	@Nerdista @DrMRFrancis If ONLY the great hair came standard
1	@wdonohue @prenerk OMG crooked earred dogs just look CUTER
-1	@prenerk Ew. That's ridiculous. Humans are ew.
1	@MarsRoverUH Oof
1	@fizzixrat @MarsRoverUH hard as I try... it never comes out
1	@MarsRoverUH Um  maybe knees and back  too
1	@MarsRoverUH Young at heart is all that matters!
1	@DNLee5 @shaka_lulu @IBJIYONGI @aomawa @Summer_Ash @ThePurplePage *hugs* you are all amazing ladies!
1	@mikamckinnon Hahaha I hadn't seen this yet! If I have time between class prep? Are there instructions somewhere or just go for it?
1	@NGC3314 But then I'd have to pay attention to pop culture! :-P
-1	@CatherineQ @starstryder dammit I missed that one walking the dog
-1	@RyanWVoll @AstroAnarchy @ThreeIfBySpace :-(
1	@RyanWVoll @AstroAnarchy *grump* what about https://t.co/cZUkjThcde ?
-1	@kejames both parties are faculty/staff/commuter parking stealers  really. #BigIssues
1	@kejames YUP. But so did the December Dem debate.
1	@starstryder https://t.co/mozt2Wzqk9
-1	@reneehlozek That's what actually caused the screaming... Just hoping that wasn't any of my students/colleagues....
1	@DrMRFrancis All I'm saying is that they better disinfect that fitness center before they reopen it.
1	@DrMRFrancis They were treating the pre-debate like a pre-game show
1	@DrMRFrancis DON'T KNOW WHAT I"M TALKING ABOUT? HERE IS A GOOGLE! :-P
1	@DrMRFrancis Thank you for taking me off that thread as it got started. You have far more patience than I do.
1	@fcain Pretty pretty VLBI blobs
1	@VealSlab That's just too early for kids. Sheesh
1	@VealSlab oof!
1	@VealSlab Honestly  my dog has been waking me at 5am for potty anyway  I think thats the only reason it's plausible that I'll be up
1	@DrMRFrancis Kind of hard to make mandatory unless I want to hold a lot of them. Which I don't :-P
1	@DrMRFrancis I'm not sure I want to get out of bed that early. Plus I have to schedule last minute b/c weather.
1	@merrdiff Only one pic means you were having too much fun to take pictures! :-)
1	@merrdiff @annafrebel Cool! I like the better accuracy  but might be a bit jargon-y for my purpose in class. But that I can work with...
1	Cool! h/t @merrdiff  https://t.co/Rtdca0mFzR
1	@The_NobleWoman We're about to have our second on-campus debate. Screws up everything for a solid week.
1	@LMFinney @SurlyAmy Yup  it was custom. There is an itty bitty Martian meteorite inside the glass vial
1	@sondy @Summer_Ash Which season? I used to prefer 5 but lately I've been feeling 7
1	@kelleytastic I'm breaking that rule just for Mulder and Scully
1	@kelleytastic D'oh! At least you didn't miss it
-1	@DrRubidium Are you kidding?! I wouldn't even call a dog a half-breed. WTF
1	@Gee_Kate @paganforge @OmanReagan Indeed!! :-)
1	@MasaCritit OMG right?! The Solar System fits in my pocket except the Oort Cloud  yeah that's down the street.
-1	@shubclimate Some people might be panicking that their bad behavior will be made public  but the harassment has been going on for long time
1	@DrMRFrancis did they have pitchforks?
-1	Since the quantitative analysis intro lab made everyone just about cry last semester... cc @starstryder @PatrickDurrell
1	@danwest it'll be required viewing for the class!
1	@poniosun @baserunner0723 @ulalaunch likewise
1	@Blkwooly platinum  gold  refractory metals...
1	@CJDaniels77 Yes. But you have to come to ULA to fond out
1	@Blkwooly Only at first.  CisLunar space has abundant supplies of fuel and other resources rare on earth
1	@CJDaniels77 Ask me after the 8th
1	@SpaceBrendan @codydschultz Vocation  not a degree. Endless possibilities.  32 yrs  &gt;26 rockets  9 hyprsncs  4 lasers...and I'm still going
1	@Kalti @ArtOfAstronomy  The notches are there to support alignment fixtures. Once motors are aligned  we back-fill with cork and thermal RTV
1	@ArtOfAstronomy The notches are there to support alignment fixtures. Once motors are aligned  we back-fill with cork and thermal RTV
-1	@CJDaniels77 Unlikely to see a complete abandonment of SRBs
1	@CJDaniels77 I like to think of it as a metaphor for the challenge of transformation...
1	.@GreenJimll @elonmusk We kept ABL at Edwards AFB when the secret base under the volcano wasn't available  ;)
1	@Zerstaubung @ulalaunch @PointyEndUp @SpaceflightNow Sounds good to me.  I like to add a dash of RP1 for a little extra spiceyness
1	@mlelak3 @ulalaunch Thank you
1	@Fingersoup @ExoSpaceHQ @FortuneMagazine Working it
-1	@davidrherron @usairforce Sadly  yes
1	@stromspace definitely hydrogen. I'm all about green ;)
1	@PhilipJLinden @ExoSpaceHQ @FortuneMagazine Kind of a self answering question. Competition is healthy. As long as it is a fair &amp; level field
1	@Zerstaubung @ulalaunch @SpaceflightNow Heaviest  and those with complex orbit insertions involving long coasts and re-ignitions
1	@SullivansProjs @Cosmic_Carol @chriscwharris @NOAA  Mighty Atlas is powerful and uniquely able to operate for many hours in space
1	.@NatReconOfc @airandspace Cool aircraft.  My fluid mechanics Prof worked it and often regaled us with stories
1	@dslsynth Yes  but... Rocky McRocketface will not be allowed ;)
1	@dslsynth Yup
1	@dslsynth Not that I recall  but it was multi-national
1	@KayDesigner @ulalaunch Thank you
-1	@AustinOnSocial He hung out. Snuck in  stole food.Waited under porch every morning to grab Greatgranma's ankle &amp; hear her holler.Mischevious
1	@roach Me too ;)
-1	@AustinOnSocial Poor guy. Had a "pet" raccoon when I was a kid. Hit by a car. Nursed him back to health. Wouldn't leave...
1	@JRascagneres @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Busy time.  Give it a week
1	@roach Shhhhh.....;)
1	@wikkit @rocketrepreneur @lars_0 So I've heard...
1	@JRascagneres @ulalaunch Yes
1	@CJDaniels77 you are the first
1	@KayDesigner yup
1	@JRascagneres @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx send your address to corp comms on our website and I'll send a care pkg
1	@JRascagneres @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Space inspires everyone
1	@stromspace you know it
1	@dslsynth interesting idea
1	@dslsynth easier to make it on earth. Can store LOX LH2 on orbit for several years
1	@themarkashley @johnmknight @LEGOIdeas i figured it out
1	@OrbitalATK @NASA_Wallops Congrats
1	@SRodgerBock @elonmusk Yes  it is
1	@dslsynth Classified;)
1	@dslsynth Already done it ;)
1	@OrbitalATK @NASA Good luck
1	@baserunner0723 @ulalaunch Cool
1	@stevenkwatts @wardniner @OSIRISREx @DSLauretta send his coordinates to corp comms at https://t.co/3i19OWVoKh  we'll send a pkg @ulalaunch
1	@sarahcruddas my favorite city up north. Have fun
1	@Astro_Zach Not the one you're thinking of
1	@OrbitalATK @VCSFA_MARS @NASA_Wallops @NASASocial Fine looking group.  Good hunting
1	@DougonTech Caught it as a UK bird
1	@dougperry2006 I like the way you think
1	@blytheverse @SciGuySpace good eye ;)
1	@BryanKeIIy @MerlinTheEngine @stromspace interesting
1	@the_ss_caleb @ulalaunch Demand fell off
1	@the_ss_caleb @ulalaunch Yes  but near the end. Last launch in a year  year and a half.
1	@AndrewNCassidy @ulalaunch right
1	@baserunner0723 @ulalaunch 422
-1	@baserunner0723 @ulalaunch We routinely exceed classical terminal velocity.  So the speed necessary to destroy would be "Ludicrous Speed" ;)
1	@Hywel95 @ulalaunch @BoeingDefense @NASA not really
1	@dslsynth @george_sowers The lighter gray skirt is new
1	@John_Gardi @BigelowSpace @ulalaunch Bob and I have spent a lot of time together....
1	@dslsynth @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing Getting better. Expect a date to return to ops from USAF soon
1	@NASASpaceflight @CwG_NSF Looking forward to sending this technological wonder on its way
1	@HolsMichael @ulalaunch Timing and also the availability of Mariner
1	@doug_ellison @NASASpaceflight @waynehale Thanks  but I'm just to busy changing the future of space ;)
1	@dslsynth Very unusual situation
1	@thatspacegeek @ulalaunch Yes.  Many evacuated from their homes. Checking on everyone now
1	@captainkirkxc @HolsMichael @ulalaunch thanks
1	@dslsynth We'll assess that over the next few days.  Today was a quick survey. Teams of personnel  quickly fanned out over our facilities
1	@KayDesigner @Astro_Zach @NobbeChristine @NSS_StL @ulalaunch Congrats
1	@dslsynth thanks
1	@WinterBynes The next one (always).
1	@DanPX2 Positioned horizontal (one stand alone vertical Centaur).  Secured.  Building battened down.  Mariner sent to safe waters
1	@dslsynth @ulalaunch @george_sowers @aiaa Thanks
-1	@NzoVito Drop us a line.  Also lots of of Aerospace here in Colorado
1	@LameLefty @Robotbeat Stages at the Cape.  Down and buttoned up tight inside the buildings.  Stages on the Mariner  sent her to safe waters
-1	@sparklefingered  Advice on this one might be a bit above my pay grade.  Really tough situation.  My sympathies
1	@Robotbeat @SurfaceWinds yup
1	@Rocket_AtlasV @ulalaunch Thanks.  Most of our hardware is in the horizontal with facilities buttoned up tight.  Our people evacuated
1	@dslsynth Ooooo  nice
1	@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch of course
1	@SurfaceWinds @Robotbeat Yes  but I'll have no people there to launch it
1	@Robotbeat Atlas/Delta provide very unique capabilities.  Battening down the hatches.  Personnel safety is the first priority
1	@KayDesigner One of my many talents ;)
1	@blueorigin @SpaceflightIns Cool pic
1	@Destructor111 Outdoors
1	@stratohornet USAF assessing when the base to resume flight ops. Hope to have an answer soon
1	@Astro_Zach Jeff is very cool. But also a very humble and serious person
1	@dslsynth yes. Very loud
1	@malderi @Robotbeat working my third cup now
1	@NanoRacks yup. Pretty early. ;)
1	@JohnMcGauley Don't know yet  but we can turn a launch very quickly if weather permits and the base can support
1	@John_Gardi @NatReconOfc I could tell you  but... ;)
1	@johnkrausphotos yes. Very cool. Thank you!
1	@julia_bergeron @ulalaunch kneel down transporter. I don't recognize the piece of tooling @ulalaunch
1	@theWeatherboy we have a set of standard procedures. Not our first rodeo
-1	@KSpaceAcademy controlled explosion  creating a Meg of thrust  fed by 10s of 1000s of hp  in a pkg the size of a fridge... timeless style
1	@KSpaceAcademy Soooo KSP says engines are the mullet of the rocket. Hmmm.  ;)
-1	@HolsMichael @ulalaunch I have no spcl insight into failure investigation. Been trying not acknowledge preposterous third party speculation
1	@ChrisDMarshall @ulalaunch Not yet.  The Western Range is still assessing when they can resume Flight Ops
1	@RealAntonioM @ulalaunch @30thSpaceWing Not yet.  USAF is still assessing when they can return to flight ops
1	@RealAntonioM @ulalaunch @30thSpaceWing USAF still assessing when they can return to flight operations
1	@DanPX2  Better question for SX. I have No special insight into the failure investigation. Safety transcends competition in this industry
1	@Astro_Zach @NASAWatch  @ulalaunch Private companies lease facilities at CCAFS. SMARF is &gt;1 mile from SLC39. We store equipment there
1	@rappolee @ulalaunch @julia_bergeron resend
1	@davidrherron @NASASpaceflight We are the truck.  Others do capsules.  But... Vulcan/ACES is a really big truck...
1	@rappolee @julia_bergeron @ulalaunch expect 11 or 12 in 2017. Starting off with an NSS
1	@Rocket_AtlasV @BoeingDefense 2 solids
1	@NASASpaceflight I'd say the first several hundred
1	@GalileoMoon @ulalaunch Don't know yet
1	@dlandinglegs @prezcannady @DougonTech @elonmusk The great discovery of our time:  Water is everywhere
1	@dlandinglegs I have worked with many competimates over the years when that was needed to make the customer's mission succeed
-1	@BrewCityChaser @GalileoMoon @GrahamBowes @ulalaunch @Cosmic_Carol drop a line to corp communications
1	@sparklefingered Garnet.
1	@dslsynth @freek_dekker So long  and thanks for all the fish  ;)
1	@DougonTech @elonmusk Doing my part. I believe a self-sustaining #CisLunar1000 economy is essential to all other perm off Earth endeavors
1	@NASA_Nerd @ulalaunch congrats. likewise
1	@Cosmic_Carol @ulalaunch cool
1	@GalileoMoon @ulalaunch awesome
1	@Cosmic_Carol @ulalaunch likewise
-1	@richsnod will be retired by ACES. Probably need a better name for that revolutionary capability
1	@davidrherron @Znapel No. Atlas will continue on RD180. Vulcan will fly in 2019 with a BE4 or about a year later if we downselect to AR1
1	@chip_snyder @NASASpaceflight (This is why I have a dog....)
1	@AuerSusan A thing of beauty ;)
1	@romn8tr Exactly
1	@ULAEngineer @ulalaunch We'll see what we can do
1	@Astro_Adept @ASLaunchers @ulalaunch send corp email you address. Tell them I sent you
1	@Astro_Adept @rocketrepreneur Shhhh....
1	@Rocket_AtlasV @ulalaunch me too
1	@LPLobinske We do.  @ulalaunch  How can we make that happen?
1	@RuthFieldBeck1 Likewise
1	@dslsynth Yes.  31 years this November
-1	@omcintyre @ulalaunch @Crow_T_Robot Very sad news
-1	@wardniner @ulalaunch @EPN473 @VCFD Very sad news indeed
1	@AustinOnSocial https://t.co/RnOUTXORpX
1	@stratohornet Also appears safe at present
1	@lexcalibur100 @legoclone09 yes
1	@legoclone09 @KSpaceAcademy Too busy launching rockets and changing the future of space
1	@aWildLupiDragon IDK. @ulalaunch
1	@joaosg @legoclone09 sure. Email us on the website
1	@dslsynth Detanked after prior attempt.  Interesting idea  but not really practical starting from this point.
1	@dslsynth Mostly.  The ISS Cargo InfoG touched on RAAN Steering
1	@JohnMcGauley Dedicated teams with common engineering support in Centennial
1	@SLC4_LZ2 @DragonWindow @ulalaunch Over 600 firefighters are working this fire as hard as they can
1	@DragonWindow @ulalaunch Thanks. Done everything we can. Buttoned her up tight. Back in the MSP. Clean atmo with positive pressure  etc
1	@DragonWindow @ulalaunch depends on how much time we'd have
1	@kycutter2914 @ulalaunch @Crow_T_Robot @ChrisDMarshall @SecAF23 Don't know yet
1	@legoclone09 go to our website.  email corp comms.  Tell them I sent you
-1	@A_M_Swallow @TrampolinRocket @ChrisDMarshall @ulalaunch Alas  no
1	@TFDeaconTAZ @SpaceHedge @ulalaunch @elonmusk you might want to visit our Youtube channel and check out some of the Vulcan rocket vids
1	@ChrisDMarshall @Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch  thanks
1	@Crow_T_Robot @ChrisDMarshall @SecAF23 @ulalaunch I feel well protected by the outstanding USAF Operations and Firefighting teams
1	@ChrisDMarshall @ulalaunch closer than I would like. Birds secure. Firefighters ready if needed. Launch date still good
1	@ACosmicObserver @ulalaunch Bird and S/C are secured.  USAF firefighters have resources nearby should they be needed.
1	@John_Gardi yes. We have a USG launch from VAFB before the end of the year
1	@dslsynth @ulalaunch Always
1	@baserunner0723 tower designs provide lots of access and commodities  while giving lift off clearance
-1	@John_Gardi not like an interplanetary. Windows governed by pad and base operations
1	@RocketmanJRS @ulalaunch @30thSpaceWing thanks
1	@johnkrausphotos @ulalaunch nice
-1	@astro_navis @ulalaunch Unfortunately  there is a wildfire interfering with operations.  Keep an eye on the news reports
1	@mymultipass Dilithium crystal misalignment ;)
-1	@dslsynth The very definition of irony.  But... WV will be able to see you ;)
1	@tehWKD 1 hr  24 minutes from now
1	@taliaeliana @GoZeroG Good luck
1	@AustinOnSocial Almost as exciting as launching #WorldView4
1	@wardniner It will get much more exciting in about an hour and 37 minutes
1	@DavidBflower thanks
1	@AustinOnSocial Yes
-1	@Screpheep @ulalaunch Because #OSIRISREx is on an interplanetary trajectory  so is Centaur.  This makes escape the most efficient disposal
1	@chrisadams2112 bit heavy for us
1	@chrisadams2112 not really our mission
1	@katrobison @ulalaunch interesting question. Reach iut to jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch with that one
1	@adolfgatonegro @OSIRISREx Thanks
1	@John_Gardi @BlairBigelow @JeffBezos Well said
1	@Astro_Zach @elonmusk I did...
1	@AnnaDotBlue @wardniner @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch @UofA @SpaceflightIns That too ;)
1	@RealAntonioM @NASASocial @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch @NASAKennedy @ExploreSpaceKSC Send us a note in the website.  I'll send you some swag
1	@legoclone09 Always ;)
1	@sparklefingered you are very welcome. Cool art
1	@WinterBynes @Astro_Zach @blueorigin absolutely
1	@HolsMichael @ulalaunch Its coming
1	@Tschnn @IAC2016 @ulalaunch Not this time
1	@wardniner @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch @UofA @SpaceflightIns We could not do our job without the amazing support of the USAF and KSC
1	@DougonTech @On2Space @ulalaunch I kind of like the idea of one-click space launch ordering ;)
1	@HolsMichael @ulalaunch yup
1	@HolsMichael @ulalaunch mail it to our offices in Centennial
1	@spaceloss @LocutusF @elonmusk No truer words...
1	@BostonSpaceOrg @ulalaunch @NOAA Keep an eye our our feed.  We'll keep the Pgo current (it's usually about the weather)
1	@johnkrausphotos @ulalaunch Just hit the "contact ULA" on the website.  Tell them I sent you
1	@Astro_Zach @blueorigin Good luck!
-1	@NASASpaceflight Darn.  Missed it. No longer up.  If Kayne really wants to go to space  we've got his ride ;)
1	@Astro_Zach @GalileoMoon @JPMajor likewise
1	@johnkrausphotos Must be pretty old.  Send @ulalaunch your address  and we'll send you some better posters
1	@dslsynth practice.
1	@JPMajor @AstroAnarchy likewise
1	@wardniner @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch @NASA quite the artist
1	@marsbeyond @rocketrepreneur @LarsTheWanderer @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch among other things...
-1	@rappolee Drop my PAO a line.  Jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com
1	@legoclone09 @OSIRISREx cool
1	@rappolee Idk yet
1	@ARJules @LarsTheWanderer @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch sounds just about right to me
1	@HipeRFin @DJSnM @ulalaunch cool idea  @ulalaunch
1	@FuturamaKing @DJSnM @planet4589 @OSIRISREx yup. Only needed one. Booster Control authority can handle it
-1	@dslsynth @OSIRISREx Typically spend every last usable drop to optimize orbit  then vent the little that won't feed into the engine
1	@aWildLupiDragon @ulalaunch thanks
1	@dslsynth Will do
1	@FuturamaKing @DJSnM @planet4589 @OSIRISREx Only needed one. It is asymmetric. Booster has enough control authority to cope
1	@HolsMichael @ulalaunch All things are possible in space
1	@dslsynth Coll idea.  @ulalaunch   please see what we can do
1	@wardniner @ulalaunch thanks
1	@DSLauretta thanks.  You and @OSIRISREx are official part of the family #ToBennuAndBack
1	@Crow_T_Robot @DJSnM @ulalaunch we are very active
1	@DJSnM @ulalaunch cool
1	@prezcannady Lrg constlns will sometimes build a spare S/C. Sometimes placed in orbit. Most are 1 of a kind  so spare parts during mfg only
1	@SenShelby @ulalaunch Thanks
1	@Crow_T_Robot good
1	@ScottishRobot Ask @ulalaunch
1	@KasperVld Approaching 400 flights.  Butterflies every time
1	@dslsynth @OSIRISREx Orbits the sun
1	@tylerjackoliver @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Real time flight profile updates to account for the rotation of the earth relative to the target
1	@PCDPhotography @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx thanks
1	@baserunner0723 Tower is designed and positioned to be safe during launch
1	@LEOMarohl @ulalaunch thanks
1	@Luke_Macchione @ulalaunch That was more about automatic inflight retargeting that allowed Centaur to compensate
1	@Luke_Macchione @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Standard capability which is especially useful for rendezvous missions (ISS Cargo  Asteroids  etc)
1	@Astro_Zach will do
1	@Astro_Zach yup
1	@HolsMichael @ulalaunch thanks
1	@cartee21 @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx thanks
1	@jeffreypmyers @ulalaunch thanks
1	@Cosmic_Carol @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx thanks
1	@dslsynth yup
1	@Cardoso yes
1	@KayDesigner thanks
1	@murphypak @baserunner0723 likewise
1	@ds_zimmerman @JPMajor @ulalaunch see me on the weekend ;)
1	@JRascagneres @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx @ej_sa the perfect attire for a trip #ToBennuAndBack
1	@JRascagneres Right
1	@JRascagneres yes
1	@LocutusF @John_Gardi That's why I now save on barber expenses ;)
1	@John_Gardi @LocutusF For this mission  it will stay in the stowed position.  Don't recall OTTOMH for a crewed mission @ulalaunch
1	@LocutusF @John_Gardi yes
1	@RITSPEX @OSIRISREx thanks
1	@JRascagneres The boosters are interchangeable. One of the ways we seamlessly accommodate late satellites or changing customer priorities
1	@thePancakeBot @CalPoly Cool
1	@JPMajor @Mike_Seeley @ulalaunch @NASAKennedy @WeAreGoFL @45thSpaceWing nice
1	@ponder68 @KayDesigner @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Luck has nothing to do with it.... But I'll take all I can get
1	Mr. @DSLauretta   Your Uber Driver to Space will be waiting for you at SLC41 ;) https://t.co/oPNxS1ntOp
1	@KayDesigner @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Yup  this will be 111
1	@dslsynth Cape
1	@jasonrdavis @tanyaofmars You know it!
1	@NzoVito @elonmusk I always do
-1	@kmccoy my ears are burning. On my way now
-1	Alas no. As far as we know  Spike is still performing his duty @NatReconOfc  https://t.co/pthnuOlf3Y
1	@Kalti @ulalaunch no. Yes. Yes
1	@Itzalpean @SpaceHedge more or less with a new RAAN solution every 5 min for 2 hours
1	@chitownchica @ulalaunch @RadarDude We've never hosted a wedding in the VIF before.... ;)
1	@joebarnard @OSIRISREx Thanks
1	@ulalaunch Send us an address and we'll send you some engagement swag https://t.co/d7nLnjfcyo
1	@KayDesigner Mighty Atlas playing Cupid.  This could be a first  :)
1	@NatReconOfc @DeptofDefense @CIA Happy birthday
1	@AustinOnSocial @LauraKeeney @ulalaunch Thanks
1	@Stian_Nuland @ulalaunch Atlas Five.
1	@RocketmanJRS I've followed you.  Feel free to DM me
1	@dolostone @OSIRISREx Me too.  Send your address to our corp email and @ulalaunch will send you some goodies for your students
1	@cebri1 @spacecom @SpaceflightNow thanks
1	@Astronaut_Ben @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch Pgo = 70% for weather
1	@SamueleZannoni @DSLauretta Thanks
1	@dslsynth related to the recent event
1	@docdailey congrats
1	@Jack_Frodo @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch definitely
1	@sparklefingered @621Lynn @ulalaunch @OSIRISREx Insanely cool ;)
1	@docdailey @SpaceflightIns @OSIRISREx Me too
1	@RuthFieldBeck1 @SpaceflightIns @OSIRISREx Have fun
1	@DSLauretta @OSIRISREx We are here for you
1	@snowwrestler @ulalaunch just relieved. If we lost our window  it would be another year before we could go to Bennu
1	@ChrisDMarshall @rocketrepreneur @pbdes @ulalaunch yup. Worldview and Echostar this year
1	@realKyleOlbert good question for @Boeing and @NASA_SLS
1	@Astro_Zach Root cause investigation  robust corrective action  return to flight
1	.@dslsynth @OSIRISREx So far  so good. Unique ability to optimize and reprogram trajectory up to launch and adjust in flight: Lots of margin
1	@WinterBynes Thanks.  My heart goes out to the SpaceX team.
-1	@Xavalliger I never joke about this.  Too much heart and soul goes into building a rocket
1	.@ScottishRobot @OSIRISREx  Our personnel were evacuated from SLC41. All are accounted for and unharmed.  Hope to return later today.
1	@KayDesigner No
1	@SPACEdotcom @StarTrek Kirk
1	@genejm29 thanks
1	@DougonTech yup
-1	@KasperVld Sorry no.  You've got to work the mission to get one
1	@NASASpaceflight Thinking about doing a 360 deg virtual factory tour...
1	@taliaeliana looks like you had quite a summer!
1	@AllStuffSpace @ulalaunch NASA requires this extra surety for interplanetary missions
-1	@DatKraken @ulalaunch ACES will capture the boil off propellants and recycle them through an IC engine to depressurize the tanks
1	@DatKraken @dslsynth @ulalaunch The engine downselect for ACES has not yet been made
1	@sparklefingered me too
1	@julia_bergeron @ulalaunch Thanks
-1	@collinkrum @TimFernholz @ulalaunch I've been called worse ;)
1	@polyman71 @John_Gardi @wingod No
-1	@DutraWeather @ulalaunch Drop jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com a line
1	@SpaceBrendan Shhh...
1	@AndrewNCassidy I'm pretty sure we would set some kind of record ;)
-1	@Crow_T_Robot Drop my PA a line.  Jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com
1	@KasperVld Artistic license
1	@jsalsman @NASASpaceflight Details of how we handle weather are significantly more sophisticated than other providers and proprietary
1	@cesarparent @johnkrausphotos just part of the flight profile
1	@AstroAllie5 thanks
1	@Pandersonpllc @ulalaunch cool
1	@Sass_tronaut @ulalaunch cool
1	@stoutde I like the way you think
1	@RocketmanJRS @Astro_Zach @OSIRISREx Thanks
1	@alexsturgill @ulalaunch @NASA_go4launch @NASAKennedy Thanks
1	@stromspace Whatever it takes ;)
1	@MikeKarnes54 @ulalaunch Send me a pic
1	@dlandinglegs @ulalaunch @Boeing Thanks
1	@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch You are here in spirit
1	@DragonWindow @ExploreSpaceKSC @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @AFSpace Probably because its a DeltaIV
1	@John_Gardi Time will tell
1	@KayDesigner My son
1	@SpaceKSCBlog @ulalaunch @BoeingDefense ULA owns it
1	@DragonWindow Its a DeltaIV M+4 2
1	@arattari @Military_Flight @45thSpaceWing @ulalaunch has to do with type and location
1	@dslsynth On-going event before this.  No  not presently planned
1	@Astro_Adept @FuturamaKing Going as fast as possible...
1	.@FuturamaKing Opened with rapid Atlas Launch  then my son hit me with Gov Shutdown Card. Froze me out until he caught up and won. #Xtronaut
1	@dslsynth You know it. ;)
1	@dslsynth not yet
-1	@Astro_Adept Live dangerously ;)
1	@AstronautAbby @Wellesley Looks like a really cool experience
1	@murphypak @OSIRISREx @NASAKennedy @ulalaunch The Delta Mariner
1	@Cardoso I like the way you think
1	@pilliarscreatio LOX transfer line on the right.  Avionics pod on the left
1	@Astro_Adept @DSLauretta @KayDesigner @OSIRISREx @NASAKennedy @ulalaunch @CapeCanaveralFL Barges are towed...
1	@Cardoso Right.  Mariner has a crew
1	@murphypak  @OSIRISREx @NASAKennedy @ulalaunch IDKOTOMH  But I'd guess Mariner is on her way back for the next bird.  Flying 8x before XMAS
1	@ULALunch @OSIRISREx You know it ;)
1	@John_Gardi Yes
1	@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch Always
1	@John_Gardi @Stian_Nuland @ulalaunch Looks like a Vulcan/Centaur with a single RL10
1	@SpaceVR @SpaceflightIns @SpaceX Looking good there Gwynne
1	@Macc21st @Stratocumulus Of course ;)
1	.@DSLauretta @kickstarter My pleasure
1	@sparklefingered @KerbalSpaceP I've found that a dash of RP1 in your tea gives it an extra zing ;)
1	@legoclone09 @KerbalSpaceP cool
1	@legoclone09 @KerbalSpaceP Not yet
1	@dslsynth No.  He sniffed around and moved on.
1	@TheHypaaa @KerbalSpaceP @ulalaunch No spoilers.  Watch this space...
1	@dslsynth Black bear in my yard 2 weeks ago...
1	@AiDeeAi Amazon
1	@crocodilekatie IDK. Got mine as a thank you for contributing to their kickstarter
1	@CalinWay @matthiascarter @OSIRISREx yes. Compensates for SRB moment
1	@CalinWay @AndrewNCassidy yup. LOX feed line and avionics pod take up a position
1	@AndrewNCassidy Just what the mission demands
1	@Crow_T_Robot Easy Command
1	@KayDesigner @DSLauretta @OSIRISREx @NASAKennedy @ulalaunch Ship
1	@shanemuk @NASASpaceflight I do
1	@NASASpaceflight I like the way you think
1	@tanyaofmars @westernuCPSX Very  very cool
1	@teamvelociposse @DSLauretta @NASAKennedy @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch IDK.  What do you have in mind?
1	@astro_amanda @tanyaofmars Beautiful
1	@murphypak @NASASpaceflight No
1	@Astro_Zach Likewise
1	@stromspace good one
1	@sparklefingered @NASA the music of launch :)
1	@lorengrush nothing happened ;)
1	@Stratocumulus @Pandersonpllc @ulalaunch @SpaceflightIns @SpaceflightNow Nice shot
1	@dslsynth @VeroMortensen @carlmorner thanks. That hit the spot
1	@julia_bergeron @The_Jay_Bo Please make it happen @ulalaunch
1	@dslsynth great idea
1	@Mausonaut @NASA_SLS @MoonDotStation Nice
1	@Sherlock_NZ @OSIRISREx Awesome. Welcome
1	@WinterBynes not yet. Sounds cool
1	@chip_snyder @NASAWatch 109
1	@Stratocumulus @SpaceKSCBlog @ulalaunch nice
1	@WinterBynes looks ok to me
1	@chip_snyder @NASAWatch We don't talk about NRO Club
1	@sparklefingered @usa_satcom intersting hobby from a technical aspect but I imagine the sat's conversation skills might be lacking  ;)
1	@malderi @Astro_Zach @blueorigin I know those guys...
1	@omcintyre @ulalaunch @NatReconOfc thanks
1	@OSIRISREx @ulalaunch @NatReconOfc @45thSpaceWing @AFSpace @AF_SMC @usairforce Can't wait
1	@BP_Hutch @ulalaunch thanks
1	@KSpaceAcademy @twuelfing @DefenseOne @ToddHarrisonDC Yeeha
1	@John_Gardi 109
1	@John_Gardi We wait for NRO to speak first
1	@NASAWatch We don't talk about NRO Club ;)
1	@dslsynth @VGChiefTrainer @ulalaunch No
1	@WeHaveMECO I meant it NEVER gets old
1	@VGChiefTrainer Soon  but no.  We are approaching the part where we don't talk about NRO Club
-1	@dslsynth Ludicrous Speed
1	@Cosmic_Carol @ulalaunch Thanks
1	@SpaceBrendan @ulalaunch Our pleasure.  Be back in a couple weeks...
1	@julia_bergeron @John_Gardi Good spot
1	@Astro_Zach yup
1	.@taliaeliana @VirginAmerica Cool.  Send me a pic if you do
1	@pilliarscreatio @WeAreGoFL Don't get your laptop wet ;)
1	@pixelastronaut @ulalaunch Convention is to call the in line boosters stages and the external SRBs Strap on Solids
1	@dslsynth Pumps
1	@rappolee Me too
1	@rappolee Cool
1	@rappolee Youtube
1	@dslsynth Starting soon
1	@Astro_Zach Thanks
1	@taliaeliana @VirginAmerica Bummer
1	@crocodilekatie Thanks
1	@Cosmic_Carol @PaulDalyROI 0830 eastern
1	@poniosun thanks
1	@KayDesigner 109
1	@AndrewMunsell97 @ulalaunch @NatReconOfc Thanks
1	@Gomerick_Enghor @ulalaunch solids  (The Really big Estes...)
1	@John_Gardi We don't talk about NRO Club  ;)
1	@dtarsgeorge @John_Gardi @spacecom @b0yle @SciGuySpace @SpaceKSCBlog @jeff_foust @fcain Ok.  Speed records  EXCLUDING the Flash  ;)
1	@spodgemonkey @DrPhiltill Yup :)   (but... we also flew Genesis the same day  an Atlas/CST100 model a week earlier at the Cape  and others)
1	@AllStuffSpace @ulalaunch thanks
1	@jabe8 yes
1	@dlandinglegs @FalconGridFin @SpaceX @NASA @ulalaunch @elonmusk Also good  but the acronym is taken  Lockheed Launch Vehicle.  Solids based
1	@FalconGridFin @SpaceX @NASA @ulalaunch @elonmusk Sounds right to me ;)
1	@baserunner0723 @SpaceX @elonmusk @ulalaunch @ExploreSpaceKSC That one on the left looks pretty cool  ;)
1	@dslsynth Advice to love by
1	@johnkrausphotos @NatGeo Nice pics
1	@John_Gardi @JeffBezos @trailingjohnson I'm not bald. I'm just aerodynamic ;)
1	@dslsynth @ulalaunch Fun.  Great bunch of space enthusiasts
1	Heading over to the Denver Economic Council this morning to talk about @ulalaunch and Spaaaace
1	@We_Martians Not a lot of research on that.... ;)
1	@ChrisDMarshall Sure ;)
1	@KayDesigner Looks like almost too much fun
1	@ulalaunch Volunteers had a great day with kids at OpenWorld Learning's summer camp.Future rocket scientists  #STEM https://t.co/qBTleT788K
1	@dslsynth if you mean the hydrocarbon first stage  probably not
1	@romn8tr Thanks
1	@MissAerospace @dkeister_ Cheering them on ;)
1	@DatKraken @ulalaunch If you assume 10% length increases  close enough for now. Centaur remains the same.Have not chosen engine for ACES yet
1	@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch Thanks
1	@DatKraken What can we provide @ulalaunch ?
1	@jabe8 prior to my time at ULA. Mostly small talk. One of the nicest people I've ever met
1	@Astro_Zach @DalaiLama I've never had my picture taken with Zach
1	@dslsynth few years ago. He was traveling from meeting with POTUS to San Francisco
1	@jabe8 longish. DC to SFO
1	@Pat_DefDaily @DougonTech 2017
1	@Pat_DefDaily @DougonTech Not yet. Have not finalized pricing
1	@DougonTech We plan to offer Vulcan/Centaur in 2017 for a first flight in late 2019. Getting inquiries now
1	@ulalaunch @Qubits_Toy Can I guess?
1	@Astro_Zach @ChipotleTweets @ulalaunch Happy Birthday  Zach
1	@Simberg_Space @AaronMehta I am aware.  140 does not allow for detailed explanations...
1	@DragonWindow @ulalaunch @astrosociety You might be just a little short ;)
1	@dslsynth @ulalaunch @CopSub PLEASE DO NOT STAND BENEATH DURING LAUNCH.  ;)
1	@John_Gardi 0830
1	@dslsynth Thanks
1	@amzeratul @johnkrausphotos @ulalaunch @USNavy cool
1	@JoleneGiroux1 @ulalaunch @OrbitalATK thanks
1	@John_Gardi I'm on this morning at 0830
1	@Astro_Zach watch the videos on our internal knowledge transfer site. You'll feel like an expert in no time
-1	@Simberg_Space sorry no
1	@John_Gardi just flew in
1	@johnjmin Whats the answer @ulalaunch ?
1	@Astro_Zach @dslsynth imperial
1	@AntonioParis @Astro_Zach nice pic
1	@dslsynth @Astro_Zach a lot
1	@dslsynth @ulalaunch @CopSub perfect flight  but a rough night's sleep
1	@Astro_Zach @dslsynth that Atlas super heavy would have been a thing to behold...
1	@dslsynth @ulalaunch @CopSub Cool. I've launch a few from sea. First time  I had to sleep on a torpedo
1	@dslsynth 5 core...  Sounds cool ;)
1	@NASA_go4launch cool pic
1	@Fingersoup IDK.  What's the answer @ulalaunch ?
-1	@collinkrum @thedrive @ulalaunch Thanks.  Been called worse ;)
1	@JRascagneres @OSIRISREx @ulalaunch ok
1	@dslsynth @ben_nuttall @github Different compiler or OS issue?
1	@NinjaEconomics @Robotbeat Intern positions at @ulalaunch are paid
1	@JRascagneres @ulalaunch Because Blue Origin was already 3 years in.
1	@fcain @storybywill Because Juliet is the sun (Or astrophysics...;)
1	@KayDesigner @LastManOnMoon Working on it
1	@aiaa @PopSci Likely
1	@murphypak @rappolee @GetSiQSteve @emilylmullin The feeling is mutual ;)
1	@MatthewPinegar Several Space companies.  Especially the bigger companies use all sorts of skills. And/or think about adding another degree
1	@nextspaceflight @WinterBynes @ulalaunch I agree.  @ulalaunch please have the swag master send a care package with my compliments
1	@SP_JohnSullivan @ulalaunch @evankirstel @batchelorshow @SPACEdotcom I like the sound of that ;)
1	@omcintyre @NASAJuno Beautiful
-1	@fs10inator @ulalaunch Alas  still earth bound  ;)
1	@HurwitzSam @zlsadesign @ulalaunch Yes
1	@rappolee @planet4589 It is a moving experience
1	@MorwicSound @AstronautAbby soon ()
1	@dslsynth not nearly enough ;)
1	@marcosantana Give my PA a call. Jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com
1	Thanks @AstronautAbby #marsgeneration https://t.co/beKRATyhA3
1	@thomassturm @Astro_Zach @ZeroGravityKyle yup
1	@KayDesigner they call it a seeder
1	@KSpaceAcademy @farmingsim @mikeroweworks great idea
1	@dslsynth super cool  but kind of creepy...
1	@John_Gardi not yet
1	@John_Gardi Now you're talking...
1	@AusAndgie7 @rocketrepreneur @Terubou_Cos bottom row. Second from the left
1	@tanyaofmars You win ;)
1	@thefrownyface @ulalaunch likely
1	@thefrownyface @ulalaunch one of my favorite missions
1	@thefrownyface what's the answer @ulalaunch ?
1	@aleroi 2/2 along with certifying that the rocket will be compatible and work in concert with those systems
1	@aleroi a human rated system adds a crew escape system and different criteria for mission abort. All that gets its own certification
1	@tanyaofmars I know what you mean... https://t.co/wi7icAXHq9
1	@FalconGridFin @ulalaunch yes
1	@stromspace ;)
1	@FalconGridFin @ulalaunch yes
1	@FalconGridFin @ulalaunch yes
1	@dslsynth @nextspaceflight @ulalaunch cuts out quickly so we can devote our bandwidth to the active stage
1	@AidanShaffer @NASASpaceflight @george_sowers for parts
-1	@AidanShaffer @NASASpaceflight @george_sowers Yes  but for this type of mission its generally placed in the designated disposal orbit
1	@WeAreGoFL @Astro_Zach @ulalaunch thanks
1	@romn8tr @cmcichon yup
1	@chemistrybiker cool
1	@tehWKD @ulalaunch Good question for @LockheedMartin
1	@JRascagneres custom GTO to extend sat life
1	Solution number 2. #howfastula. @ulalaunch  https://t.co/nDjNZk0IGL
1	@JRascagneres Enhanced GTO. We like going direct inject GSO  but MUOS is a big boy at 7.5 tons
1	@atubbs @Astro_Zach @ulalaunch thanks
1	First solution in. Mark with #howfastula. @ulalaunch  https://t.co/L72OT4NZ8f
1	@spacepat_o How big is space
1	@DanSpace77 @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @AerojetRdyne @LockheedMartin @USNavy Any time
1	@littlebird321 @DanSpace77 nice pic
1	@LauraForczyk @ulalaunch thanks.
1	@eleventeen @SpaceKSCBlog @ulalaunch how can you not be watching the live feed?  ;)
1	@nite97m we'll take a look @ulalaunch
1	@VAXHeadroom @ulalaunch Oh yea!
1	@romn8tr great physics problem. Rd180 at 860klbf + 5 srbs at 380klbf ea.  Rest to 206 ft. Swag to the best answer
1	.@baserunner0723 knowledge  passion and poise
1	@HolsMichael @ulalaunch I won't tell. ;)
1	@DutraWeather @ulalaunch All good. 80% go for weather
1	@FrancescoNicoli good guess  but no. It was space enthusiast Prince Edward
1	@Astro_Zach Canada
1	@SP_JohnSullivan @SpaceflightNow @robertbrand @ulalaunch My sentiment exactly
1	@Astro_Zach yes  Earl of Wessex
1	@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch We could name it something other than ACES.  What do you think?
1	@Astro_Zach Next time
1	@Astro_Zach Wow
1	@FrancescoNicoli Great guess  but no
1	@jaredhead absolutely
1	@richardadenot @NASASpaceflight Thrust vectoring
1	@romn8tr @rocketrepreneur @NASASpaceflight @HolsMichael Very funny. Thanks for the chuckle
1	@NASASpaceflight @HolsMichael hilarious
1	@WHEbe60165 @Koln @DrPhiltill @NewHorizons2015 of course!
1	@FrancescoNicoli Cool tech. Still aways off
1	.@dslsynth Beta run for us. Feedback will be helpful
1	@Robotbeat me too
-1	@AstroAllie5 Alas  no. Maybe next time
1	@romn8tr "Rocket Carbs":  kerosene and LOX
1	@romn8tr @AstroAnarchy You got it. What's on the stereo?
1	@thind_navdeep @OrbitalATK @NASA the Majestic 3 core DeltaIV-Heavy is about 20% more performance than AtlasV-551.
1	@romn8tr @SpcPlcyOnline Cool rocket: Mighty Atlas. Cool sat: #MUOS. Puts smart phone capabilities in the hands of our service men and women
1	@romn8tr @SpcPlcyOnline Always
1	@Lisaiz2 @ExploreSpaceKSC @ulalaunch @Astronaut_Joey Clearly a future Rocket scientist
1	@tanyaofmars Had it...
1	@ExploreSpaceKSC @ulalaunch @Lisaiz2 @Astronaut_Joey me too
1	@dslsynth @ulalaunch beta version coming
1	@Astro_Zach We are a very friendly community of rocket scientists
1	@SpaceflightIns ICPS is a ULA product
1	@dslsynth nit off the top of my head. What's the answer @ulalaunch ?
1	@Lisaiz2 @Astronaut_Joey What's the answer @ulalaunch ?
1	@tlaustin @jeff_foust that shiny done is a thing to behold ;)
1	@zerosixbravo @Astro_Zach  working it
1	@lexcalibur100 @BP_Hutch Very Cool
-1	@Crow_T_Robot unfortunately  I will likely be on travel
1	@John_Gardi LOX/LH2.  Need that high performance Cryo for ACES unique capabilities
1	@John_Gardi @blueorigin BE3U  an upper stage variant of BE3  is one of the three engines we are evaluating for ACES
1	.@Astro_Zach @blueorigin There's a long line ;)
1	@dslsynth yup
1	@colindoughan @romn8tr @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos Wish I knew
1	@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch working on stars and stripes  but without any weight....
1	Me too. The team is working on it @ulalaunch  https://t.co/OWHUtgAbCY
1	@sms822 ok. I'll bare that in mind @ulalaunch
1	We'll be pointing them to it on youtube. Great idea @ulalaunch  https://t.co/XADotleI19
1	@jabe8 @JRascagneres @SpaceX it is  so far
1	@HolsMichael @ulalaunch Working on a clever way do do that (ice issues)
1	@dslsynth Cool.  This might call for a Vacuum Bell Channel ;)
-1	.@Astro_Zach @romn8tr @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos kind of unique. A Challenge coin with a hole burned through it by the event  it commemorates
1	@Astro_Zach @romn8tr @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos first light on a 15kw laser I developed in my old job
1	.@Astro_Zach you know me so well
1	@romn8tr @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos I like it. I have a glass conference table that rests on a segment of tank isogrid...
1	@omcintyre @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos Only one way to find out ;)
1	@romn8tr @BelovedRevol @JeffBezos Great idea
1	@Astro_Zach @DiscoverMag We use a couple handy ones NASA has
1	@zlsadesign @ulalaunch yes
1	@nujoud @NASA_Orion Where's the Doctor when we need him?  ;)
1	@TrampolinRocket @The_Jay_Bo @rocketrepreneur vulcan ACES will be about 25% of a D-HVY and do more
1	@Astro_Zach Never. (On my way back from DC)
1	@KayDesigner @NASA_Orion i like the image
1	@dtarsgeorge @Simberg_Space @LameLefty @Robotbeat @rocketrepreneur lagavulin on the rocks. ;)
1	.@dtarsgeorge @Simberg_Space @LameLefty @Robotbeat @rocketrepreneur Looking at 11 missions in the next 7 months (incl last Saturday's)
1	@Danovate @ulalaunch aok
-1	@LameLefty @Robotbeat @rocketrepreneur Root cause isolated. Corrective actions underway
1	@rocketrepreneur @Robotbeat That is correct
1	@KayDesigner @NASA_Orion cool
1	@jasonrdavis @exploreplanets excellent judgement
1	@SP_JohnSullivan @astro_tim @Space_Station @ulalaunch @OrbitalATK @NASA_Wallops yes i do
1	@rappolee Love Joan Baez :)
1	@SpaceHolgar @NASA_SLS Congratulations!
1	@Mausonaut @SpaceHolgar @TheMarsGen @NASA_SLS good luck
1	@marzipandancer @ulalaunch thanks.
1	@KerbalFax @ulalaunch cool
1	@johnkrausphotos thanks. I'll pass that to the team
1	@zlsadesign @bencredible @orbitalpodcast @ulalaunch cool
1	@ShuttleAlmanac @ZeroGravityKyle @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @NatReconOfc very cool
1	@ShuttleAlmanac @ZeroGravityKyle @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @NatReconOfc
1	@ArTaqs @ulalaunch @AerojetRdyne @KSpaceAcademy @ej_sa aero and trajectory
1	@ArTaqs @ulalaunch @AerojetRdyne @KSpaceAcademy yes
1	@HolsMichael @ulalaunch yes
1	@ponder68 @TONDTGR @jkelly3rd @ulalaunch 107
1	@FrancescoNicoli yes
1	@Mike_Seeley @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @WeReportSpace @yourtake nice pic
1	@DeniseSaiki @ulalaunch @NatReconOfc Thanks  D
1	@TobiasVdb @Koln @ulalaunch We dont talk about NRO Club
1	@arsenal3185 @ulalaunch thanks
1	@beeberunner @ulalaunch yes. We actually stagger the start to make it a little less dramatic
1	@ZeroGravityKyle @John_Gardi Forgiven
1	@baserunner0723 @ulalaunch weight. Ie: light payload going to a high orbit will have lots of SRMs and leap off the pad
1	@John_Gardi you are now my favorite weatherman
1	@evanbd @wikkit dont know off the top of my head. Maybe @ulalaunch can find out
1	.@BP_Hutch @AstroAnarchy It is the ultimate "reality show"
1	@johnkrausphotos Easy there  Cowboy.  Gotta get this payload to orbit...
1	@baserunner0723 yes.  And the fence is blown over
1	@aaronraimist Live feed on https://t.co/mZR0Tag7t6
1	@spacepat_o Improving towards green
1	@Cardoso Copy that
1	@KasperVld Roger
1	@AstroAnarchy @lexcalibur100 @omcintyre @SpaceflightIns @ulalaunch How did you guess?  ;)
-1	@omcintyre @lexcalibur100 @AstroAnarchy @SpaceflightIns @ulalaunch Can't say without violating copyright ;)
1	@lexcalibur100 @omcintyre @AstroAnarchy @SpaceflightIns @ulalaunch I'm humming to myself right now
1	@lexcalibur100 @omcintyre @AstroAnarchy @SpaceflightIns @ulalaunch Yes  we do
1	@dslsynth Cryogenic and caffeinated propellants topped off
1	@Astro_Zach I'd come on down  if I were you
-1	@John_R_Maun @NASASpaceflight I'm afraid that rocketry is both the most scientifically intensive AND superstitious activity I've encountered
1	@astronaut_luke @ulalaunch will do
1	@DanCMos Think positive thoughts
1	@Astro_Zach Have your running shoes ready
1	@BackwardsRewind @ulalaunch Less than an hour
1	@JoleneGiroux1 A little
1	@astronaut_luke @ulalaunch I prefer out Mission Success rate
1	@jwarner127 @ulalaunch Less than an hour
1	@KSpaceAcademy @ulalaunch Absolutely
1	@TheBlacktom @SpaceflightIns Yes  Greater than zero
1	@JoleneGiroux1 Better
-1	@marcosantana That's how it came over the net...  Not hopeful  but acknowledging the fickle possibilities presented by the weather gods...
1	.@Astro_Zach Yes.  But always better to be sitting on the ground wishing you were in the air than the other way around...
1	@marcosantana Yup.  Small  but not zero
1	@MrArron4 @ulalaunch No
1	@KasperVld @spacepat_o @KSpaceAcademy If you could guarantee it...;)
1	@spacepat_o @KSpaceAcademy @KasperVld Make me an offer ;)
1	@KasperVld How'd you guess ;)
1	@KasperVld If only
1	@dslsynth Always true
1	@usmc4o66 @ulalaunch @KSpaceAcademy Don't recall off the top of my head  but not insignificant.  That's why we top off until the last moment
1	@thind_navdeep @Mike_Seeley @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @yourtake The weather is not being very supportive of our schedule...
1	@ArTaqs @ulalaunch @AerojetRdyne @KSpaceAcademy Less than you might think
1	@John_Gardi Luck has nothing to do with it ... But I'll take all I can get
1	@Mike_Seeley @ulalaunch @45thSpaceWing @yourtake Me too
1	@MrArron4 We'll take a look @ulalaunch
1	@John_Gardi Yup
1	@_spacehorizons @ulalaunch every cloud
1	@John_Gardi Weather team is forecasting a potential hole in the storms near the window.  Fingers crossed
-1	@CompositesReid @ulalaunch We typically hang in until the end.  Have literally launched before on the last second of a window
1	@dslsynth I like the way you think
1	@Fingersoup @ulalaunch Not so good
1	@johnkrausphotos @ulalaunch Everybody think Clear  sunny skies...
-1	@dslsynth @renpytom We monitor strikes  strike type and cloud type
1	@dslsynth @Astro_Zach yes
1	@dslsynth Yes.  Root cause understood.  Corrective actions underway. I expect all missions completing within the year
-1	@DougonTech That was a repost from me.  And  yes  launches always make me tense...
1	@Astro_Zach Two rules that most often cause a hold are winds and lightning.  So  far lightning is the watch item due to cloud formations
1	@romn8tr Thanks.  @ulalaunch please alert the Swag Master
1	@Blkwooly we agree. #zeus @george_sowers
1	@jabe8 @ULALunch i hope not ;)
1	@Astro_Zach idk yet
1	@Astro_Zach about a week
1	@ULALunch @Astro_Zach welcome back
1	@Bubbinski @tanyaofmars nice
1	@w_mccan @Astro_Zach @rocketrepreneur @OSIRISREx every day ;)
1	@romn8tr what's is called?
1	@WinterBynes thanks
1	@VladimirVjel @Astro_Zach @OSIRISREx 40% discount ;)
1	.@sparklefingered I am continually amazed at the enthusiasm  interest and sophistication of the space enthusiast community
1	Please see what we can di @ulalaunch  https://t.co/2Gufuo7mIR
1	@jabe8 pick up anywhere you like... So long as it's Cape Canaveral or Vandenberg
1	@MarkMic35809922 @jabe8 yup. That's an average... And ignoring planetary escape  which is technically infinite milage ;)
1	@romn8tr @BigelowSpace Good question for Bob. The full scale versions are Very impressive. Bigger than my first apartment
1	@ZeroGravityKyle @NASAWatch I'm working in that. My vision is the democratization of space.
1	@KayDesigner @ULALunch cool idea
1	@Astro_Zach See you when I get back
1	@Robotbeat gets looked at periodically. Theoretically possible. G-levels limit what you can launch
1	@Astro_Zach Mrs Bruno and I also road tripped out to ULA when I came on board  but from the opposite direction.
1	@ZeroGravityKyle @MythBusters @ebuhulk Think so. I remember the episode
1	@sparklefingered @RobertTBigelow Deal
1	@_spacehorizons @ulalaunch @RooseveltHSLA Just made a personal donation on your website.  Keep up the good work
1	@ChrisDMarshall Theoretically  but I don't anticipate that being an issue
1	@holliemaea @John_Gardi It takes more than money to do things right...
1	@John_Gardi Yes it is
1	@tehWKD We can now confirm the Customer's request
1	@tehWKD We don't talk about NRO Club...
1	@beatgr @ulalaunch Good eye
1	@BonhommeJerome @ben_pri @dslsynth Always
1	.@Raumfahrer_net @JWidlar @ShuttleAlmanac The heritage is embodied in the people who designed successive birds &amp; handed down their knowledge
1	@Astro_Zach @NASA_Johnson Very cool
1	@dslsynth @spacechelle @TheOnion ok with me
1	@dslsynth component testing. Engine firings in Tx or Stennis
1	@siberia_fans @ulalaunch nice
1	@Space_Damien @tanyaofmars @FailedProtostar nice
1	@claranellist @tanyaofmars @CERN @ATLASexperiment @CERN @ATLASexperiment @ulalaunch Anything named Atlas must be very promising ;)
1	.@John_Gardi Careful is good
-1	.@LisaStoj Yup.  Just saw that.  Darn.  I'll be watching tomorrow
-1	.@smenor @DanSpace77 Yes.  It defined the American Ethos and captured the essence of our human destiny.
1	.@ulalaunch @dslsynth 42
-1	@dslsynth No.  We'll downselect to 1 engine.  It will power Vulcan booster. RD180-Atlas retires.  Atlas' Centaur  Avionics  etc. continue on
1	@NASAWatch @ulalaunch Attracted by your thought provoking journalism?
1	@DougonTech @spacecom @rocketrepreneur I am embracing reusability
1	@Robotbeat @spacecom @rocketrepreneur break even at 10 reuses is based on 10 to 30 flights per year  indicative of today's market.
1	@Robotbeat On an exp  it wouldn't exist at all.  Everything added for reuse  is additional cost that must be paid off via successive reuses.
1	@rappolee @spacecom @rocketrepreneur Likely*
1	@rappolee @spacecom @rocketrepreneur lkely
1	@Robotbeat @spacecom @rocketrepreneur Nope. Fly back adds significant hardware and logistics. Even SMART has a 2 reuse breakeven
1	@Robotbeat @spacecom @rocketrepreneur factored in
1	@spacecom @rocketrepreneur Most studies say around 10 reuses for each booster to break even  then savings increasing with each add'l reuse
1	@Agrutter87Alex @rocketrepreneur @Robotbeat @jabe8 thanks
1	@Astro_Zach Shhhhh
1	@Blkwooly @andyweirauthor @BlairBigelow @BigelowSpace That could be done  but then limitted to tiny habitat volumes. BA330 will be luxurious
1	.@Blkwooly @andyweirauthor @BlairBigelow @BigelowSpace   Their materials are proprietary  but pretty sturdy stuff. Think "kevlar vest++"
1	@Avron_p @ulalaunch A very interesting idea.  Will take a little while to become practical
-1	@Robotbeat T/W comparisons can be a little tricky.  Ie; which components counted in W.  Which conditions used for T...
1	@Blkwooly @evankirstel @mariella_moon @engadget Good question for @BigelowSpace @BlairBigelow
-1	@Blkwooly @evankirstel @mariella_moon @engadget Center core structure rigid mounts equipment
1	@nicosuave9 @ulalaunch Nice.  Been there.  Good luck
1	.@VGChiefTrainer @george_sowers @NASA_SLS Yes I do.  Water is everywhere.  Its the great discovery of our time
1	@Blkwooly @evankirstel @mariella_moon @engadget BA330 will be more of an "expandable". Better impact resist  usable walls  gigantic volume
1	@Astro_Zach great. He is a very interesting guy
1	@Shankovich @ulalaunch @Agrutter87Alex great idea
1	Ok. @ulalaunch please ask the Swag Master to make it so https://t.co/sLD5XuakgM
1	@romn8tr @ulalaunch @thefrownyface Amateur built
1	@Crow_T_Robot noble work
1	@enn_ess_eff @ulalaunch I'm blushing
1	.@Astro_Zach The feeling is mutual
1	@Astro_Zach Cool guy. Say Hi
1	@Astro_Zach @ISDC @eonasa She's awesome.  You'll like her.  Say Hi
1	@twuelfing @DefenseOne @ToddHarrisonDC https://t.co/a9gBgbjrzm
1	@twuelfing @DefenseOne @ToddHarrisonDC ULA came into existence 10 years ago. This and all prior administrations wanted RD180s
1	@DrPhiltill And great vibration transmissibility properties
1	@stromspace I am both
-1	@DougonTech since we fly so often to so many orbits  this will become a low cost frequent ride. Think airline vs charter flight
1	@Astrofotografen @ZeroGravityKyle Cool. I have a Coronado on a basic german mount. Love it
1	@DougonTech got one. Adding 24 U carrier to Centaur. My vision is to have that on every flight  doubling world cubesat access by ourselves
1	@Astrofotografen @ZeroGravityKyle Nice.  What do you have?
1	@dslsynth  Great NASA papers on this. Short answer: managing beam intensity to safe and manageable levels.  Like terrestrial pwr plants...
1	@nicosuave9  Cleaning out the "attic" in Pueblo.  @ulalaunch please ask Propulsion if they have anything useful that we could spare
1	@Astro_Zach Sounds fun
1	@travlinmo  @RobertTBigelow @ulalaunch Math works once we are able to build these structure in space from materials originating there
1	@Astro_Zach Welcome
1	.@NanoRacks @dovesinspace @Space_Station Congratulations
1	@aleroi the first via the second
1	@nicosuave9 @ulalaunch Cool
1	@mlmarshall13 @ZeroGravityKyle Very pretty.  Had these back home on the ranch growing up.  Thanks for the nostalgic moment.
-1	@thatspacegeek @ulalaunch I'm afraid not.  Colorado  California  Alabama  Florida  and Texas
1	@astrodave2 Will do
1	@CO_Space_News Good luck
1	@sparklefingered I'd say about a 1998-WT24. ;)
1	@AstronautAbby luck
1	@Mtshaw113 @ulalaunch @_spacehorizons You were a very bright and perceptive 11th grader
1	@StrathUniMoot @ZeroGravityKyle @SpaceLawMoot @UniLeiden Good luck to all
-1	@compulog @ulalaunch @jeff_foust My long term vision is the #CisLunar1000. Our contribution will be a revolution in space transportation
1	@dslsynth @SpaceX It will take some number of flights and experience to understand how much refurbishment will be required
1	@ThierryLegault @NASAWatch Nice
1	@Astro_Zach Good luck
1	@sparklefingered @NASA they say we have 300 days of sunshine. Just not lately...
1	@sparklefingered So he's a handsome devil then?  ;)
1	@Astro_Zach Me too
1	@sparklefingered @NASA Snow's all gone. But now we have rain
1	@ChrisDMarshall @ulalaunch yes
1	@sparklefingered @WinterBynes @aiaa @LockheedMartin @garynapier not many
1	@SpaceKSCBlog @CalPoly SLO. Me too  at Lockheed
1	@DrPhiltill @mirikramer @Gap Tell me about it...;)
1	@Astro_Zach as lomg as its job related. ;)
1	@Astro_Zach Heaven awaits...
1	@joshWAAY31 @KDVR Thanks
1	@dslsynth @ulalaunch Cool idea.  @ulalaunch What can we do?
1	@nicosuave9 We'll check @ulalaunch
1	@KayDesigner @bertrandpiccard @DrPhiltill @TamithaSkov I am honored
1	@KayDesigner great idea;)
1	@dslsynth @ulalaunch thanks
1	@AstronautAbby Great talk.  You inspire me. https://t.co/q6oiYRrwBP
1	@ajebbatson @ulalaunch Super chilling adds a lot of operational complexity for small benefit.  Atlas is so powerful  we have not needed it
1	@dslsynth I think that's me
-1	@rebranded @ZeroGravityKyle (The non-explosive version...).  ;)
1	@dslsynth Ratio. It modifies the flow of RP1 so that fuel and oxidizer stay balanced and finish at the same time
1	@dslsynth https://t.co/FINR5RZkEc
1	@dslsynth thanks. Horses are in the barn
1	@ChristinaFavre @ulalaunch @NASASocial @OSIRISREx @LockheedMartin cool
1	@kiamruiz @ZeroGravityKyle @OSIRISREx Your secret is safe with us.
1	@juliunstarks @ZeroGravityKyle Have fun
1	@donnadiddit @ZeroGravityKyle @NASASocial Have fun
1	@garynapier @ZeroGravityKyle @OSIRISREx @LockheedMartin Have fun today Gary
1	@stormchasing @ZeroGravityKyle Drive carefully
1	@milehighfly @ZeroGravityKyle @OSIRISREx *fun
1	@milehighfly @ZeroGravityKyle @OSIRISREx have fin
1	@Braun23Austin @OSIRISREx Have fun. We are getting OsirisRex's bus ready at the rocket factory...
1	@Sweetmankind @ZeroGravityKyle  Me too
1	@rocketrepreneur @TrampolinRocket Next time.  We fly every month
1	@John_Gardi @TrampolinRocket Next best thing to standing outside at the Cape is sitting in the CO Ops Center with our Rocket Scientists.
1	@TrampolinRocket Let us know the next time you are in Florida or Colorado
1	@Astro_Zach And it touches our lives every day...
1	@Mausonaut @ulalaunch @esa Great question
1	Well done @AstronautAbby  https://t.co/FhzW7qoskv
1	@AstronautAbby I'm back
1	@tcortellesi @TheMarsGen No.  (But we do have an on-line store at https://t.co/mZR0T9YwBy) ;)
1	@TheMarsGen Warming up for Vulcan-ACES first flight. #TrainLikeAMartian https://t.co/JzyeqbiJhh
-1	@thefrownyface @EmmaJoycen @realscientists No  I'm afraid not
1	@SpaceKSCBlog I like the way you think
1	@KristiB67 @SusieMUC @TheMarsGen Its a mystery
1	@SusieMUC @TheMarsGen She's kind of a chicken
1	@AidanShaffer @Waypoint2Space @ulalaunch Great idea!
-1	@TheMarsGen Ok. I've got the obstacle course set up. #TrainLikeAMartian https://t.co/ATp4kThxgN
-1	@jabe8 Sorry.  Only US Persons at present.
-1	@mikamckinnon Drop my PA a line jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com
1	@jabe8 I did at Lockheed Martin...
1	@621Lynn @TheMarsGen Yes. Small but nice. Outdoor pools don't get much use in Colorado. Bit cold in the winter...
1	@621Lynn @TheMarsGen . I prefer the treadmill  but I've had a banged up ankle ever since my horse fell on me
1	@MatthewPinegar thanks
-1	@NASAWatch @ulalaunch @TheMarsGen Only a lap pool. And my lap dog's afraid of the water...
1	@dslsynth idk. What's the answer @ulalaunch ?
1	@dslsynth @TheMarsGen @Raspberry_Pi very cool
1	@LoriMoreno @CordairGallery @jeffcbeer Does it come with the plane and underground hanger? ;)
1	@AlanStern @DanSpace77 @TIME Well deserved
1	Dippin' instead of skippin'. #TrainLikeAMartian @TheMarsGen https://t.co/PzvfCUjHob
1	@albiondumsday A trim 64 lbm.
1	@hanlonesq @CalPolyCubeSat @NavalAcademy ok
1	@tehWKD wirking with Tyvac on that right now
1	@zperrin99 @ulalaunch It was our pleasure
1	@lexcalibur100 @ulalaunch Central coast
1	@stromspace That would be an odd thing to discover in my hotel room ;)
1	@DougonTech @BigelowSpace @ulalaunch @RobertTBigelow We don't discuss private investments
1	@wikkit @rocketrepreneur yikes!
1	.@KayDesigner @HofSwitzerland Wow. I wonder how long a snowman would last on the pad next to a Delta Heavy?
1	@KayDesigner @HofSwitzerland I'm willing to try anything at this point
1	@dslsynth micro meteorite impact
-1	@dslsynth It has an advanced semi-rigid insulation that also provides MMI protection
1	@sparklefingered cool
1	@Robotbeat @prezcannady I see a time when Earthly rockets never go beyond LEO because reused ACES' will be waiting there to finish the lift
1	@Robotbeat @prezcannady The Cislunar economy will need a lot of Space Trucks...
1	@Robotbeat @JRascagneres @ulalaunch Don't know yet.  8m  transitions to SLS class.  So  I don't plan to go that big.
1	.@prezcannady Reusable engines on first stage.  Entirely reusable upper stage.  Once we learn more about reuse  I see this expanding
1	.@JRascagneres @ulalaunch For any given mission  ACES removes 1 or 2 SRMs. Will also enable  new missions &amp; change the way we go to space.
-1	.@tlaustin @UpportunityU @ulalaunch I'm afraid you've got me there.  But I am more aerodynamic ;)
1	.@JRascagneres @ulalaunch Much bigger impact with a reusable upper stage  so we'll do ACES first  then FS engine recovery
1	.@JRascagneres @ulalaunch Actually  going as fast as we can already.  Doing this in about half the historical time.
1	@ZeroGravityKyle Just under 7000 ft.  Its closer to space...
1	@tanyaofmars have some sour dough for me
1	@BP_Hutch @AstroAnarchy @Crow_T_Robot @genejm29 @HighElfArchmage @g_cgarza167 @romn8tr I'm blushing
1	@romn8tr @ulalaunch cool
1	@BallAerospace @ulalaunch  it was my pleasure. You guys rock (et)
1	@Mad_Maelstrom @GregAveryDenBiz @JeffBezos @ulalaunch yup
1	@rocketrepreneur @ulalaunch next time
1	@AstroAnarchy @romn8tr @Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch   Me too. Next time
1	@NASAWatch @BigelowSpace @BlairBigelow we deliver like a capsule. B330 is a spacecraft. Take itself in. Docking/birthing has options
1	@rappolee @NASAWatch Mighty Atlas Centaur can lift almost anything
1	@rocketrepreneur @wikkit on track. Doing well
1	@AstroAnarchy @Crow_T_Robot @PointyEndUp @BP_Hutch thanks
1	@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch @AstroAnarchy @PointyEndUp @BP_Hutch thanks
1	@dtarsgeorge @John_Gardi @RobertTBigelow @SpaceflightNow thanks
1	@AstroAnarchy @BP_Hutch I understand
1	@KayDesigner thanks
1	@AscendingNode @NASASpaceflight @CwG_NSF muah  ha  ha...
1	@NASASpaceflight @AscendingNode What can I say... I'm an expressive guy ;)
1	.@ErinLowenberg @ulalaunch They love you too
1	.@AndrewMunsell97 @ulalaunch @Boeing Yes
1	@DanCMos next time
1	@AstronautAbby done
1	@sparklefingered @OrbitalATK thank you
1	.@TheMarsGen Sounds pretty cool. Hard to say no to @AstronautAbby. Let me see what we can do @ulalaunch
1	@zen_and_rockets @rocketrepreneur @ulalaunch @BigelowSpace  Monday
-1	@Pat_DefDaily jessica.rye@ulalaunch has my media calendar. Drop her a line
1	@dslsynth @LaunchComplex i like the way you think
1	.@LaunchComplex Right.  Good tip
1	.@dslsynth but just think how fast I could get between venues ;)
1	@LauraForczyk @mastenspace @blueorigin @SpaceX @ulalaunch @virgingalactic ariane
1	@AsteroidEnergy Yes it is. @ulalaunch  what's the answer?
1	@rocketrepreneur @george_sowers @ulalaunch see you there. Asked staff to set aside time and a room on Wed for me to be avail to Social
1	@Berger_SN @ulalaunch ULA generates its own resources via ongoing contracts
1	@AidanShaffer @namdog27 not this time
1	@AstroAnarchy @romn8tr @george_sowers thanks
1	.@namdog27 Talking to a great set of engineering students about Spaaace. #wyo
1	@stephmbrown Right.
1	@rappolee @jeff_foust IDK
1	@dslsynth don't know yet
1	@TrampolinRocket congratulations. Cool name
1	@TrevorMahlmann @yourtake @PurdueAlumni @CanonUSAimaging @CanonUSApro @PurdueEngineers @PurdueKrannert Congratulations
1	.@KerbalFax @ulalaunch @KerbalSpaceP Cool. Comfort to know you're there ;)
1	@Sen_Sherwood @andresdavid Me too
1	@rappolee I have no info beyond my earlier reply
1	@rappolee @BoeingDefense @JeffBezos ULA does not own SeaLaunch.
1	@rappolee @BoeingDefense @JeffBezos No
1	.@jabe8 @blueorigin @JeffBezos Been many times. Yes  Spent time with Jeff. He is a remarkable guy. Earned my respect as a rocket scientist
1	@sparklefingered @rc55 Send your contact info to jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com  @ulalaunch
1	@rappolee That is correct
1	@rappolee @John_Gardi @jeff_foust Not over yet
1	@John_Gardi @OrbitalATK Not that I am aware
1	@Astro_Zach @JeffBezos Hmmmmm
1	.@John_Gardi @jeff_foust Thanks OA4 was less than a year from first conversation to on orbit.
1	@AstroAnarchy @TONDTGR @romn8tr @CalPoly Likewise
1	@NASAWatch That is correct.  We worked this out between us as the right thing to do  and brought it to NASA
-1	@chadshores @ulalaunch Drop my PA a line jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch and she will connect you to our Delta team
1	@dslsynth That is how it works
1	@Astro_Zach Knowledge and talent @ulalaunch
1	.@TrampolinRocket Colorado:  Last Easter  This easter ;) https://t.co/igXWjvMMDk
1	@Crow_T_Robot Give my PA a call jessica.f.rye@ulalaunch.com
1	@AidanShaffer @Robotbeat Yes it is.  Just 1000 times harder
-1	.@chitownchica @ulalaunch yes  spacecraft have a time limit once fueled  so they decided to delay a few days just in case
1	@rappolee @Astro_Zach @george_sowers Had my own patio furniture issues...  ;) https://t.co/kDQhwN2AXM
-1	@Crow_T_Robot @rappolee @lexcalibur100 @ulalaunch When the customer can accommodate  we de-orbit.  Otherwise  it goes to the disposal orbit
-1	@rappolee @Crow_T_Robot @lexcalibur100 @ulalaunch Yes  there are various options for disposal.  De-orbit was chosen for this mission
1	@SullivansProjs @BraxtonJulie @DeptofDefense @SenShelby We have RD180 because USG asked us to.  Developing replacement as fast as possible
1	.@Astro_Zach Gotta love CO.  70F on Tues.  blizzard on Wed.  All done and melting Thrs.
1	.@rappolee @lexcalibur100 @ulalaunch It was planned to de-orbit after the Cygnus was placed  for orbital debris mitigation rqmnts.
1	@lexcalibur100 @ChrisDMarshall @jeff_foust @ulalaunch Yes.  Shared the facts  but won't speculate on root cause until we are sure.
1	@lexcalibur100 @TrampolinRocket @SpaceNews_Inc We are fully transparent with USG &amp; will support the IG.
1	@rappolee @lexcalibur100 @ulalaunch Cygnus de-orbited.  Just a little further down range
1	@Cardoso Thanks
1	@skyfire747 Yup
-1	@Simberg_Space @ulalaunch Sometimes we are volume constrained (not mass)
1	.@geedropsthemic @OrbitalATK Oh yes.  In rocketry  "nominal" is the best word you can hear
1	@Cardoso For an ISS rendezvous  yes
1	@Simberg_Space @ulalaunch yes
1	@Simberg_Space @ulalaunch Yes
-1	@Robotbeat She's a beauty  but I'm afraid I still get butterflies  even as I approach my 400th launch
1	@ProjectLRNJ @Ascii211 I just put it on
1	.@Simberg_Space @ulalaunch Right!  Mighty Atlas has the brains and the brawn
1	.@ulalaunch Gotta love that Right Ascension of the Ascending Node steering algorithm...
1	@AstroAnarchy @BP_Hutch Back at ya'
1	@KerbalFax @KSpaceAcademy Yup.  Isp of pancake batter is good  but LOX/RP1 is a bit higher ;)
1	@KSpaceAcademy might need a little remodeling...
1	@dslsynth yes
1	@rappolee @NASAWatch @ulalaunch Not that I'm aware of. FAR focus is making sure the USG gets a fair/good deal
1	@Astro_Zach you probably wont be. But you can be in the room with us or in the gallery behind us  watching the same screens
1	@Astro_Zach 2 Cntrs.  1 at pad  controlling Ops.  1 in Denver  supporting with 100 engrs on console  solving issues  &amp; the weather team
1	@Astro_Zach Pic doesn't show all of it.  About the same
1	@Astro_Zach "DOSC"
1	@Astro_Zach Second photo down  on the right
1	@joshWAAY31 @ulalaunch Will do our best
1	@joshWAAY31 Yes  you may use this and any other InfoG I have posted @ulalaunch
1	Mighty Atlas will sit the pad tonight at nearly a million pounds.  Within minutes  90% of that weight will be shed @Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch
-1	@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch   Centaur's high energy cryogenic propellants allow it to operate for 7 hours &amp; 3 burns  far longer than any other
-1	@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch  Centaur's fuel tanks are thinner than a dime  only holding their shape when pressurized
1	@Crow_T_Robot @ulalaunch Mighty Atlas carries a double load. This and last year's missions catch the ISS up from the prior lost missions
1	@John_Gardi there should be
1	@dslsynth Shhhhhh... ;)
1	@JRascagneres a handful at first. Eventually dozens or more. 1000 people will need a lot of space trucks
1	@romn8tr Thanks
1	@JRascagneres @SpaceX Competition is healthy for customers and the industry
1	@JohnMcGauley Its mostly about the ConOps at the launch site.  Parallel Ops  short integration spans (&amp; a great Rocket and pad)
1	@astro_navis @ulalaunch Good luck!
1	@Astro_Zach That can be arranged
1	@Astro_Zach Sometimes leadership is about delegation
1	@Astro_Zach Great question for your interviewer when you get here
1	@KayDesigner @ulalaunch Yes.  106th launch
-1	@Stian_Nuland @ulalaunch Not a mass issue.  The challenge with tank art is the LOX frosting it over.  We're looking at some clever ideas
1	@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch Zach  you accomplished this on your own
1	@ZeroGravityKyle A wise man
1	@dslsynth @ulalaunch thanks
1	Yes.  I've asked my PA folks to schedule time for me to be available to meet our friends on Social @ulalaunch  https://t.co/fu2I3rTPdu
-1	@Astro_Zach sorry
1	@KayDesigner low inclination orbits (near the equator like GEO) take less energy when launched from near the equator
1	@dslsynth Not yet  feel free to tweet
1	@ponder68 @HomerHickam @Rand_Simberg Likewise
1	@KayDesigner The most common trajectory strategy is to rise vertically to spend less time in the dense atmo  then pitch over &amp; gain velocity
1	@RichardFPenn @thomassturm Absolutely.  Artist anchored it at JFK's speech.  Good have started earlier
1	Now that's an interesting idea @ulalaunch  https://t.co/UpQ579oemU
1	.@EllenStofan @AlanStern @NASANewHorizons Congratulations!
1	@Znapel @ulalaunch Opportunity for synergy with lots of folks. Our role is the Space Transportation that makes these new missions possible
1	@dslsynth @Astro_Zach Yup *Cygnus
1	@dslsynth That has a ring to it
1	@EPerezTrevino @ulalaunch @KSpaceAcademy Gracias
1	@dslsynth @Astro_Zach Will do
-1	@KSpaceAcademy @KerbalFax Eh  What could go wrong  ;)
1	.@Astro_Zach I don't see why not :)
1	@KerbalFax @beatgr @KSpaceAcademy I can take it...
1	@MV_Paul @LunarLionPSU @SpaceX @virgingalactic @JeffBezos Good old Polaris A1.  A3 was still flying for the UK in the 90s
1	@MV_Paul @LunarLionPSU @SpaceX @virgingalactic @JeffBezos Goddard would be proud
1	@marsbeyond Don't recall off the top of my head  but I believe @PlanetaryRsrcs might have interesting info on their website
1	@prezcannady I am rich in other ways.  Great family  best job in the world  making a difference for humanities' future
1	@rocketrepreneur @doyleja71 @TrampolinRocket @upperlevelwinds More to do with the autopilot.  We actually "lean in" to shear  then readjust
1	.@doyleja71 @TrampolinRocket @upperlevelwinds Within Atlas and Delta allowable.  Dynamic trajectory compensates
1	@SEGPDK @Astro_Zach That's for the RL10 line.  You'll see the RD180 come in below on the Atlas III line
1	@Crow_T_Robot We'll put one on the ULA website @ulalaunch
1	@wikkit Artis took the moon program as the reference point.  So  pre-existing missiles used in Mercury and Gemini appear without progenitors
1	@doyleja71 @TrampolinRocket @upperlevelwinds  Every rocket has unique criteria. That specific condition likely within our allowable.
1	@dsfpspacefl1ght check our website's archives. If memory serves  Bernard Kutter published a very good paper. @ulalaunch
1	@dempsas @ulalaunch @tehWKD No worries.  Hit the ULA website and go under "media"
1	.@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch Congratulations
1	.@ulalaunch @tehWKD (We rarely say no...)
-1	@Blkwooly ACES will have an ACS system utilizing "waste" propellants
1	@kycutter2914 @ulalaunch Early 2020s
1	@Astro_Zach @ulalaunch @CynthiaNafus Your safe. I'm in NY at RPI. Good luck
1	@Robotbeat @Marslauncher @marsbeyond @spacecom Correct.  Once in LEO  you're half way to anywhere... This will shatter the current paradigm
1	@AlexDillo1 @ulalaunch @_r_ULA BE4 privately funded.  AR1 receiving an RPS award.  ULA receiving co-investment to incorp US engine into LV
1	.@ChrisDMarshall No  but that's a great idea.  @ulalaunch
1	@marsbeyond @Marslauncher @Robotbeat @spacecom  we will develop the fully reusable ACES upperstage and SMART ...after we replace RD180
1	@JPMajor @NAICobservatory @JohnBSheldon @gmanewsonline Ha  looks like we are expanding 😀
1	@Bens_Lab thanks 😀
1	@NuclearAnthro thanks  cheers!
1	@Ailish96 oh yes 😀
1	@Ailish96 nope  everything is fine 🙂
1	@DaveMosher @caleb_scharf Our version 😀 https://t.co/jXLuKGZbv2
1	@cosmos4u and we want to find more from the Arecibo Observatory. They are now re-observing the first discovered with much higher precision.
1	@LarryNittler @DrFunkySpoon @StarzanPlanets
1	@paulsanderson oh  I was wondering who was the source. Thanks for the detail.
1	@paulsanderson Ha  thanks. 😀
1	@b0yle @NewHorizons2015 @NASANewHorizons Will update soon https://t.co/OpVrZgNqsR
1	@SCStreet yes  and they will cite that paper in their proposal to observe or construct such instruments.
1	@SCStreet yes  especially if that experimental setup might produce significant results.
1	Hoy estaré con @PlanetTreky y @DeborahWAPA hablando de ciencia en el @NAICobservatory https://t.co/YDpAuhBQpP https://t.co/xeQbSFzl0q
1	@PlanetTreky @NAICobservatory Ja  excelente.
1	@ChriszeeebraZee almost half the distance between them.
1	@SpaceHedge indeed  cheers 😀
1	@RichardFPenn @GabrielBFonseca initial water inventory plus delivery is part of a complex early history of any planet.
1	@RichardFPenn Ha! 😀
-1	@ScottWx_TWN @JPMajor @AstroKatie that critic was using the same interpretation of the public to reach conclusions 😊
1	@ScottWx_TWN @JPMajor @AstroKatie nobody will complain about a Jupiter Similarity Index  or calling a planet Jupiter-like 😀
1	@ScottWx_TWN @JPMajor @AstroKatie same happens with the "habitable zone"  like if the public misinterpret the term then the science is wrong
1	@ScottWx_TWN @MiradaCientific @PlanetaryHabLab ESI = 0.87 details here https://t.co/fKMCoTtl1U
-1	@Richardhurst19 nebulas are too cold and diluted  a fluid  water or any other liquid  is necessary to concentrate and promote reactions.
1	@pcastano ja  'evolución.' 😀
1	"The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact with other life. … we have been offered contact.” -@WilliamShatner @StarTrek
1	@HughO2 @suthers @nadiamdrake @AllPlanets ADS titles have from Mercury-like to Pluto-like  except Uranus-like for some unknown reason. 😃
1	@nadiamdrake @AllPlanets On ADS there are over x10 ‘Earth-like’ title references than from all other planets combined. None 'Uranus-like’ 😃
1	@nadiamdrake @AllPlanets ‘Jupiter-like’  ‘Neptune-like’ or ‘Venus-like’ seems fine with everybody  but not ‘Earth-like’ 😜 #preconceptions
-1	@ArtOfAstronomy it’s too irregular and sometimes chaotic to be easily explained by any known individual or combined mechanisms.
1	@tcortellesi boundaries are based on too little or too much atmosphere. Outside HZ not possible to have liquid water  inside the HZ maybe.
1	@tcortellesi you can ask directly the authors for the papers. Their emails are usually in the abstract page. 😃
1	@GabrielBFonseca @nyrath That’s considered in the definition of the habitable zone  the borders are based on very optimistic assumptions.
1	@PeterDEdmonds @MichaelDWall @JPMajor New revised parameters on K2-72 coming soon https://t.co/niGLtFDmr8
1	Latest @NASAKepler K2 results for the K2-72 planets are interesting but we have to way for additional results. https://t.co/niGLtFDmr8
1	We finished the analysis of the new @NASAKepler K2 data. We are now in the review process. Very interesting!
1	The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog will be updated tomorrow with new @NASAKepler K2 planets https://t.co/niGLtFDmr8 https://t.co/wlyaC1FPAn
1	@Leaving_Orbit pictures when ready 😃
1	@fedkukso indeed 😃
1	@zaksheskyman maybe @InvaderXan knows  he is the author of the post.
1	@AstroKatie @mikamckinnon Here is our latest version  more informative. We are working on a new one too. 😃 https://t.co/VqLCYk0LMl
1	The @NASAKepler account was hacked. Don’t click links 😟
1	@IreneElisabethH … and the image was not credited 😃
1	@Foortography enjoy  cheers 😀
1	@davidwdubois This is a graphic I like that shows the estimated amount of liquid water in the Solar System. https://t.co/QLflZhGo6U

1	@eskimo_irl @novapbs shucks!
1	First shot of the first day for our @novapbs 2 hour special on #BlackHoles fun https://t.co/3gIFl974oZ
1	@selennata @WaltrJohnson417 @AnneOestreicher I'm in DC now. Next time
1	A glowing galaxy came out my mouth @NOVAeducation @novapbs
1	@SheriB1968 I spend a lot of time in LA  but just got back. Will post here or on website when I make it back
1	@SheriB1968 Actually  I'll be in San Francisco for an event on 9/30. Stay tuned
1	@Scirens @brainpicker @TheMoth Shucks! Love it.
1	@quadraticadder @PBS as far as we can tell  yes. and according to theory  yes.
1	If tachyons can't interact with us  we cannot manipulate them to study the universe @supa67 @quadraticadder
1	Yes! @quadraticadder @supa67
-1	There are problems with tachyons. Most damning  they're probably not real. If they r real  they can't interact w/ us @supa67 @quadraticadder
1	.@ThusSpokeJon @quadraticadder @supa67 yes actually
1	They can never slow to light's speed. In a sense  they perceive time to be in the direction of their motion. @quadraticadder @supa67
-1	Hypothetically  tachyons would travel faster than light and have less than no mass  which is to say negative mass @quadraticadder @supa67
1	.@SkyLeach @ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson The Higgs field may decay one day  but we hope not. We'd all sort of disintegrate I guess
1	@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson What we mean here is that a light pulse from a great enough distance will never cover enough ground
-1	.@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson Similarly  there can be a static background electric field  even when there are no particles.
-1	.@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson The Higgs field is different from particles. The background field stayed. The particles decayed.
1	.@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson At some point  the universe expands faster than light can race. light traveling to us still recedes
-1	.@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson That's there are none lying around to hold in your hand. And why the LHC didn't collect any
-1	.@ThusSpokeJon @StarTalkRadio @neiltyson The Higgs interacts with so many other particles  that it very quickly decays into lighter debris
-1	@BenMakesTV oooh that's bad
1	Huh  @CNN covers science? That's good news https://t.co/PLGxBDOjW6
1	Hanging with my pal @iraflatow from @scifri   can't shake the feeling that the radio is on
1	.@hackenslash1 @katebevan @grahamfarmelo @marcuschown @NeilShubin @seanmcarroll @JamesGleick @ProfBrianCox honored by the great company
1	@mhultstrom @AstroKPJ @neiltyson @sandygrains It counts IMHO
-1	.@nemmen @AstroKPJ @neiltyson @sandygrains Yes  but @LIGO cannot detect supermassive BH's. The notes are way too low.
1	.@croftandi @levelback A rocket trying to escape a black hole is firing engines and not in free fall. Free fall is weightlessness  no forces
1	.@croftandi @levelback It's hard to form enough black holes to explain dark matter. If they started as stars they'd start as ordinary matter
1	.@DavidHesperos @martronaut Yes  quantum entanglement seems to involve communication of quantum information faster than c. Amazing
1	@GenerationSpace Excellent! She's a dear friend
-1	.@DavidHesperos neutrinos have no electric charge so don't feel E&amp;M  but they have weak charge  which is why they feel the weak force.
1	.@DavidHesperos @martronaut yes it is hard. That's why we can only put upper limits on the mass. We know it's smaller than some value
1	.@Sabrosit0 The light is very specific to that type of SN. If you know the specs of a store bought bulb u can tell if it's far or close.
1	.@DavidHesperos @martronaut yes
1	@DavidHesperos @ScienceChannel Thank you!
-1	.@DavidHesperos Every particle is defined by its interactions  which means its charges. A neutrino is a particle with certain charges
1	.@TheGistOf @DavidHesperos @martronaut All massless particles will travel at the cosmic speed limit. If light is massless  then it does too
1	.@DavidHesperos @martronaut In other words  they are highly relativistic
1	.@DavidHesperos @martronaut Neutrinos with a tiny bit of mass can travel near c but not at c. Massless neutrinos can travel at c
1	.@DavidHesperos @martronaut There are experiments that measure the mass differences between neutrino species. So some of them have mass.
1	And this event tonight: Science and Story: The Instinct for Curiosity https://t.co/2oQIrdqf9p via @WorldSciFest
1	I'll be in this event from 2pm - 3pm today: Science And Story Café https://t.co/xgYALSB3Es via @WorldSciFest
1	@gdinwiddie @Grady_Booch Ha. Exactly!
1	@tim_reichardt with Einstein's own face on them
1	@drkenyon Notice Einstein postage stamps
1	@tim_reichardt Notice Einstein postage stamps
1	Cool! This is up: "Listening in on the ‘Black Hole Blues ’ the soundtrack of the universe" https://t.co/MeqdpNUxFX via @NewsHour
1	.@hackenslash1 I am reminded that I sent out a request to my musician friends to riff on the theme. Go.
1	@hackenslash1 and I've forgotten again. Ha! Will keep this in hand
1	@hackenslash1 I never remember the haiku rules
1	@mycargoship @NewsHour I did! But I'm in Australia.
1	@Elgin21 @GlobeMoskowitz Thank you! So glad to know people are watching the @NewsHour
-1	Rumor has it  PBS @NewsHour will air my interview on #BlackHoleBlues tonight  if you happen to be near your tv's.
1	.@ScienceNelson @BBCRadio4 We should do that again! Fun.
1	.@hackenslash1 @JamesGleick Ha! Yes.
1	.@MeirSimchah probably you're right  marketplace
1	@BenMakesTV thank you!
1	.@geekdom7 @nattyover @QuantaMagazine @GregBoustead Shucks. Honestly they didn't use the really saucy pictures.
1	.@hackenslash1 @seanmcarroll @JenLucPiquant This would have been during my sabbatical at @Caltech when I started writing #BlackHoleBlues
1	.@hackenslash1 @JamesGleick @StarTalkRadio yes agreed but if I included all the caveats it wouldn't have sounded as good
1	@Iangfyfe @JamesGleick @SamHarrisOrg @futurism might be kind of exciting
1	@geekdom7 ha! pretty funny
1	2/2 .@DaveJohnson776 And the sun is  as you say  formed from debris synthesized in a previous star and cast out in a supernovae
1	1/2 .@DaveJohnson776 Great question. We can't know when the black holes formed exactly  but may have been before the formation of the sun
1	Always appreciate when someone notices a small turn of phrase. Thanks @TrueSciPhi  https://t.co/WyyIy9jDG1
1	@PeterDEdmonds Yes  so glad to meet. Much appreciated. Stay tuned. Cheers
1	@dogon60 @CBCQuirks Ah  shucks  thanks. I don't usually get nervous on the radio. It's like talking on the phone. Hope you like the book.
-1	In case you missed Quirks &amp; Quarks...or wait  that's today! @CBCQuirks  https://t.co/5iN2vsMNui
1	@gravitate_to_me Yay!
1	.@mnicholsdevguy @scifri Excellent
-1	In case you missed the @scifri interview live  they've posted here: "Catching Sonic Wisps of Cataclysmic Mayhem" https://t.co/pJCqD14WMt
1	Turns out it's much easier to hit retweet than type. Thanks @scifri for that tweet fest.
1	.@kirktaylor @scifri sweet. Yes  I'll announce events here as they come up. Dates span April and June with some down time in between. Cheers
1	.@kirktaylor @scifri Shucks!
1	@RogerHighfield Roger! So good to hear from you. Till soon I hope.
1	.@gravitate_to_me @amazon I just bought a pen with metallic gold ink to match the cover! I'll request you sign our paper. See you soon.
1	. @BrunoTheGreat32  oh no  but I'll sign again tomorrow at noon. Same place
1	. @BrunoTheGreat32 @SVComicCon I'm at booth 921 now! If you miss me  I'll be back at the booth to sign at noon. Hope to see you
1	@Ivan_dssd @novapbs @secretlifer hrmm. No
1	@CrossTalk1818 @novapbs @secretlifer Ha. That's hysterical
1	Could some of these be black hole batteries? @gravitate_to_me  https://t.co/O9JCyQ4rPg
-1	.@TylerAnderson1 @heather_berlin playing devil's advocate  maybe we observe free will. And have to face the burden of explanation
1	.@TylerAnderson1 @heather_berlin I'm gong to choose to drink this water right now. No I'm not. Yes I am.
1	.@TylerAnderson1 @heather_berlin if you mean we are suggesting people choose to be unmotivated  they could only make such a choice if free
1	@dmonbeer @Thom_astro ha. just very chic.
1	Happy to see Laura Condati on @CNN Einstein's gravitational waves do exist https://t.co/SF0TSpjkQy
1	.@PeterDEdmonds ha  good point. it is a bk of the struggle to climb a mountain and yes  the struggle isn't all pretty. but it is inspiring.
1	.@PeterDEdmonds well understand the book isn't out yet and that is not an accurate description. It's actually written w/ great affection
-1	.@gravitate_to_me @_jeffguo all that copy editing agro over gender specific pronouns averted
1	@Kakistocrat @darth @FiveThirtyEight Ha  fun.
-1	@StartsWithABang cool. I'm bad with email but over the hols  I'll find a lazy morning to catch up. Til soon  J
1	.@malster2015 @CNN Yes recycling plants sound like a holy grail  but their issues with waste are as yet unresolved I think. Remains an idea.
1	Will environmental activists embrace nuclear energy? Or will nukes never be clean and safe? #PWSciCon @CNN https://t.co/bKcf8dZgGC
1	@selennatalay @MariaSpiropulu @debbiebere @skdh @starstryder I love that.
1	A one-way ticket to Mars  apply now @CNN https://t.co/82bH10auiU
1	.@ThusSpokeJon Right  ha  I thought it would be funny to do a blind book naming challenge. If that doesn't go well  then we'll get thematic.
-1	.@RobertGaristo Then again  I have seen people look for mild violations of EP in cosmology  but only mild.
1	.@RobertGaristo Ah interesting  well I suppose it might fail but the campaign to find a UV complete theory of GR often keeps some EP in tact
1	@Loose_Lab_Rat @UMich Love it. Thanks for letting me know.
-1	.@RobertGaristo Either the equivalence principle fails at the horizon (it should not) or there's a blazing firewall at the shadow. Or?
1	.@RobertGaristo Most proponents of quantum gravity would say yes  which is why the recent firewall debate was so provocative.
1	@EricShapiro @UMich So glad to hear.
1	.@Chocololololo @perverte_me yes  we are recording. stay tuned.
-1	.@perverte_me @SamHarrisOrg we are building up to free streaming. It turns out that requires technology. But we're on it.
1	.@reneehlozek @sarahkendrew absolutely. An excuse will be found!
1	.@sarahkendrew @reneehlozek wait  the gin is virtual?
1	.@reneehlozek @KarenLMasters shucks Renee  that's the sweetest.
1	.@WorkerAnt4U @astronomeradam @lukedones @hannorein a theoretical astronomer and a theoretical businessman
1	.@hannorein @WorkerAnt4U @lukedones love it
1	.@astronomeradam @lukedones @WorkerAnt4U @hannorein I'll be checking that out too
1	.@lukedones @WorkerAnt4U @hannorein Nice link!
-1	For those sad to miss Steven Weinberg last week  a video from his event at the World Science Festival http://t.co/ugbdEWF1VE @WorldSciFest
1	Looking forward from this moment to that one in the near future when this will be the past. http://t.co/4wWveLnSK3 @WorldSciFest
1	.@GalenQuick @StarTalkRadio Cool  glad you liked. Stayed up late on Mon night to video in for new episode. To air in Fall @NatGeoChannel
1	@PeterDEdmonds Many thanks. Was much fun.
1	@eskimo_irl @NatGeoChannel shucks! love it.
1	.@eskimo_irl @NatGeoChannel  Shucks. Love it!
1	.@pasmith @BarnardMedia @NatGeoChannel Thank you!
1	.@BarnardMedia @NatGeoChannel I forgot. I'm on TV tonight. Neil de Grasse Tyson's Star Talk Live. I wonder if I get that channel...
1	@debbiebere @gkygirlengineer @jumplive @skdh @sc_k For emphasis: Any genuine expertise is valuable.
1	@debbiebere @gkygirlengineer @jumplive @skdh @sc_k Oh of course! I meant that I've been asked to speak outside my expertise.
1	.@gkygirlengineer @jumplive @debbiebere @skdh @sc_k Personally I agree. I want to hear from the geologists on this. From physicists on Higgs
-1	.@gkygirlengineer @jumplive @debbiebere @skdh @sc_k Shame that some (not all) TV peeps want scientists to be  quote  "An Everyman". I am not

1	Thanks. Glad to know people tuned in @JohnRSports @SLSingh
1	@novacop923 @scifri @SLSingh @ImitationGame @nytimes and he deserved the accolade. But for the idea more than the actual machine
1	@scifri @SLSingh Well the "Bombe" was sort of opposite to a Universal Turing Machine. But the idea of mechanizing a computation was in play.
1	More on Turing today. Science Friday with me and my ole friend Simon Singh. Tune in a bit after 3pm @scifri @SLSingh @ImitationGame
1	@PrincessSuperno @gravitate_to_me ha! Shucks. Love it.
1	@gravitate_to_me @Caltech I am yes. Just grabbing a tea first!
1	@yildirimustun @stevenstrogatz @WorldSciFest Turing showed there are an infinite number of unprovable facts among numbers The Uncomputables
1	@yildirimustun @stevenstrogatz @WorldSciFest Godel was first. He showed that a specific mathematical relationship was unprovable.

1	Ran out of space again: @RobertGaristo So LIGO's arms combined are the big nothings.
1	Ran out of Space: @RobertGaristo The LHC cryomagnets however require a much larger vacuum  a hole almost as big as two LIGO arms.
1	@RobertGaristo The LHC beam is thin so even at 27km long the volume is small compared to that of the 4km LIGO arms.
1	@RobertGaristo Nice question. Let me consider while I fly North.
-1	@ScienceChannel In my case the irrational behavior starts when it drops below 60 F
1	@WorldSciFest @TheMoth Thanks for the shoutout
1	@reneehlozek Thanks for the shout out. Great to have you there.
1	@jumplive @AmyMainzer @MariaSpiropulu Ah  wish that I could! Heartache. I'm back in Gotham.
1	@AnnFinkbeiner @peterdedmonds @FrankWilczek No  no  not at all. Go for it.
1	@AnnFinkbeiner @peterdedmonds @FrankWilczek I am writing a bit about black holes now. My way into these stories has to feel first hand.
1	@peterdedmonds @FrankWilczek @AnnFinkbeiner Frank reminded me that some of the story is in Kip Thorne's book. Curious to know primary source
-1	@novapbs @BBCFuture I know it's very naughty but I've actually been trying to do this at home.
1	@therealdjflux Cool.
1	@steveweinstein @davidabatchelor I agree  though  I'll be surprised if any of these are new.
1	@steveweinstein @davidabatchelor Hmm  think that's 95% likely but in theory could have swapped out a disk. "was ever on it' doesn't follow
1	@StrangerNoise @SwiftOnSecurity yeah  sorry to burst your bubble about that... :-)
1	@cosmos4u @HildegardWerth If I understand correctly: para oscillations  confusing altimeter software
1	@hooglemeister A few hundred km/hr
-1	@NatureAstronomy He's saying it's 100My and not later  so I think it's just an argument about what 'late' is
1	@NatureAstronomy hmm seems like he is... so LHB not as late as we thought? Will try and ask him afterwards
1	@NatureAstronomy LHB is different - happens as well I think
1	@PeterDEdmonds @AstroKatie @NASA You say that like it's surprising in some way....
1	@spaceleclerc @csa_asc  you mean  they had actual content!
-1	@cirquelar @jeff_foust @barbylon That's fair. I've frequently argued with editors over house style and NASA guide does help that argument
1	@cirquelar @jeff_foust @barbylon It's style  but style I happen to strongly agree with...
-1	@jeff_foust @cirquelar @barbylon and a quick glance shows their rules only appropriate for US publications  grossly wrong for e.g. UK ones
1	@jeff_foust @cirquelar @barbylon If writing for a NASA pub  I'll follow their style. I don't consider them an authority of style otherwise
-1	@cosmos4u @RussianSpaceWeb I think @NASA uses the right names internally  it's just PAO's misguided attempts to dumb things down for public?
-1	@ShuttleAlmanac What are you complaining about? That capture came at a time when video downlink was unavailable? Not the priority...
1	@elakdawalla @ESA_EDM @MarsRovers If only Oppy had started heading west the day it landed  it'd be almost there now!
1	@UCSSatDB @GWR 13 record with 1993 Mar 14 TM-21 launch  again 93 Feb 11  09 Mar 26  09 Jul 15  09 Aug 29  and 2010 Apr 5.
1	@cosmos4u    :-)
-1	@romn8tr @esascience @NASA @ESA_EDM The white dot at bottom is likely the parachute. The black smear is the impact scar of the lander.
1	@GWR @UCSSatDB @Space_Station I confirm 13 is the record and has been reached on multiple occasions
1	@cosmos4u @Leaving_Orbit I only saw the 'decoding underway' release  is that what you are talking about?
1	@Itzalpean Yes relative timeline also confused. Ideally like to see SCET-UTC to nearest sec for all events starting at entry  planned/actual
1	@esaoperations @esa_edm Sounds like you do know the UTC (or TT) at which LOS occurred  at least to the nearest second - maybe release this?
1	@go_for_launch @ESA_TGO True  I was speaking loosely. 74 deg for Earth sats is often described as polar. It's above the Arctic circle!
-1	@cgbassa @RussianSpaceWeb That would mean TGO was also on wrong traj prior to deflection burn  would have been spotted?
1	@cgbassa @RussianSpaceWeb I think it's really unlikely the entry trajectory was off.
1	@markmccaughrean @AndreaAccomazzo   Just make sure you get some sleep as well...
1	@markmccaughrean @AndreaAccomazzo Mark  Andrea:  thoughts are with you. Looks like it's a tough situation but you have lots of good data.
1	@AuerSusan It says LOS was 50s before  not backshell sep. They've said thruster firing data occurred after backshell sep and before LOS
1	@go_for_launch and to be clear  I really hope I'm wrong and you get a signal in the coming days. Best wishes to all of you working hard
1	@go_for_launch oh  COMPLETELY AGREE. But perhaps there's a difference between what ESA should do (due diligence) and false hope for public
1	@omcintyre Clear from what they've said that it was not at the correct velocity for its altitude  and a correct-speed touchdown didn't occur
1	@Mad_Science_Guy @Summer_Ash That would explain a lot.
1	@RichardFPenn although in this particular case  I do accept the lander was a 90% success. Looks like they have data on all the subsystems
1	@RichardFPenn Yes. Strong tendency to euphemism.
1	@Cosmic_Carol @ESA_TGO @ESA_ExoMars And 40 percent more massive (in dry mass) than MRO  I hadn't realized that - impressive
1	@Skyrocket71 @ArmsControlWonk No  this is a different site well to the north
1	@elakdawalla Do you have up-to-date lat/lon for targeted @ESA_EDM landing site? I have 1.9S 6.1W but suspect you have a more precise value
1	@DexBarton no  we're watching Apocalypse Now I think
1	@DexBarton Maybe follow up with Dr Strangelove?
1	@cosmos4u OK  it's because I apparently don't know how many minutes there are in a day. Stand by for corrected tweet
-1	@cosmos4u @NASAJPL @ESA_TGO OK  so I probably crunched the Horizons data wrong
1	@cosmos4u @ESA_TGO @NASAJPL I'm confused by the 4d period. Possible that's as planned and Horizons data is out of date or I've miscalculated
1	@mikamckinnon This is a big problem. We're hoping to keep @chandraxray working for long time to come because successor not yet funded
1	@SpaceKate Only a couple more years till ubiquitous broadband on planes even in cattle class  I think.
1	@rk70534 Yeah  in retrospect that was harshness for the sake of snark. I apologize.
1	@Simberg_Space @CatherineQ It's the residual Brit in me
1	@AuerSusan I appreciate the 140 char issue.  Doppler shift shift? :-)
-1	@AuerSusan @Fischblog @ESA_EDM Strictly speaking  a discontinuous change in the Doppler shift
1	@carolynporco @UCBerkeley Parking permit? They should require the actual Nobel diploma be pasted to the car windscreen
-1	@astrotweeps Very easy to go from 21K mph to zero when on that trajectory. Tricky feat is to still be intact afterwards.
1	@mirikramer Too soon.
1	@Litsas @CwG_NSF Way too early to conclude that
1	@CwG_NSF yes but did 'as expected' include the correct modelled velocity after parachute slowing  as opposed to just correct time?
1	@upulie Percy Lowell  OTOH...
-1	@upulie I think Schiaparelli gets a bad rap correctly identified some regions;and I think even a few of his "channels" are real (Val Marin?)
1	@jqmcd only if your home is Moskva
1	Castor 30XL stage has separated from the payload  the Cygnus OA-5 cargo ship! Congrats @OrbitalATK
1	@Summer_Ash @aussiastronomer @OrbitalATK  Range safety officer is a woman  judging by the comm
1	Counting down to launch of the 6th @OrbitalATK Antares rocket  and the first of the Antares 230 model which uses 2 Energomash RD-181 engines
1	@SpaceKate @OrbitalATK You are GMT+3? It's 2340 GMT so 02:40am your time
1	@astrolisa Usually it's a 2 day rendezvous  so late Tues?
1	@joannekarma Taylor Wang  payload specialist on STS51B
1	@joannekarma I believe @AstroDude is from Milwaukee.  Lucid  I understand  was the child of missionaries
-1	.@_garywhite_ Good point  I'm not counting Anders since Hong Kong was not China at the time  but it's arguable.
1	The ExoMars @ESA_TGO and @ESA_EDM spacecraft now both 858000 km from Mars and closing. 7½ hours until TGO course change.
1	The Cygnus OA-5 cargo ship now scheduled for launch aboard the first @OrbitalATK Antares 230 rocket at 2340 UTC Oct 17
1	Four @spireglobal Lemur-2 sats are aboard the @NanoRacks NRCSD-E deployer on Cygnus OA-5  according to @Skyrocket71
1	.@megschwamb Yes  a safemode is plausible. There's time to work through recovery before MOI
1	@Cosmic_Carol @NASASpaceflight @_Spacegeek @esa May need TGO to turn back to face Earth before sending confirmation?
1	@tehWKD ok  I installed livestreamer and seems to be working using vlc iff I use the 720p_hls option - thanks!  @esa
1	@RussianSpaceWeb @esaoperations @ESA_EDM @ESA_TGO Last bathroom break before Mars? :-)
1	@ShuttleAlmanac Jing Haipeng  not Hailing  I believe?
1	@PenguinGalaxy If we were talking about Memphis or Thebes  an ethnic Egyptian more plausible  but in Alex I think was mostly Greeks
1	@PenguinGalaxy Yes  but could equally be that they were part of the ethnically Greek pop'n which was most of the Alex upper class
1	@PenguinGalaxy Hmm really cool if true but seems unlikely. Theon is a Greek name  Alexandria a Greek-founded city. I don't think we know.
1	@RocketScient1st Gotcha  thaks. 41797 is the only piece so far in the catalog  appears to be from this event.
-1	@RocketScient1st What was the breakup? I see debris from prev announced Sentinel-1A &amp; SOZ breakups cataloged but what did I miss?
1	@Pillownaut I don't think so... and included afternoon tea at Fortnum's
1	@Pillownaut England! Shropshire  London  Cambridge  Wiltshire...
1	@markmccaughrean so  not on a tiny laptop speaker in a noisy airport departure lounge? (I still like it)
1	@AuerSusan Let's see some hardware.
1	@RegardSurTerre My agents are settting more fires at Vandy as we speak. Don't tell Tory.
1	@themarkashley no  remarkably  *actual* vacation. I'm told people have them so I thought I'd give it a try.
1	@aussiastronomer That is my life goal.
1	@brianweeden @stromgade Ah yes - I corrected it without thinking. Only for the first few elsets  recent ones are right
-1	@brianweeden @stromgade In the sense that A is the rocket and H is the main payload. I don't mind that  I just hate it when they change'em
1	@DownHereOnEarth @AstroKatie Was talking to my local sushi chef today about the possibilities for Europan sushi
1	@DownHereOnEarth @AstroKatie Relevant is the presence on the pressconf panel of https://t.co/2CrfGyjjMU and Bill Sparks from STScI
1	@DownHereOnEarth @AstroKatie If you were @NASA their twitter stream would generally be a lot more fun!
1	@thomassturm No - if you look closely TG2 is at 374 and currently ISS is at 405
1	@NanoRacks Thanks!
1	@NanoRacks so this is NRCSD-10... or -11  or something?
-1	@cosmos4u @SZ damn they found out about my multiple personality disorder...or maybe I am a  clone set
-1	.@FakeAstropix @guardian indeed  as I did note  Tiangong 1's eventual (2017?) reentry could be anywhere between lat 43N and 43S
1	@Robotbeat Elon's been consistent in that being his longterm goal  he's been talking 'multiplanetary species' for many years
1	@FuturamaKing I am working from the press kit and making approximate calculatons based on the incomplete info there
1	@Pillownaut Nice. Have you read the Sharon Kay Penman novels? Wait  I think we may have had this convo already...
1	@Pillownaut Warwick the Kingmaker War of the Roses or Danny De Vito War of the Roses?
-1	@Pillownaut guilty
1	@GlobalEcoGuy @Pillownaut The term 'heliosynchronous' instead of 'sun-synchronous' seems fairly recent  and I'm not used to it yet either
-1	@Pillownaut @GlobalEcoGuy DSCOVR is at L1  which is arguably heliocentric  but a million miles (literally) from heliosync
1	@Pillownaut @GlobalEcoGuy Here's my plot of SSO: active sats in green  Chinese ASAT crud in black https://t.co/meJvz8NBqS
1	@Pillownaut I think @GlobalEcoGuy is confusing heliosynchronous (or sun-sync)  which IS polar orbit  with heliocentric - very different
-1	@AscendingNode Well  they are buying it from France  it's not like they have a domestic capability to build one
1	@SteveShawCA Yes  BX-2 is a small 40cm cube currently stowed in the aft bay of TG-2. It will be ejected later in the mission
1	@DougonTech  Nope. That's for the 2020 station.
-1	@JayAlver Yeah  the actual Chinese story said they were stopping experiments with it  not that they had lost comms. It was ambiguous
1	@JayAlver They were reported as saying that  but if you read the original statement I don't think that's what they actually said.
1	@aiaa @brianweeden Damn  I'm going to get major carpal entering all those into my catalog once the tracking improves
1	@JayAlver I imagine that is TBD. I would be surprised if it ends up only being one.
1	The @NanoRacks NRCSD-9 deployments were completed at 0540 UTC Sep 15 with the deployment of the final two Flock-2e'
1	@NanoRacks probably you mean 18:15:00 CDT?
1	The @planetlabs Flock 2e'-13 and 14 satellites (Doves 0C45 and 0C56) were deployed from the ISS using @NanoRacks NRCSD-9 at 1525 UTC Sep 14
1	@NanoRacks @Space_Station @planetlabs @DovesinSpace Congrats! These were delivered on OA-6  correct?
1	@markmccaughrean @auersusan I'm sure Musk's factory floor is little better  but he's not as famous for it.
1	@markmccaughrean @auersusan The fact that I one-click all my money to the other guy is why I can't afford an MCT berth!
-1	@AuerSusan Especially one famous for the controversial working conditions of their employees.. (admit he gets most of my disposable income!)
1	@DSLauretta Great mission!
1	@rappolee @OSIRISREx @torybruno I would love to have the Centaur post-blowdown OPM
1	@FuturamaKing @OSIRISREx Sun is much heavier than Earth  so balance points are much closer to Earth than Sun (100x)
1	The @OSIRISREx probe will pass about 190000 km from Sun-Earth L1 this evening (0319 UTC Sep 12) on its way out of the Earth-Moon system
1	@ScottWx_TWN @WallaceMarkS @AmericanEclipse Well  it has to be decently bigger than 1LD or the Moon wouldn't stay attached!!
1	@ScottWx_TWN @AmericanEclipse Nice! Good example
1	The @OSIRISREx probe is now beyond the orbit of the Moon  heading outbound...
1	@FuturamaKing @everyEarthquake Only above-ground ones
1	@lyndalovon Correct. Just an event of the right size in the right location. Not confirmed yet  but seems highly likely.
1	@lyndalovon @everyEarthquake https://t.co/R5lmnLltil
1	Congrats to @ulalaunch and @torybruno for giving @OSIRISREx a magnificent sendoff
1	Spacecraft sep! @OSIRISRex and AV-067 separately on hyperbolic trajectories  will leave Earth space (Hill sphere) Sep 12 about 0200UTC
1	@joannekarma and also  I don't think there is a bug in the actual trajectory of O-Rex if that's what you meant? :-)
-1	@joannekarma Yes  bug in the graphic. I take no position on the existence of bugs in reality.
1	The @OSIRISRex space probe is still attached to Centaur; will separate at 0004 UTC
-1	AV-067 and @OSIRISRex orbiting over the Congo prior to the second Centaur burn
-1	@alexwitze Shame on you  one more rocket burn to go
1	Launch of @OSIRISREx panned for 2305 UTC (anyone know if it is exactly 2305:00 ?)
1	Planned orbit for @OSIRISREx is 0.77  x 1.17 AU x 0.2 deg; it will return for an Earth flyby on 2017 Sep 22 before setting course for Bennu
-1	@hvdh16 @Skyrocket71 Yes. I didn't make the NEMESIS/PAN connection then because there was (misleading) evidence PAN wasn't an NRO sat
1	@Robotbeat and of course this is all ignoring the fact that the atmosphere exists
1	@Robotbeat For this and most flights yes  depends on ISS atitude. For TMA-09M I estimated +20 km  so it varies.
1	@Robotbeat I estimate about -30 km but there's some slop on that.
1	@stromgade @Skyrocket71 @CraigCovault Yes I saw this - most interesting
1	@markmccaughrean on request. Since everyone else seemed to be doing it...
1	@EXEDEHARRY @AirbusDS and those kits have the EPC suborb parameters and the launcher number  which the @Arianespace ones don't...
1	@EXEDEHARRY @AirbusDS Yes  that's my point  they STILL haven't put up 232  much less 231...
1	@EXEDEHARRY @Arianespace I don't suppose you know why @AirbusDS hasn't yet posted its VA232 press kit? https://t.co/Wfvn79ky1B
-1	@lorengrush Possibly unclear to them too... better unclear than clear but later discovered to be incorrect  yes?
1	@DJSnM @nyrath I'll take the bars I can clear at this point.
-1	@The_Stargazer I am only talking about failures PRIOR to T=0.
1	@slacka1967 @ZachInFlight Urban legend  well debunked. The cover was pulverized and decelerated in the first few km of altitude
1	@SafeNotAnOption @Robotbeat @Zusiman Yep  just heard SpaceX quoted on WESH 2 news... nothing on web or twitter from them yet
1	@jgeorge @lorengrush Not quite how it works. The other wings are not all space  e.g. 44th Missile Wing was the missile silos in S Dakota
-1	@aussiastronomer No  this wasn't a reused one. Regular new one  during countdown to static fire test
1	@NASASpaceflight I really hope so
1	@sgcsalmon @BIS_spaceflight I still have my copies of all of these! Well-thumbed...
1	@upulie Reminds me of the putative Mars-rock fossil fiasco
1	@upulie oops
1	@emoontx @mikamckinnon Just checked again  the reveal is in chapter 10 of Sporting Chance
1	@emoontx @mikamckinnon (Just happened to reread them last week!)
1	@emoontx @mikamckinnon That was in Sporting Chance  the 2nd of the Heris Serrano tril  though part of the payoff was in next book I think
-1	@FuturamaKing Yep  non-Kep effects can lead to surprising results. Orbital energy  semi-maj axis quite stable; other elements not so much
1	(Talking of orbital decay: tagging @orbital_decay  I think you will like the above series of tweets)
1	@ShuttleAlmanac Yes  it was a cover (I think from one of the newly installed antennae?) that came loose on the recent EVA
1	@Robotbeat @elakdawalla @masequeira1 hard to make omnipotent characters not annoying (as &gt; 2000 years of such stories show)
1	@Spkr2Managers @NASAJuno I think cloud tops. Might be 10 bar level.
1	@SteveShawCA Yes  that's the most likely thing. 2nd guess is something came loose in recent Progress orbit raise.
1	@SteveShawCA Unlikely  that would be suborbital. Looks like it might have come off at least 2 days ago
1	@StephenClark1 Excellent  thanks a million
1	@girlandkat @tomkerss Nice  especially the little dig at the MilFalcon..
-1	@NASAWatch I don't think @ExoCharbonneau thinks interstellar travel is crazy  just the current proposals on how to do it...
1	@pkgw Oops. (Not my department!)
1	Following them comes @ulalaunch with 7   then @arianespace  @roscosmos  CALT/Beijing and SAST/Shanghai with 6 each
1	@davidabatchelor Hmm so is (243) Ida a planet? It has a moon  Dactyl https://t.co/XNwLzBdwXr
1	@Itzalpean Presumably uncertainty in propellant usage due to launch time slips  upper level winds etc?
1	@88n6shi88 Yes  but that doesn't include the nice details like EPC suborb traj that only @AirbusDS launch kit does (This not my 1st rodeo)
1	Flight VA232 probably uses Ariane 5 launch vehicle L586  but I haven't been able to confirm this (@Arianespace @AirbusDS ??)
-1	Ariane launch later this afternoon. Still no 'dossier de vol' online at @AirbusDS website  alas
1	@brianwolven @prgrmr42 yeah  that's another good point
1	@prgrmr42 No  it (like other single dish telescopes) doesn't have the spatial resolution needed - you'd need JVLA or something similar
1	@aschwortz Same with Fomalhaut b  and Sirius B. I think those are legit formal names  on equal footing with Alpha PsA b and Alpha CMa B
1	@JayAlver @ThatNuttyFanboy Not without additional data of some kind
1	@JayAlver @ThatNuttyFanboy Cute idea  but if you can go that far out of plane  just as easy to go there.
1	@pkgw And the 100s of helpdesk questions we've got going 'why can't I make regions anymore' explain why that is the case :-)
-1	@Astro_Wright @pkgw  Yes  sorry about that. It changed about a year ago. It's confusing everyone but worse to change it back again!
1	Here's @cbs_spacenews and @lorengrush on STEREO-B https://t.co/32bCyhNuYF  and https://t.co/AqkvwzSWFY
-1	Can capture history of AGN activity by looking at response of clouds kilo-lightyears from the AGN - @kevinschawinski
1	So @kevinschawinski notes wide dynamic range of timescales in AGN and their host galaxies makes it hard to connect effects
1	Back at CfA the weekly Quasar Tea (can you tell there are a lot of ex Brits in the group?) features @kevinschawinski
1	@NASASpaceflight bummer  ripoff
1	@Bryson_M You should contact @PeterDEdmonds who I am sure can help you out
1	@NASASpaceflight Do they have Prime? Does Amazon provide next day delivery to ISS?
1	@Zerstaubung @genejm29 No  just saying there doesn't seem to be one though capacity is there. Probably nothing suitable to manifest
1	@AscendingNode @dalcantonJD Yes  fair point. You'd have to split off 20% of the time for small annual projects.
1	@NASASpaceflight I remember seeing SSME tests when I was working at MSFC in 1991. Always impressive.
-1	#Chandra10 @martinselvis2 rebuts Kazanas saying alternate (Krongold et al) models also fit
1	@PeterDEdmonds and most of the rest of the community too I think. First really convincing example - based on the Uhuru data IIRC? #Chandra10
1	#Chandra10 @kevinschawinski advocates for deep survey intermediate in size and depth btw CDFS and COSMOS
1	#Chandra10 @kevinschawinski Very few galaxies at z=6 can have formed big black holes.
1	#Chandra10 @kevinschawinski - why haven't we seen the high z massive black holes?  Not seeing X-ray AGN at z&gt;5
1	@kevinschawinski @vrooje Clearly need to start a business where astronomers crossing the ocean act as cash couriers btwn US and modern world
1	@NGC3314 @martinselvis2 Exactly IMHO
1	Paraphrasing @martinselvis2 - decadal competition should be between best balanced programs  not best single missions

-1	@Stephen1424 @themarkashley "For the most part" means "but not if only have Linux boxes". Annoying to buy a Windows or Mac just for this
1	@tracy_karin Yeah the trouble is I'm not great at keeping my mouth shut so I'm happier without a security clearance :-)
1	@tracy_karin That might be overkill but looks interesting. I've been resisting NAS approach till now but I guess I could set up NFS
1	@tracy_karin Nice. The big plus of the seagates is that they were trivial to set up on my linux system. I have a total of 35Tb.
1	@tracy_karin Yes  2x backups thank goodness. I haven't tried Synology.
1	@kevinschawinski I will be at ChandraNextDecade  yes! @PenguinGalaxy
-1	@Stephen1424 @themarkashley No luck mounting. Sigh - I can't stand the extra fake Smartware drive on the WD  but maybe I have to suck it up
-1	@themarkashley OS reports disk serial no then reports sense key h/w error when attempting to spin up. TBH unsure how to crack external case
-1	Thanks all. @cosmos4u I think it's just that my picture was so ugly it broke your browser. You need to adjust its tastefulness settings.
-1	. @cosmos4u Odd. Hey other followers  do you see my avatar ok or is it broken the way it is for Daniel?
1	@cosmos4u How odd  it works for me
1	@cosmos4u @AstroKatie I only wrote two of those. And one was a prelaunch prediction!
-1	@SP_JohnSullivan Not an issue of comfort  just accuracy in reporting (and perhaps understanding WTF the NK were thinking)
1	@datachick Yeah  I would start a ruckus if I had 10 minutes free during business hours to do so...
1	@datachick Friedrich SL36. Only a year old. Got 3 fans running in my apt but far from adequate.. the heat from my computers doesn't help!

1	@dcastelvecchi there are a few articles like https://t.co/mc1ZKhoP4y but my detailed  info was from informal conversations
1	@Skyrocket71 Yes  that is my understanding from folks involved.
1	@themarkashley Units are years. 2016.5 = 2016.50 = halfway through 2016
1	@aschwortz Congrats Andria!
1	@Orangetrees2 Think this is probably unrelated since Louisiana is too far south of the trajectory.
-1	@mikamckinnon too bad. We have a set of trusted outsiders not on team we use for this kind of thing - insiders too vulnerable to groupthink
1	@mikamckinnon so hopefully you have someone you trust doing a 'red-team review' of it...

1	@Pillownaut @astroengine Me too! Today want to flop in front of TV watching the WW movie for 5th time. They need to hurry and make it.
1	@markmccaughrean @chandraxray for Pete Conrad who died a couple weeks earlier.
1	Next up for @chandraxray today is an M dwarf for @pkgw  a magnetar for Vicki Kaspi  and a star forming region for Leisa Townsley.
1	@thomassturm @Robotbeat @jeff_foust Calibration as well as testing. These things never have the same per-pixel spectral response twice
1	@Robotbeat @jeff_foust Probably a lot of tracking down subtle leaks  which takes personnel and time  even in a pure copy
1	@Robotbeat @jeff_foust There is a lot of testing involved in building something that works reliably at subkelvin temps
-1	@themarkashley Sorry  totally lame  I just do it. I will try and be better about posting the fact on twitter

-1	@hubbahubble @ScolesSarah Of course - it shouldn't be on you. My hope in the REU is I spot there's a problem and ask. We all failed you.
-1	@ScolesSarah @hubbahubble Great article. But I feel so bad I didn't spot the stress you were under that summer wish I had been there for you
1	@shanpalus @RachelFeltman I did notice that the equations on the blackboard made more sense than in most movies!
-1	@Robotbeat @KameronHurley  True but suspect those  'quasisatellites' need m &lt;&lt; M and I doubt a naked-eye one would be stable
-1	.@Robotbeat reading @KameronHurley's MirrorEmpire  skeptical of moon's multiyr period...can't stop self trying to make the astrophysics work
1	@mikamckinnon For some of us that's the only version of "from" that we have... thanks for passing on the updates
1	@UCSSatDB Lots of variables - changes in atmospheric density  changes in mission phase  ground station scheduling issues...
-1	@cosmos4u @drspacejunk Certainly 'hurtling' is an exaggeration. It's hurtling around Earth but not towards it.
1	@AscendingNode Mostly just to park in in hibernation and reduce frequency of reboosts  I think
1	@aussiastronomer lol I can see why! Jumps are orbit reboost manuevers...
1	@asrivkin @PlanetDr I guess I can no longer use the excuse that my admin duties get in the way of writing journal papers...
1	@AscendingNode Aren't Kiwis basically a southern hemisphere version of Canadians? :-)
1	@cosmos4u @iceinspace Now compiled to detailed writeup at https://t.co/C99v4pCZXB
-1	@kevinschawinski @joezuntz I am disappointed that this is not in fact an offiical W policy - it should be!
-1	@say_cem @RainerKresken @cosmos4u wrong in the sense that the other Helios is even faster
1	@RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem Oh  apparently someone made SPICE kernels a few years ago https://t.co/nQi568fsvu
1	@RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem Someone has fit elements to the data - I need to crosscheck with mine: https://t.co/zd78ivO8ao
1	@planet4589 @RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem There are positional data at e.g. ftp://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/helios/helios2/traj/hour/
1	@RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem  My source is a file of state vectors from I believe NSSDC circa 1993
1	@planet4589 @RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem Putting it out there to troll someone into doing a better job.
-1	@RainerKresken @cosmos4u @say_cem I'm afraid so. That's what I mean by 'really dumb'. Won't be good on many-year extrapolation.
1	@themadhatter355 In any case  it's not Juno.
1	@themadhatter355 Not clear what initial premise was. If you want 'live probe' record is Helios 1. If you want 'human artifact' it's Helios 2
-1	. @markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASAJuno This seems to be the error: someone just calc'd geo speed of Helios 2 on day of max helio vel
1	. @markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR @NASAJuno .. you don't get geocen record on same day as heliocen record - or even same probe
1	.@markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR @NASAJuno H2 does hold helio speed record in Apr76.  But...
1	. @markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR @NASAJuno Similar graph for Helios 2 https://t.co/qV3nt3R3Ob
1	@RocketScient1st @markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR One claim - the one I am challenging - is geocentric
1	@gtwhitesides In the much shorter term  so will Solar Probe Plus
-1	@KeithMansfield @GWR I should really dig out those letters  I suspect they are in some ancient file folder in my back room
1	@KeithMansfield I think you mean @GWR not @GWRUK. I  contributed to @GWR's space record page when in college  exchanged letters w Norris
-1	. @markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR Here is a version in mph for the metrically impaired https://t.co/i9xZTSjRTF
1	.@markmccaughrean @lauriecantillo @NASA @GWR Here is my calculation showing Helios 1 still the fastest robot ever https://t.co/fVU9ODTDO2
1	. @cosmos4u @say_cem @NASAJuno Orbital elements from an old NASA source  may not be quite right but don't think off enough to matter
1	. @cosmos4u @say_cem @NASAJuno The lower panel shows the angle between the Helios 1 and Earth velocity vectors
1	.@cosmos4u @say_cem @NASAJuno You can see that Juno *does* beat the Apr 1976 peak of Helios 1 but the Dec 1980 peak was much higher
1	.@cosmos4u @say_cem @NASAJuno Here is my calculation showing Helios 1still has the record https://t.co/L9xuFGGR4o
1	@cosmos4u @NASAJuno Actually for the heliocentric record I believe Helios 2 pips Helios 1 due to its slightly lower perihelion
1	@markmccaughrean @esascience Wondered if it might be a French translation thing (dernier = latest OR last)
-1	@NASASpaceflight @CwG_NSF I'm betting I make that mistake at least half a dozen times in the next week
1	@sciam @Hellmanns @ClaraMoskowitz That sandwich is almost bigger than Clara!
-1	@RichardFPenn @cbs_spacenews I guess they aimed it so that Jupiter's gravity slowed it down nearly to capture
1	@RichardFPenn @cbs_spacenews Not even close  only 0.5 km/s. Earth orbit insertion by upper stages much larger.
1	@RachelFeltman I think it's just the approach movie we've already seen?
-1	@geoffryken @ulalaunch (and Galileo orbiter). Yes. Closest non-fatal orbit.
1	@geoffryken @ulalaunch ..err How about the Galileo Probe?
1	@vrooje @merrdiff @AstroKatie Right  I am using actual times in my tweets  but NASA and most others are doing Earth-received
-1	@JPMajor @burritojustice @sondy @elakdawalla @NASAJuno Sorry - not sure. May try and calculate once things slow down...
1	@lorengrush @alexwitze @mikamckinnon @mirikramer @RachelFeltman Time to put on a nice dinner while I think of you all out there
1	@planet4589 @markmccaughrean @NASAJPL Quick analysis using  Horizons ephem suggests max v_rel_geo around 75 km/s at perijove 2
1	@markmccaughrean Fair enough!
1	@planet4589 @shannonmstirone But Helios and Earth orbits not in sync  later perihelia the vel vectors line up differently
1	@shannonmstirone I've confirmed with my calcs that the 165000 appplies to the Mar 1975 first peri when Earth/Helios vel vectors at 90 deg
1	@markmccaughrean @NASAJPL Ah very good question. Jovicentric peri vel a bit less after JOI and PRM. Will investigate.
1	@markmccaughrean I think @nasajpl just checked v-rel on first perihelion and didn't calculate later orbits for better alignments.
1	@markmccaughrean @nasajpl  Trouble is knowing how accurate orbit propagation is after they are no longer tracked but should be good enough
1	@markmccaughrean @nasajpl Fair issue on Helios 2. Helios 1 was still operating in 1985 so its Dec 1980 record is valid on that criterion
1	@markmccaughrean @nasajpl Helios 2's max was only 92.7 km/s on 1982 Nov 24. Still faster than Juno  but not as fast as Helios 1
1	@shannonmstirone On Dec 1980  while still operating  Helios reached 215 000 mph Earth relative. JPL's value only applies to its first orbit
1	.@markmccaughrean @NASAJPL I have redone my calculations and stand by them. In Dec 1980  Helios 1 had an Earth-rel velocity of 96 km/s
1	@markmccaughrean Exactly. The JPL claim was geocentric.  Helios was 60 heliocentric at perihelion so 30 to 90  depending on time of year
-1	.@markmccaughrean Apparently JPL disagrees with me. I am redoing my calculations.
-1	@shannonmstirone I believe they are incorrect - will get back to you
1	@AstroGingerSnap @shannonmstirone me  today https://t.co/3mN49hptI6  ( but at least I am self-aware)
-1	@AstroGingerSnap @shannonmstirone Precisely. I suspect it's exactly that - failure to check the records diligently.
-1	@AstroGingerSnap @shannonmstirone Don't know where it comes from. Helios also solar powered. Suspect they are just wrong.
1	@shannonmstirone No  57 rel to Jupiter  and much smaller than the 96 of Helios 1
1	@shannonmstirone I don't accept this claim - this is Juno's geocentric velocity  61 km/s. On 1980 Dec 5  Helios 1 was at 96.2 km/s Earth-rel
1	@PatchenBarss @mikamckinnon @NASAhistory I guess Grissom's corned beef sandwich is the earliest one I know of...
1	@PatchenBarss @mikamckinnon 8000  payloads in orbit or beyond to date  they are all interesting :-)
1	@PatchenBarss @mikamckinnon My estimate is the figurines are &lt; 0.001 percent of Juno's dry mass
1	@GreeningGalaxy @cosmos4u First time you hear it sure. But as a kid  I got a feel for such things by seeing the numbers in different cases
1	@GreeningGalaxy @cosmos4u And for an astronomer  potentially confusable with Gigayear.
1	@cosmos4u I take care not to stand at the focus of the Chandra mirrors  though  so my dose is fairly low.
-1	@cosmos4u ok  so a rad is just a cenitGray? Pretend I said 250 centiGrays.
1	@cosmos4u Do you know what the dose Juno gets is in Grays?
1	@cosmos4u Just quoting what was said in the press conference - honestly don't know anything about such things.
1	@cwmagee @cosmicpinot @DoctorKarl No  would have been well separated by the time of the observation and in the middle of its reentry descent
-1	@jasonrdavis @kchangnyt Ouch. These things happen... I have seen (and almost perpetrated) similar disasters so I feel for Marc here...
1	@cwmagee @cosmicpinot @DoctorKarl A Progress robot cargo ship left the ISS at 0348 GMT and remained fairly close to it for 3 hours
-1	@ShuttleAlmanac I don't know  I missed it.
-1	@SputnikInt Clearly overmagnified &amp; showing defects of camera lens. Not real structure. Probably star;might be Chinese sat launch that night
1	@DrMRFrancis @Capoglou Agreed
-1	@Capoglou @DrMRFrancis I don't know. NASA folks have been told not to go  I understand. Very unfortunate.
-1	@DrMRFrancis :-( It gets worse and worse. Not going to be good for the COSPAR meeting in July  on top of all its other bad implications
1	@rappolee @torybruno Preferably before it is travelling at the second cosmic velocity  I assume
1	@markmccaughrean @esa_rosetta @aisfranciosi Did you see the library in the Citadel? I want the job as head librarian.
1	@markmccaughrean @esa_rosetta @AisFranciosi Yes  that is typical role. Ian McShane didn't even get a big plot reveal!
1	So  Lyanna Stark costarred with Lord Baelish in the wonderful @esa short https://t.co/QkLpudd20s Ambition h/t @markmccaughrean #GoTFinale
1	@markmccaughrean @ESA_Rosetta I did not spot that Lyanna was Aisling - thank you for pointing that out!
1	@WoodLloydWood @AstroKatie Clearly you just use the side that was closer to the first point of Aries on epoch B1875.0
1	@ShuttleAlmanac Yes thanks - been following chinaspaceflight site for a while
1	The @ULALaunch commentary talking about the waveform a lot without actually saying "it's been a monumental screwup" https://t.co/trAtICF844
1	@ponder68 @ulalaunch Usual MUOS profile is to high perigee GTO  say 3800 x 35780 km
-1	@torybruno @ulalaunch Too bad the data crawl is cut off at the top of the picture so can't see altitude number...
-1	@astrokatey Yeah  sorry about that.
1	@rjmlaird Yeah. And Cornwall's only really been part of England since 1300 or so
1	@rjmlaird The Untied Kingdom.
1	@AscendingNode I probably kept it in business when I was a kid...
1	@cosmos4u @elakdawalla @astro_Liz Not the Boston I'm in  - they "voted" to leave in 1776.
1	@carolynporco The French had London for a while in 1215  maybe it could rejoin them
1	Yay Lambeth! The home of @BIS_Spaceflight votes to remain
1	@astrokatey I think that's very likely. Not immediately  but a couple of years down the road.
-1	@PenguinGalaxy sadfly lost my UK right to vote after more than 15 years abroad without a UK residence. :-(
1	@mirikramer @SarcasticRover The @BIS_spaceflight folks have been attempting that suince the 1930s ;-)
1	@DougonTech Good question  hey @PlanetLabs  how about having @DovesInSpace tweet an "aargh!" on reentry?
1	@NanoRacks still no info on the Cygnus external deploys? At least a deployment date/time?
1	@cosmos4u Yes  I agree  21
1	@vacant3rdman Orbital lifetime needs to increase too if their design cycle no longer so rapid
1	Cygnus OA-6 deployed at least 4 @SpireGlobal cubesats today from the @NanoRacks external deployer - anyone got the deploy time please?
1	@AstroKatie @ZachWeiner @mcnees Interesting question.  Towards the center it may affect things. But it's mostly in primaries perhaps
-1	@AstroKatie @ZachWeiner @mcnees But (for now) other 90% will NOT vote against you just because of the guns issue. So you swing +10 your way.
1	@GeorgeWHerbert @rocketrepreneur @yag1968 @Rand_Simberg @SpcPlcyOnline  GT2 spacecraft reused  but new rocket
1	@yag1968 @GeorgeWHerbert @Rand_Simberg @SpcPlcyOnline Sure it is. Adding wings doesn't stop it being a rocket.
1	@GeorgeWHerbert @Rand_Simberg @SpcPlcyOnline Yes  OK. Good point. Slipped my mind.
-1	@SpcPlcyOnline RSRMs had apogee of about 70 km  in the mesosphere  so can argue NS is first reusable *space* rocket.
1	@Skyrocket71 The story is that Geizer/Potok was also used for the Bankir network but I don't know if that was just partial transponder lease
-1	@Skyrocket71 To be fair  Kupon failed before entering operational service
1	@Skyrocket71 Correct!! A lesson in not believing the satellite owner's press releases for claims of "firsts"...
1	@spaceguy87 @arianecornell maybe she'll actually start using twitter then?
-1	@FakeAstropix @BenjiHND Hard to explain ram pressure in tweet  in my head was extending the concept of friction but in retrospect a bad idea
1	The @NatReconOfc NROL-37 payload has been spotted drifting in GEO over the Indian Ocean as expected https://t.co/xR3gYCUPyR
1	@FakeAstropix OK  fair point. I was speaking too loosely.
1	@cosmos4u @cbs_spacenews Not clear when TsUP's web page was last updated though  could be Bill's numbers are more current.
1	@hubbahubble @ScolesSarah I have no doubt you will be an amazing advisor. And looks like @TheBanneker have a great group.
1	@hubbahubble @TheBanneker @ScolesSarah ∞ ago?? Sigh..  Seems like mere moments ago to me...
1	@cosmos4u Here's a capture of it for your pleasure https://t.co/HALoUBe3y5
1	@cosmos4u Hmm.  well the official TsUP website seems a reasonably primary source to me. I don't get any malware warning on firefox.
1	@orbital_decay  Fab idea! This week is also Sally Ride night too  so we could have Badass Women Astronauts Week.
1	@CubeCheeseBryan @Skyrocket71 Well if you're going to name your sats intruigingly  gotta expect that. Need to update https://t.co/2TXonmodeK
1	@Skyrocket71 oh wait  sometimes a twitter handle gives it away  must be @CubeCheeseBryan :-). "Nate" is a bit more anonymous...
1	@Skyrocket71 So Becca Dewey  Russ Muzzolini and Jordan Bridgeman but don't know who Nate and Cubecheese are!
1	@RichardFPenn a cite to "McDowell  2016" with URL would be appreciated if possible.
1	@RichardFPenn There is a table with the relevant numbers on page 54 of https://t.co/rAkxKTqlOC
1	@lorengrush @SpireGlobal This was PAO on NASA TV just now  I don't think I misheard
-1	@vacant3rdman Question is  can you get a 3-sigma error on the diameters small enough to see if USA250 is   say  20% smaller than USA268?
-1	@Skyrocket71 Further alternative  one can read the budget doc as indicating that N2 was cancelled and never flew (funds zero after 2011)
1	@Skyrocket71 Alternative scenario is that the RS-68A launches 2012/2016 are NEMESIS and the 2014 is the last ORION
1	@Skyrocket71 But I can't figure out which earlier one would be the N1 candidate
1	@Skyrocket71 The Wikileaks names fit better if one of the earlier ORIONs actually NEMESIS 1 and 2014 launch is N2  making this one ORION 8
1	@marsjoe @SpaceJosh @AscendingNode @Simberg_Space Ahh.. thanks  that's good to know.
1	@Skyrocket71 I was wondering if it could be one of the leftover 'Naughty Boeing  we're giving some of your launches to Atlas'
1	@Skyrocket71 I did  although I am reevaluating that.
1	@Rand_Simberg @marsjoe @SpaceJosh @AscendingNode Yes  exactly like that :-)
1	@marsjoe @SpaceJosh @AscendingNode @Simberg_Space But was there ever an RL1 to RL9?
1	@Skyrocket71 I didn't see a release from ULA confirming success  can you point me to it?
1	@smith_randallk @NatReconOfc No  I'm happy for the sensor details to be classified  "ORION 9" would do. And it's "100mRadioDishPointsDown".
1	@SpaceJosh @AscendingNode @Simberg_Space Confirmed in my files that manufacturer consistently uses RL10.
-1	The @NatReconOfc and other US military payloads are registered with the UN with a bland "USA" cover name - this one will be USA 268  I think
-1	@rappolee Probably not. Expect Stage 2 to do depletion burn to sub-GEO orbit.
1	A @ulalaunch Delta 4 Heavy took off from Cape Canaveral's Space Launch Complex 37 at 1751 UTC on the @NatReconOfc Launch 37 mission
1	Today's @ulalaunch Delta IV Heavy launch attempt: @ToryBruno says "arrg" which I think means "scrubbed for today due to weather. "
1	@genejm29 That's a generic D4H GEO mission  not specifically NROL-37 I assume?
1	@NASASpaceflight reason to believe exactly such a deployable umbrella of about that size is hiding under the hood (not sure rainproof tho)
1	@doug_burke @libcce @space_qual @adafruit @SatNOGS I think it belongs on the roof of my car
1	@StefanBarensky @timmermansr I think it's clear @planetlabs have a pretty good basic design.
1	@StefanBarensky @timmermansr @planetlabs That's a *little* unfair (but only a little?) and better than a perfect 20-year design cycle
1	@StefanBarensky @timmermansr @planetlabs That's by design though - low orbit  rapid reentry  Si valley style rapid design cycle improvements
1	Four more @planetlabs 3U cubesats deployed in pairs this evening at 2355 UTC May 31 and 0310 UTC Jun 1 from @nanoracks NRCSD-8.
1	Looks like @NanoRacks deployed another couple  with Flock-2ep No 5 and 6 now in orbit - no deploy time annoucement yet
1	@Space_Alex @aerospatium Oui  semblable au GPS  tant qu'il porte une horloge atomique pour la navigation
1	@tehWKD Thanks  was just going from the Novosti story
1	@SP_JohnSullivan @torybruno @45thSpaceWing My accent is indeed a deep mystery - complex influences
1	@brianweeden It was just after launch. Now it's in 1436 min GEO stationed at 1.0 deg west.
1	@mikeseibert @cirquelar Yeah  I am sort of waiting for the thing to burst apart and all of the pieces float majestically away
1	@VeerabadhranS Communication. Will end up in circular GEO
1	@mirikramer @johnwenz @kchangnyt  not for the first or last time
-1	@cosmos4u @aussiastronomer Too expensive I think; depletion lowers it a bit to shorten life
-1	@OrbitalATK Do you have a more accurate launch mass for #Thaicom 8 than vague 'around 3000 kg'?
1	@cosmos4u @aussiastronomer Currently 6 Falcon 9 second stages junking up geotransfer orbit.
-1	@aussiastronomer It's space junk. If they follow the same profile as last mission  it'll stay in geotransfer orbit and eventually reenter
1	Thaicom 8 has separated from the Falcon 9. Congrats @SpaceX @OrbitalATK and Thaicom
1	@mirikramer @kchangnyt Well not you either of course. I'm digging myself deeper aren't I...
1	@markmccaughrean @e_astronomer believe that is correct
1	Follow @NASASpaceflight for BEAM module expansion updates this morning (I am on travel so can't follow along) https://t.co/swPoODRu4x
1	@cosmos4u boo hiss...
1	@SteveShawCA @kencf0618 @elakdawalla @pallavabagla @Davis_404 Not convincingly. May change soon  but in most areas SpX behind them for now
1	@kencf0618 @elakdawalla @pallavabagla @Davis_404 Top space actors Russia  US  China  Europe; 2nd tier Japan and India  others way behind
1	@NASASpaceflight thought 0130Z was the predicted time per the NOTAM?
1	@NanoRacks Congrats  and question: what happens to the old  empty NRCSDs? Still on ISS  returned on Dragon  or disposed on e.g.Cygnus?
1	@RainerKresken @markmccaughrean Needs to learn something but am still not convinced of a causal funding correlation of human spfl vs robotic
1	@markmccaughrean @ESA I have that one on my fridge. I love the poetic sentiment despite the questionable celestial mechanics.
1	@NanoRacks Thank you for the rapid clarification! @Skyrocket71 @planetlabs @SpireGlobal
1	.@NanoRacks says last 4 sats were @planetlabs Doves but @skyrocket71 thinks they were @spireglobal Lemur-2 sats. Waiting for clarification
1	@Skyrocket71 Interesting; @NanoRacks says they're @dovesinspace + I had thought all Lemurs were on Cyg deployer but your theory makes sense
1	@aussiastronomer @hubbahubble @UW Well said Jessie. Very true.
1	Watching @orbital_decay on NASA TV right now talking orbital debris. Way to go  Lisa!
1	@thomassturm Possible  but they'd have fallen in the ocean.
1	@Skyrocket71 We'll see. Would not be surprised since they prob want to test the newest tech
1	The @nanoracks NRCSD No. 7 has been loaded onto the MPEP ready for the Kibo robot arm to take it outside to pop out a bunch of cubesats
1	@jablan Actually rechecking  NASA statement says 2.51pm EDT which could be right. Others say 2.55pm EDT. 11.31 could be typo for 11.51.
1	@jablan Might be parachute deploy time?
1	@jablan I think NASA repeated SpaceX mistake; one in PDT other reported in EDT. Don't think values can be correct  but maybe I'm confused
1	@omcintyre Yes  and she has a new one coming out soon  I'm very excited.
1	@sparklefingered Mine's an Android but hey...
1	@hubbahubble @EllieInSpace awww fab photo
1	@Skyrocket71 oops - I was sure I did the extraction after adding the new one!!! Thanks
-1	@Skyrocket71 Which one am I missing? https://t.co/8d8oZ3ZGSF
1	@ConnorJ_W @NASASpaceflight No  I think you're confusing it with French 'zilliard'  which is different again.
1	@NASASpaceflight Is that a US zillion or a British zillion?
-1	@lorengrush Me too! That's the trouble with internet virtual launch parties  no way to share snacks...
1	@RonBaalke Really  you had to pick that RDJ travesty?
1	.@JLGalache  Yes @EllieInSpace gave a fabulous talk! Warmest congrats Dr. @EllieInSpace - &amp; great that you'll still be in the area.
-1	@omcintyre (Not trying to be difficult  just not sure what advantage you're seeing here)
1	@omcintyre @wshcrew Which is discarded before Mars entry  so don't see advantage over Atlas V launch? Or direct Falcon 9 launch w/no Dragon?
-1	@omcintyre @wshcrew Don't think it could roll out the hatch. Seems riskier than repeating Curiosity which we know worked.
1	@Cosmic_Carol Just using traditional Douglas Adams units...
1	@Cosmic_Carol HST is also equiv of 1/4  of a surprised sperm whale  or 20 thousand bowls of petunias. Just saying.
-1	@Cosmic_Carol In a battle between 2 elephants and HST  I'm afraid the elephants would win.
-1	@omcintyre Heartbreaking. Gutwrenching.
1	@RussianSpaceWeb TBH I don't understand why this 'first Vostochniy launch' and not '6th launch from Svobodniy recently renamed Vostochniy'
-1	@RussianSpaceWeb Do you have more precise times for the Volga burns?
1	@markmccaughrean @aallan The Space Act agreement implies NASA will swap DSN time for EDL data from the mission.
1	@lorengrush Still  good for NASA for providing DSN support and so on.
-1	@Rand_Simberg @AscendingNode Strongly doubt that applies to this first mission
1	@brianweeden Absoutely. I think it's a very exciting step forward  and will probably happen as soon as 2020 given typical @SpaceX delays
1	@astrocrash I believe the answer is kinda-sorta. @JasonKalirai can amplify...
1	@markmccaughrean Yes  mentioned those further down the stream! Congrats to @ESA__Education and the Torino  Liege and Aalborg teams
1	@e_astronomer @markmccaughrean Other than for angular momentum storage  not as far as I know
1	.@UCSSatDB Extract from what's already in https://t.co/FnSbxLCbW8 - what's new is decoding of serial numbers
1	@wikkit @hhallam Ah ok the turtles were not airborne at the time. My brain is exploding a bit less.
-1	The @NASAKepler mission started science observing again today after its recent recovery from emergency mode. Hooray!
1	@Mad_Science_Guy I think he was special for the US fans in particular  for my gen in UK not so drastically I think
1	@Mad_Science_Guy I do recall Zoe the from-a-future-space-station astrophysicist (played by Wendy Padbury) made big impression on 6yo me
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy @realscientists I would say many of them made the role their own. Too bad so much of Troughton era lost...
1	@realscientists Pertwee (+ Troughton) big factor for me too. Plus fact that all my babysitters were physics grad students #GatewayToScience
1	@DownHereOnEarth certainly no intention to limit the microcanine flux in your feed :-)
1	@DownHereOnEarth not disjoint sets? some of us definitely rather fuzzy. Will try not to be miffed at implication we're not all adorable ;-)

-1	@RocketAcademy @zulfikarabbany @ArmsControlWonk I do worry about transparency  open data - Milner is ok on that front  Musk less so
1	@NASAWatch @lorengrush @sokane1 Total respect for @zacinaction's Sprites. That part is close to being ready.
1	@NASAWatch @lorengrush @sokane1 Don't mean to poo poo. It's very exciting. But worth pointing out where the physics challenges are.
-1	@lorengrush @NASAWatch Oops sorry @sokane1 ! My eyes are glazing over a bit at this stage...
1	@lorengrush @NASAWatch I think Loren's article is spot-on. It's a great project but there are big  big challenges.
-1	@ajebson @lorengrush Yes  they claim they can get low bit rate downlink with optical laser but it's going to be a challenge
1	@lorengrush The true cost is person-hours  ultimately. Redirecting a few of those from defense industry would be good.
-1	.@lorengrush I do worry about the inferred average acceleration of 20 thousand g's. Can the sail survive that?
1	@lorengrush Unclear exactly what the $100M will buy. But I think they can make real progress.
1	@DownHereOnEarth @CatherineQ @DrMRFrancis @Summer_Ash Ah  at least I grew out of *that* fantasy years ago.
1	@CatherineQ @DownHereOnEarth @DrMRFrancis @Summer_Ash Smart  I should probably just do the same
1	@sparklefingered This particular satellite will fire a retrorocket and parachute its experiment samples back down to land in China.
-1	@sparklefingered To counteract the effects of drag  yes. Also possibly to tweak path for better landing opportunities
-1	@DownHereOnEarth @CatherineQ @DrMRFrancis @Summer_Ash Yes  but why does it kick to max the night before an early important meeting/flight?
1	@AstroKatie @tweetsoutloud @brianwolven @ziyatong but of course your main point I am in complete agreement with.
1	@AstroKatie @tweetsoutloud @brianwolven @ziyatong But if reality is that ppl only care/know abt celebs  good if some celebs are scientists.
1	So Bigelow's putting money on reserving an Atlas  + @ulalaunch investing modestly in the supporting engineering. That's a good development.
1	@ulalaunch @BigelowSpace Thanks
1	@JayAlver Sure  I get it. Just important for spacefandom to not get overexcited thinking this is an actual funded mission.
1	@SpaceKate Wow! I'll be very interested to hear how that goes. Good luck.
1	@SpaceKate Where are you moving to?  Save travels!
1	@AscendingNode He sounds like he's making it up as he's speaking though  or am I imagining that?
1	@ulalaunch @tp_1024 @SpaceKSCBlog @BigelowSpace But in general  putting stuff on a live youtube channel would be more portable
1	@ulalaunch @tp_1024 @SpaceKSCBlog @BigelowSpace Yes  have now installed Chrome browser thanks.
1	@AscendingNode @ulalaunch @tp_1024 @SpaceKSCBlog @BigelowSpace Thanks. installing google-chrome-stable... hum hum... ok works now
-1	@ulalaunch @tp_1024 @SpaceKSCBlog @BigelowSpace Also getting that error and unable to watch (Firefox on Linux).
1	@NASASpaceflight But who is putting up the money?
1	@dotMudge @GeertHub @erinleeryan as for non-space  verify fixes on test server before pushing to production server!
1	@dotMudge @GeertHub @erinleeryan Not unique  but the main thing is replicate situation on ground copy of hardware.
1	@dsfpspacefl1ght Ahh interesting. So maybe not so different.
1	@_garywhite_ Interesting  although it doesn't give a primary source. I've been guessing 1000 for the trunk too.
1	.@rocketrepreneur @_garywhite_  Bear in mind Soyuz has the same mass and carries much less cargo.
1	@rocketrepreneur @_garywhite_ Heat shield  elec power  propulsion  recovery system  pressurized cabin - like to see you do it lighter!
1	@GeertHub @erinleeryan This does sounds like an extra-deep safe mode  so less likely fully benign. But certainly too early to panic.
1	. @_garywhite_ Total Dragon mass at launch including cargo is around 10.7 tonnes. Mass without cargo around 7.6 tonnes  that's cabin + trunk
-1	@_garywhite_ No  that just gives cargo masses  no constraint on spacecraft mass
1	@AuerSusan That's my guess  and it's about the right size.
-1	@AuerSusan Correct. And I suspect L is the HXI instrument from the end of the optical bench. Altho' JAXA think  might be solar panel pieces
1	@mwlphelps @BadAstronomer @alexwitze No.
1	@Jillian_Scudder @sondy One of my profs had the chair of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy  and I think that's a cool desc of what we do
1	@Jillian_Scudder @sondy Having said that   I do like the fact that astro was one of the 7 classical lib arts.
1	Elon: used to be a barge but we added engines etc so now it's a ship.  NB @alexwitze :-p
-1	@lorengrush I'm shocked it's not taught in US elementary schools.
1	@Jillian_Scudder @sondy .... Cambridge hasn't changed its paperwork since Whewell invented the word "scientist". So  still "BA". (2/2)
1	@Jillian_Scudder @sondy Very much so. No such thing as a major  you do one subject.  But... (1/2)
-1	@astrotweeps Don't think they've ever broken down the delta-V for the three return burns. Decelerating hard for sure.
1	@Jillian_Scudder @sondy I have a BA in Maths  all Cambridge degrees were BA (even Engineering I think??)
1	@prgrmr42 199 IIRC
-1	@Simberg_Space and they learnt a lot of propulsion from ground static tests. Not saying unimportant  just uninteresting to *me*.
1	@Simberg_Space No  that's just a toy :-). Well  it doesn't leave the troposphere  so not the same thing at all.
1	@sandentotten 6 if you count CRS-7 which blew up before beginning the boostback
-1	@RocketScient1st @SpaceX It is important  and it annoys me that launch 'casts often don't talk about it :-)
1	@DougonIPComm Very good point
1	@alexwitze :-p
1	@planet4589 @AstroKatie @tweetsoutloud @SarcasticRover I mean  lasers are provocative enough. Typical American diplomacy...
-1	@AstroKatie @tweetsoutloud I'm hoping you mean RTG. I didn't realize @SarcasticRover had RPGs; no wonder the Martians are scared of it
1	@spacecom 0 Million? Are you sure that shouldn't read 0 Billion?
1	@johannateske @penn_state @hubbahubble  true + quite a few of them awesome SAO REU alums  :-)
1	@sparklefingered radars and some AirForce optical telescopes. But indepedent observers with binoculars give us orbits for the secret AF sats
1	@astrokatey @MJIBrown :-) :-) Thank you...
1	@mirikramer It does seem the obvious question. Also  if their jackets are simulations  can they open-source the code for them?
1	@mirikramer wow :-) Cool  man.
1	Congrats @AmyMainzer  https://t.co/VnqJcymLSl
1	@_starbase_ wherever  depending on fluctuations in the density of the atmosphere
1	@lexcalibur100 @rappolee @spaceguy87 @elakdawalla You kids and your apps...
1	@lexcalibur100 @rappolee @spaceguy87 @elakdawalla https://t.co/stWEA2SG00
1	@rappolee @elakdawalla Major launches now at Tanegashima rather than Uchinoura/Kagoshima
1	@spaceguy87 @elakdawalla Apparently flaring to mag -2 tonight.
1	@spaceguy87 @elakdawalla Possible  yes. Without time  RA  Dec can't be sure.
-1	@OldCrank Yes  they are flashing to very bright magnitudes. Alas I am too far north to look for them (max 31 deg)
1	@rappolee @NsightI @RonBaalke @NASAJuno @CassiniSaturn As long as they put the Centaur data in JPL Horizons I'm happy
-1	@vacant3rdman Strictly speaking there was the Endeavour GAS payload in the Shuttle STS-67 payload bay.
1	@vacant3rdman fair point
-1	@markmccaughrean  ... I still feel that 'all eggs in one basket' is a bad strategy for this or any other discipline  however golden the eggs
1	@markmccaughrean And indeed some very good friends are on the JWST science team  they are the best and have all my respect. But..
-1	@markmccaughrean Travelling sucks these days anyway.
1	@davehuntsman @Rand_Simberg @PaulFDietz @SciGuySpace Don't care whose control.Arianespace as good as US   not going on some cutrate Rus ICBM
1	@SciGuySpace Nothing I haven't been saying for 15 years.
1	@SciGuySpace @NGC3314 Because it is tumbling and different parts of it are catching the Sun (maybe a flat surface like a solar panel)
1	@aschwortz Let me know the next time you're in the vicinity and up for lunch...
-1	@aschwortz Yes that was very probably me! Sorry I didn't spot you.
1	@cosmos4u @blueorigin Good catch!!
1	@cosmos4u @blueorigin I infer from capsule markings that same CC flew on all 4 New Shepard launches.
1	@cosmos4u @blueorigin Good question. Based on previous flights  capsule and rocket apogee &lt; 1 km apart.
1	@NGC3314 Yeah  so that's 41337. Until a couple days ago you were looking at 41442 so that's why it looks different
1	@NGC3314 This is the current object A  41337  yes?
-1	@LilyRex @NASAWatch @mansharamani will have to put further snark on hold while I watch batfleck punch superglum for a while
-1	@NASAWatch @mansharamani I am shocked that you didn't already
-1	@NASAWatch @mansharamani .. just to say that any one analysis  no matter how authoritative  will have arguable (not wrong) assumptions
1	@NASAWatch @mansharamani Ah OK. Fair enough. There's also question of how much of basic center costs should be charged for this analysis
1	@NASAWatch @mansharamani Not sure that includes costs of Shuttle program - which was essentially dedicated to ISS during assembly
1	@DownHereOnEarth Yep  that was exactly my reaction when I saw the new data. Hoping against hope that there's something I'm misunderstanding!
1	@AuerSusan Nice job.
1	@markmccaughrean @esa_tgo Could just be thermal insulation or something  that had no impact on telemetry etc
-1	@markmccaughrean @esa_tgo I don't think tank would still be in view at the time of the obsns. And 4 burns is par for course for Briz! But OK
-1	@markmccaughrean @esa_tgo ... and no details of actual timing  magnitude of post sep burns. So I don't think this puts issue to rest.
1	@markmccaughrean @esa_tgo Interesting - "the day was 'neprostoy'" implies maybe not all to plan. No explanation of the observed objects...
1	@redplanet00 @markmccaughrean @ESA_Rosetta Fred  I want to preorder them on Amazon right now!
1	@sondy excellent portmanteau of 'limelight' and 'lifetime'! "Sondy is a legend in her own limetime". Should get it into dictionaries.
1	@alexseiji @astrolisa @JAXA_jp Absolutely. That is the aim. If JAXA can successfully contact it  that's what they will try to do.
1	@alexseiji @astrolisa @JAXA_jp It's definitely tumbling
1	@_garywhite_ Yeah the high rates are leading me in that direction
1	@sparklefingered What kind of data do you need? Catalog of debris objects on my site at https://t.co/lAoxd53TgY
1	@sparklefingered @CanberraDSN Have a job already  as long as Chandra doesn't do a Hitomi. But thanks.
1	@elakdawalla @tweetsoutloud @Rileah Yay  awesome team!  Lucky @astrokatie. 1 of these days really am going to have to meet the rest of you.
-1	.@_garywhite_ Awesome. Scary large Jonathan. I just saw myself on the repeat. A bit frightening!
1	@sparklefingered @CanberraDSN Nope  I'm talking about JAXA's station at Mingenew near Perth
1	. @b0yle Can't argue against any of the ones above me  everyone should follow them
-1	@DarrenBaskill @Pharaoness @elakdawalla Yes  still a very bad situation. But better than no signal at all.
1	@astrolisa @JAXA_jp A few pieces flaked off. It's still mostly in one piece. Obviously the bits that came off were not fatal.
1	@slacka1967 @JointSpaceOps There are such facilities. Not clear if Japanese have requested US use them.
-1	@brianwolven @LarsTheWanderer @lukedones Won't be in DC area until about 3 weeks from now  sorry!
-1	@LarsTheWanderer @lukedones I suspect more probably an internal event.
1	@JudgeWen @AsteroidEnergy @SpaceTrackOrg  No. There are now 6 consistent element sets in the lower orbit.
1	@AstroKatie @JossBlandHawtho @jbprime So I should multiply by 0.26 to get Omega-BH which is what I think in.
1	@planet4589 @AstroKatie @jbprime @JossBlandHawtho Oh wait I remember - Omega(DM in BH) over Omega(DM total)
1	@AstroKatie @jbprime @JossBlandHawtho Thanks Katie - what is "DM fraction" in this? Omega-DM over Omega-nonLambda?
1	@jbprime @JossBlandHawtho I worked with Bernard Carr on that stuff - see McDowell (1986)! Curious too what the best current limits are.
1	@RainerKresken @AuerSusan @SpaceTrackOrg I do. Seems consistent with some venting.
1	@rappolee Mostly  yes
-1	.@RabAusten A debris strike is possible  but given the timing during spacecraft commissioning I think an onboard event much more likely
-1	@starstryder We do work quite hard to try and avoid it!
1	@morfca yes
-1	@starstryder If you release sufficient energy within the satellite  that will happen. (battery explosion  cryo overpressure...)
1	@chrisenorth I agree with your estimate.
-1	@jqmcd Ah  so I must have known you? The memory  it's having bit errors these days... I arrived '88 as a postdoc.
1	@jqmcd Ooh  love ARTEMIS too. I might hit you up for an archive of their lunar orbital ephemerides at some point for the historical record
1	@jqmcd Ah  that's what you do? NuSTAR rocks. Please drive safely! :-)
1	@sparklefingered Overall space astron's had a pretty good record. As we always say in this business  space is hard. Now and again you lose.
1	@Litsas Yes  or possibly cryo system overpressure
1	@robcarrphoto @PeterDEdmonds It's on https://t.co/8WzZEGbHgW but you need an account
1	@PeterDEdmonds I retract my earlier optimism now that we know there is debris
1	@PeterDEdmonds Not good. But it sounds like the sat isn't totally dead  so let's hope it's a fixable software issue...
1	.@phi48 Yes  but you have to get Cygnus to that slow relative speed  starting from an Earth-fixed launch pad. That's impressive.
1	@vacant3rdman Indeed  time  place  *and* velocity. (If only first two  what you have is an ASAT).
1	@vacant3rdman Yes of course I didn't specify rest frame! But given started at a geo-fixed launch pad  fair way to point out precision needed
1	@squaregoldfish @markmccaughrean Are you sure they didn't stow away on Philae? Would explain why 67P wasn't so welcoming to it.
1	@cosmos4u Yeah  I'm assuming. So means different things for different approaches.
-1	Unfortunately latest TLE for Cygnus on @SpaceTrackOrg is 24 hours old; however @NASASpaceflight reports rendezvous is proceeding per plan
1	@Pillownaut Sigh.
1	@PeterDEdmonds @alexwitze  Best-done major science press conf I've seen. Hadn't realized the awesome @whitnutt was behind it! Whitney FTW.
-1	@me_too Well you have to bring the oxidizer with you - explosion is mostly just very fast burning  if can burn things you can explode them
-1	@RussianSpaceWeb @rappolee @NASAWatch Don't get me wrong  "Explosion" is definitely one of the likely possibilities
1	@jqmcd Final stages for all probes in your list except Cassini  which wasn't direct to Jupiter
1	@RussianSpaceWeb @rappolee @NASAWatch 'Explosion' implies the pieces ejected with significant KE  we don't have trajec data to show that
-1	@RussianSpaceWeb @rappolee @NASAWatch Could be insulation pieces  chunks of ice  or a non-violent disintegration.
-1	@rappolee @RussianSpaceWeb @NASAWatch "obvious that ..had exploded" Exploded is a strong word. Can shed debris without exploding
1	@jqmcd Fair point
1	@bigunderscorec @AstroKatie @blakestacey No no no  we're #scicomm astronomers  promise our best not to confuse you more than we already are
1	@DrMRFrancis @AstroKatie @blakestacey Let me know if you visit Boston and we'll totally do a tweetup.
1	@RocketScient1st @OrbitalATK Would be excellent to get the delivered-to-ISS cargo and the rest separately at some point
1	The @OrbitalATK OA-6 Cygnus carries 3395 kg of cargo - not clear to me if that includes the post-undocking cargo of Sapphire and NRCSD
1	@Pillownaut "dog-leg". Means changing left-right direction as it heads up the coast. Does not involve making puddles though
1	The @OrbitalATK Cygnus OA-6 cargo ship is counting down to launch aboard @ulalaunch Atlas AV-064 at Cape Canaveral
1	@lorengrush ... waves hand.... meeeee!
1	After completing its docked mission at ISS  OA-6 will use an external @NanoRacks deployer to eject five cubesats  prob. @SpireGlobal Lemurs
-1	@rappolee @jeff_foust @cristinepulliam Hard to tell. Could just be pieces of insulation or even chunks of ice. Or it could be a bad thing
1	@JayAlverYeah  I am not sure either. Maybe @planetlabs or @OrbitalATK can comment on OA-4 cubesat payloads?
1	@JayAlver There are at least 18 @PlanetLabs Flock-2d  maybe 20?
1	@brianweeden Clearly the correct solution is to mount your workstation on a treadmill
-1	@rappolee @ms_doxie Briz-M 'burial orbit' is still heliocentric. Just misses Mars by a long way
1	@rappolee @ms_doxie Yes  it's heading into solar orbit.
-1	@bigunderscorec Several reasons. I think 80 is closer to a realistic lower limit for space. Need to finish the paper where I argue this!
1	@NuclearAnthro @drspacejunk @vacant3rdman TRAAC was the first ever gravity-gradient boom test  by the way
1	@NuclearAnthro @drspacejunk @vacant3rdman TRAAC was Transit Research And Attitude Control  sat was a side project in Transit navsat program
1	@vacant3rdman @drspacejunk @NuclearAnthro Just went to a talk by a LosAlamos guy who loved NERVA but wants to do fusion rockets.
1	@rappolee @ms_doxie Yes  the 3rd stage stays in orbit. But it's a big empty can with lots of drag so it reenters in like 2 days or so
1	.@PeterDEdmonds I already switched it off following   https://t.co/RIc5olBR3q  Tweetdeck isn't affected I think.
1	@DownHereOnEarth @keiranrowell I'm a quasar guy not planetary sci  tho I've dabbled in asteroids. For me  Pluto's a world but not a planet
1	@shaka_lulu I'm sure everyone would have know what you *meant*!
1	@shaka_lulu That should read "isn't JUST an astronomer" of course - @hannah_jc is an excellent one!
1	@NuclearAnthro @vacant3rdman @drspacejunk Oral historians should come chat to Fred Seward here  among others
-1	@vacant3rdman @NuclearAnthro @drspacejunk Indeed. I actually know some of the people who were involved in STARFISH PRIME. Crazy stories.
1	@drspacejunk technically  grasshopper neuroblasts. To study radiation effects. Why  I have absolutely not the glimmer of an idea.
-1	@drspacejunk Also found a 1961 suborbital shot with grasshopper brain tissue. +lots of "simulated human tissue" (not brain)(w'ever that is)
1	@drspacejunk Not aware of that. Apollo 17 had a study of radiation effects on mouse brain tissue.
-1	@markmccaughrean although I did keep waiting for Baelish to do something evil!
1	@markmccaughrean @PlatigeImage Everyone here at Harvard/CfA was in awe. We had a special showing in the auditorium.
1	@markmccaughrean @esa_rosetta True. In particular  "Ambition" was just fabulous. And the various ESA blogs have some very good stuff.
-1	@markmccaughrean Understood. Shame that ESA gets so little public credit for what it does compared to NASA.
1	@markmccaughrean while I'm at it  for arrival kit I'll lobby again for separate backshell  frontshell masses..for my 'objects on Mars' list!
1	@markmccaughrean Fair enough. I do feel press kits had 10x more tech detail back in the '70s though!
1	@markmccaughrean Nice job on the launch webcast by the way!
1	@markmccaughrean  And this is the sort of info that should be in the press kit  I shouldn't have to dig it out of the state vectors
1	@AscendingNode Good point
1	@VeerabadhranS Pretty pictures are not my area of expertise - you want to check out @russianspaceweb who has some great ones
1	@DrVonBraun @spacecom Shouldn't that be "EtTuFaba?" (if I have the vocative case correct...)
-1	@arielwaldman @BasilLeaf I don't know... that's about a minute in round trip radio-signal travel time  1-digit-off clock error?
1	@mrbeamjockey @VaticanObserv @DrStuClark @VanHyningV Would be nicer yet if the generic 'nuns' didn't erase their names as individuals
1	@megschwamb @astrotweeps Not really  they have been holding events like this since Giotto in 1985. Their funding depends on VIPs not public
1	.@DrStuClark I would love to learn more about Annie Russell and other English analogs of the Harvard Computers
1	@DrStuClark @HughO2 Could be usefully stolen - I mean recycled - today  e.g. to apply to a prominent politician here
1	@DrStuClark hope you saw I credited you in the next tweet (couldn't fit in 140 chars!). Nearly finished SunKings  enjoying much!
-1	@hhallam @RussianSpaceWeb The little SOZ ullage engines make two burns  presumably similar to the usual ones for GEO missions.
-1	@elakdawalla @uhf_satcom I just took the drop tank TLEs and I added enough delta-V to get the right energy-at-infinity.
1	(@RussianSpaceWeb  others: what is the difference between Briz-M 885xx and 995xx? Design? Factory?...)
1	@jtskowronek @cgbassa @RussianSpaceWeb :-) No  NL = Netherlands !!
-1	@slacka1967 @go_for_launch Burn increases the velocity to 10.7 or so. The drop will happen over next few days as it coasts out.
1	@go_for_launch aaah  gotcha. That was my problem. Thanks.
1	Per correction from @go_for_launch  the geocentric inertial velocity of ExoMars drops to 3.712 km/s as it enters solar orbit
1	@go_for_launch Ah  thanks. The C3 I saw must have been an old value.
1	@RussianSpaceWeb They cataloged it as object C which implies they think it's the tank. But the payload's in a very similar orbit - for now!
1	@beatgr @AscendingNode So wish I had saved my punch card stacks!
1	@AdeptInvention @Cosmic_Carol was intended as Fortran77  I've never coded in VHDL!
1	@beatgr @AscendingNode I remember WATFIV! And F66 before that  in middle school in 1973
1	@AscendingNode Also  I can't stop myself from trying to figure out how I would actually pass the orbit data using COMMON
1	@AscendingNode I wondered who would be the first to pick up on that. But F77 is still the best computer language ever. :-p
1	@go_for_launch  Good luck for the final burn! Some friends want to try and track Briz signal  do you have predicted post-burn state vector?
1	@AscendingNode Doesn't quite have the same poetic ring...

1	Good luck to @lycrageek / @FireballsSky and my other legend colleague @lisaharveysmith for the #Eureka16 !! https://t.co/ZUilRKeIkJ
1	@tcortellesi my understanding was it was too close to be anything other than tidally locked but direct imaging should tell us either way :)
-1	@tcortellesi sadly the atmosphere is in no way guaranteed. Dwarf stars are highly active and megaflares can strip the planet's atmosphere
1	@strom_m I know right?! But my honeymoon takes preference so I'll just sit back and enjoy the excitement
1	@PatriciaKimtia @eurekaprizes @Swinburne thank you!!

1	@MJIBrown definitely although don't know when that will be!
1	@MJIBrown @NASA thanks!
1	@michaelaye @MarsMaven @abc15 wow that was a solid guess by me :)
-1	@Cosmic_Horizons @cosmos4u yes this tension has been known for years but the explanation that it's dark radiation during CMB is a big call
1	@Hellionworks @sandygrains @HUBBLE_space they wouldn't have any noticeable effect on us now as universe has expanded reducing their density
1	@Hellionworks @sandygrains @HUBBLE_space more research. For now it's tantalising and HINTS there's a new type of particle out there
1	Finally on @BreakfastNews make sure to look for #Mars in eastern sky after sunset- closest point to us in over a decade so bigger &amp; brighter
1	Glycine is an artificial sweetener so the discovery of key ingredients for life found in space is tasty as well as amazing @BreakfastNews
1	Huge finding of glycine  an amino acid used by life  by @ESA_Rosetta on #Comet67P @BreakfastNews https://t.co/6g3sv0QeeN

1	@mrbenjaminlaw @upulie I'm now getting a restraining order
1	Best way to start a week  chatting #space on @BreakfastNews https://t.co/o20swn82EP
1	My article for @ConversationEDU on the shifting magnetic poles on @BreakfastNews https://t.co/6ZPbVFEXeL
-1	As the Sun was dimmer in its youth we thought the atmosphere would be thicker to trap heat &amp; stop Earth freezing @BreakfastNews
1	Next on @BreakfastNews was a surprise discovery that the young Earth's atmosphere was far thinner than it is today https://t.co/nLjUdzEVHo
1	At current rates in a few centuries your compass will point South instead of North  but Earth will still spin as normal @BreakfastNews
1	A longer term change in our magnetic field is that the north and south magnetic poles are flipping! https://t.co/lPOpWx0cQ1 @BreakfastNews
1	The pulses in the field are directly tied to changes of the molten iron 3000km below our feet @BreakfastNews
1	On @BreakfastNews I explained @esa #Swarm satellites seeing rapid changes in Earth's magnetic field- its heartbeat https://t.co/OHta6bu8vo

1	@Tim_O_Brien @NASAKepler VERY hopeful ;) I'd settle for getting to Alpha Centauri!
-1	The @NASAKepler discoveries are all over 1000 light years away so sadly we won't ever get to travel there to see the new planets
1	nice work @strom_m &amp; @BridieSmith definitely showing #innovation with that story link :)
-1	By doubling its previous haul of alien worlds @NASAKepler has confirmed that planets are common in our Milky Way with billions out there
1	Potentially another 1327 worlds seen by @NASAKepler but not quite at 99% certainty to claim it https://t.co/XqdFhvBOES
1	Impressive increase in number of worlds discovered @NASAKepler (seen blue to orange) note big planets easier to see https://t.co/nk18JaaKMS
1	New techniques to rapidly &amp; efficiently remove false positives (ie light dimming not by planet) doubled tally of worlds found by @NASAKepler
-1	A planet is 'seen' by @NASAKepler as it passes between star &amp; us blocking light just like #MercuryTransit -&gt;bigger planet blocks more light
1	@ErinVincent1 @mjrowland68 @LaTrioli @BreakfastNews @abcnews @ABCTV @ABCNews24 good luck team! :)
1	@ClearSkiesTV @Aus_ScienceWeek @Astroguyz @AstronomyNow @sydneyobs exceptional work all! Much better than my inner city view!! :)

1	@MerrickPhillip hmmm I've seen timelapses work so worth a go but as they last a second or so you probably have to do a composite
1	@MerrickPhillip towards the east but it's not critical as they can come from any direction
1	@AunatEridu @lisaharveysmith that's huge!! Great work Lisa and #ASKAP team too!
1	@jegpeek @Dropbox I do :) and Google drive and time machine. I just don't have a spare computer to access them!!

1	@AunatEridu thanks David!
1	@mjrowland68 @BreakfastNews it was always in the stars as we're both Aries.
1	@kumitaguchi :) thanks Kumi!
1	@cellini8889 @MRsalakas @GruntledChalkie @Doctor_Harves @BillNye @Hobson_k that's amazing!
1	@Tim_O_Brien thanks Tim :) definitely a moment I'll never forget..!
1	@dd9000 wow that's a lot of emojis! thanks :)
1	@bencubby :) thanks Ben
1	@Helen_E_MC haha thanks I reckon you're right!
1	@AusAndgie7 @esa @social4space @AstroKatie @CSIRO_ATNF :) this time is super fun deciding on the new next generation radio receivers..!!
1	@AusAndgie7 @esa @social4space @AstroKatie rats! I'll be discussing Australia's other radio facilities at @CSIRO_ATNF in Sydney then!
1	Great summer effort on @BreakfastNews by @paulwkennedy @albericie Welcome back @mjrowland68 @LaTrioli looking forward to some puns in 2016!
1	.@DJobling welcome back @LaTrioli we've missed you on @BreakfastNews :)
1	@PlaneTalking @upulie @AstroKatie @MBObservatory @whereisdaz @scienceinpublic I think that's correct to nominate yes
1	Where do I start? @upulie @AstroKatie @MBObservatory @whereisdaz for starters! @scienceinpublic may know more too? https://t.co/o0bOFZ5sWE
1	@MihoJnvr it's Melbourne fashion statement these days :)
1	@Cosmic_Horizons @brendonbrewer @flintoff11 @TheProjectV he's seen too many planetX claims. That and I stuffed up a cricketing metaphor.
-1	@DRG_physics ah :( I thought that was suitably faint
1	@DRG_physics not impossibly so (~22mag or so perhaps) but definitely hard
1	@AlanAlanmoret @ABCNews24 maybe. Prediction looks intriguing but I'll believe it when I see it in the telescope
-1	@Tina__Garrett @abcnews likely Mercury hadn't risen yet  it's going to be tough catching it just after its above horizon but before sunrise
1	@astronomyblog I agree :) thanks to Russell Grant alignment is probably the most known term which is why it's getting used for arrangement
1	@astronomyblog I would be happy with arrangement
-1	@astronomyblog 2/2 where the alignment is creeping in but it makes it sound more technical I guess? Not the worst astro misuse I've seen :S
1	@astronomyblog I've been trying to point out that these planets form a line in the sky because we all lie on the same plane  not sure 1/2
1	@Tina__Garrett @Swinburne yes that will be near Mars  fittingly :) it's got a reddish tinge to it
1	@ProfAstroSarah @ThingsWork @JontiHorner will do!
1	@davidjseibuhr @BreakfastNews @abcnews the breakthrough listen project in particular..!
1	@AunatEridu @lisaharveysmith @smh @WorldSciFest impressive timescale!
-1	@Theodore_Bear @paulwkennedy @albericie @abcnews @BreakfastNews @HashtagCuteness sadly my expertise in physics/astrophysics is no help here
1	@jegpeek @kathrynpeek that's a disturbing gift. Glad it's been used for non-nefarious purposes...
1	@MPakakis @Swinburne congrats!!
1	@Theodore_Bear thanks! I think the same about the heroes up from 2am to deliver news like @paulwkennedy @albericie @abcnews @BreakfastNews
1	@Janet_Morris_ never too late to learn! There's online astronomy courses I can recommend at @Swinburne https://t.co/dkLIVo9swU

1	@GruntledChalkie @theprojecttv thanks mate!
1	@Helen_E_MC wow. Go you!
-1	@brendonbrewer @SamHarrisOrg @charliepick sorry to rub it in! Maybe @thinkincAU can do a tour to our neighbours in future..? :)

1	@GruntledChalkie @astro_timpeake amazingly so!!
1	@upulie @Mandford @AstroKatie it'll be interesting to see who gets the gongs.
1	@AstroKatie @upulie @Mandford any idea how these scicomm'ers were picked?
-1	@jehankanga @MJIBrown I would have struggled but reckon 200 words could have done some justice to the time lord
1	@CosmicRami @AstroKatie @drspacejunk @upulie love the look! Happy scientific festive greetings to you all :)
1	@mirikramer a huge night :) I can't wait to see how the refirb costings work out but definitely the beginnings of a new era in space age
1	@danielporter731 @CosmosMagazine @Swinburne nice

1	@JackieSlav @Swinburne absolutely! It sounds like a fantastic project  let's try and get it started in 2016!
1	@drarnakarick nah this one is spot on
1	@dark_cypher @BreakfastNews @mjrowland68 just happened to have one spare in the wardrobe
1	Hey @BreakfastNews I hope Zak gives #ForceAwakens the thumbs up  from my PoV it was epic! @mjrowland68 will be happy for sure
1	@strom_m yes but only because I didn't make her watch episode I
1	@scottdbevan @kumitaguchi well I managed to see a couple and wished on them that next year there's zero cloud so let's hope that works ;)
-1	@pfwaus @scottdbevan @kumitaguchi was there anywhere in Australia that didn't get clouded?! I swear I'm jinxing these Astro events
1	I hope Sydney had less clouds than Melbourne last night! Hey @scottdbevan @kumitaguchi any luck with catching the #meteorshower ?
-1	@MelanieBagg @ABCNews24 ditto :(
1	@upulie go on be honest  weren't you impressed that things growing on minutes-hours timescales care about days? ;)
1	@DClaphamFRAS @Swinburne worth seeing! ;)
1	@DClaphamFRAS @Swinburne yeah it's never that great a meteor shower for us
-1	@AunatEridu arghhh! 120 per hour!! Thanks for noticing that
1	@Contessa29er @abcnews it was always the least likely (just very cool) option :)
1	@CosmicRami @upulie @AstroKatie @drspacejunk @NASA_Dawn entirely appropriate.
-1	@CosmicRami @upulie @AstroKatie @drspacejunk @NASA_Dawn I don't like to gloat (well that's not totally true) but I called it.

1	@robandart not off the top of my head but this is an interesting discussion https://t.co/FwAr5pNClQ
1	@robandart absolutely! An entire field of science / visual art devoted to visualisation &amp; datascience-creatively portraying complex results
1	@robandart thanks for letting me know!
-1	@robandart weird! Thanks for letting me know  I’ve tried retweeting it?
1	My thoughts on @ABCNews24 @BreakfastNews about the Government’s upcoming #innovation policy &amp; space this week https://t.co/ROEqmTTdwx
1	Also on @BreakfastNews wanted to mention @esa's amazing weightloss finding for massive stars https://t.co/h09tiVy2hI https://t.co/YlLsJYYiB7

-1	@CityDwellerMelb @Swinburne @CSIRO_ATNF @lisaharveysmith sorry it's not but I'll try and get future public talks broadcast..!
1	Full house at @Swinburne to hear @CSIRO_ATNF's @lisaharveysmith talk on the largest telescope ever conceived-the SKA https://t.co/XNibCp0ci6
1	@kimtairi @Swinburne thanks for being such an attentive audience! Always so much fun chatting to your crew!!
1	@kumitaguchi @scottdbevan @abcnews my pleasure although technically it's @NASA we should thank ;)
1	~100m similar craters on world 5x area of Oz finding #Apollo16 crater was the ultimate "Where's Waldo?" @kumitaguchi @scottdbevan @abcnews
1	#Apollo16 also left behind astronaut Charlie Duke's family portrait @kumitaguchi @scottdbevan @abcnews https://t.co/BIdZrBH2WT

1	Proud of my fellow @Swinburne astronomers Alistair &amp; Giulia ft in @arc_gov_au annual report! https://t.co/MdUYNzcOfu https://t.co/6emC6Sq6ER
1	Learning about social media and science at @Swinburne from @thesocialsci &amp; look at the textbook example! @AstroKatie https://t.co/FLUiwKTx8Q
1	@MorphyMagic @jmmelican add Apple Watch mark 5 to that too
-1	Learning about the (many many) horrible ways the world could end from @upulie at #Interrobang https://t.co/wD6zMjmLo1
1	@AndySHastings @upulie this should be an official state holiday
1	@askinterrobang @leaantigny @mrbenjaminlaw @upulie I'm offended I won when clearly my panellists were more incredible &amp; intelligent &amp; pretty
-1	@AstroKatie @redrummy gasp! You said you thought the bowties were cool :( unlike @upulie who legitimately has always hated them
-1	@AusAndgie7 I know and we should chat about it on Sunday but it's critically important for investors in US registered space industries
1	@mrcbqn @astrotweeps it's a fair point but it's also extremely relevant for investors of those US registered space industries
1	Learning about crowdfunding in science at @Swinburne by one of the experts in this space @DrMel_T! https://t.co/q5x4enVQgI
1	@cosmos4u @PedroTGFerreira fantastic!! A primary source to finally get to the bottom of it  great find!
1	@cosmos4u @PedroTGFerreira yes when I re-read that and realised what you meant I deleted it :) shouldn't tweet before coffee
1	@PedroTGFerreira @cosmos4u great thanks! Such an interesting period and yet unclear the exact way it unfollowed. I'll have to get your book!
1	@cosmos4u hi @PedroTGFerreira just read your recent interview and curious how Einstein unveiled his theory? Was it a lecture series in Nov?
1	@cosmos4u interesting follow up is https://t.co/6lQ9x6Rnfz where Dr Pedro Ferreira discusses these lectures (in his book The Perfect Theory)
1	@mjrowland68 @BreakfastNews still gold
-1	@mazlangford @BreakfastNews I wrote my application in crayon. Seemed appropriate given my skill level in design :S
1	@cosmos4u the earlier papers I wasn’t certain of so that’s good to know!
1	@cosmos4u interesting  all the discussions I’ve been able to read distinctly phrase this as a presentation and not submitting the paper.
-1	@AunatEridu that's why I can spring out of bed at 5.30am for TV so easily :S
1	@cosmos4u he presented the Field Equations of Gravity to the Prussian Academy of Science on Wednesday 25th 1915
1	@mjrowland68 @BreakfastNews @Mad_Morris wow. I'm still speechless
1	Big thanks to @BreakfastNews top experimental physicists  @mjrowland68 @Mad_Morris for helping with my experiment
1	Fun chat w @mjrowland68 @Mad_Morris on @BreakfastNews about the "loneliest galaxy" https://t.co/KuQJQEnROq https://t.co/wJCrD1HZVA
1	@tassiedevil @BreakfastNews that's brilliant!
1	@upulie @realscientists congrats!!
1	@_Ali_Gray thanks!!
1	So exciting that @Swinburne sent #SDF students to @CERN to work on social/personal innovation #SDFGALA2015 https://t.co/XaHFVQ3WGX
1	@astronomyblog @jen_gupta excellent point  my suspicions are that that might be the safest way
1	@sandygrains well done for getting on board then!!
1	@sandygrains of course! I can quote most of the entire series :D
-1	@mca178 @Swinburne @usceduau gasp! We need this so badly!!
1	@JoshFrydenberg well spoken  considered words to @BreakfastNews in an emotive time. Nice interview @mjrowland68
1	@sarahkendrew @sarahcruddas @Izuvthesqrll I reckon Sahara might need to be included as well as sandstone formation depth issue
1	@AusAndgie7 fantastic!! Let's catch up before nearby??
1	@Izuvthesqrll @sarahkendrew @sarahcruddas eventually yes it's a massive upper limit but a few km seems reasonable  what do you think?
1	@Izuvthesqrll @sarahkendrew @sarahcruddas sure. I'm guessing most is in Sahara but it's a starting guess
1	@Helen_E_MC @upulie @AndyRickie thanks for that!! Can't believe I missed it  definitely gonna be fun :)
1	@upulie @Helen_E_MC eh?! Was I??
1	@sarahkendrew @sarahcruddas assume most sand in ocean floor  so 2/3 of earth's area x (absolute max) 5km depth / few microns^3
1	@sarahcruddas @sarahkendrew I've looked at this before  fine sand grinds down to a few microns across giving a reasonable upper number limit
1	@sarahkendrew @drarnakarick @AstroKatie I hope that coffee break lived up to the super high expectations! Safe travels Sarah!!
1	@AstroKatie @sarahkendrew @drarnakarick where you gang at now?
-1	@GruntledChalkie terribly drafty
1	Rob Knight reclaims 'astronomical' numbers for biology from astronomy at @Swinburne lecture. https://t.co/1ZPpm5aisy
-1	@dark_cypher @abcnews @BreakfastNews current loss rate means that any new atmosphere we create would last for millions of years
1	@dark_cypher @abcnews @BreakfastNews absolutely  although terraforming a planet is currently beyond us now it's even harder
1	I told @abcnews @BreakfastNews of how Mars lost its atmosphere  how centre of MilkyWay formed &amp; private space race https://t.co/LUS0NmSWua
1	@Cosmic_Horizons @BreakfastNews planet wide aurora like Mars!
1	@Cosmic_Horizons @BreakfastNews yep they'll get even closer (and possibly break into multiple poles!) as the field reversal/flip occurs
-1	@callumdav @mjrowland68 @LaTrioli @BreakfastNews it's honestly a privilege getting to chat space to them (and I was a far worse student!!)
1	@mazlangford @BreakfastNews if it helps that's when I got up too although you're a hero for having to deal with a baby that early!
1	Finally got to tell @BreakfastNews that $30m @glxp space race for private teams to reach moon is ON w @TeamSpaceIL https://t.co/TtNv02tRIe
1	Went on archaeological dig with @nasa on @BreakfastNews to the oldest neighbourhood of Milky Way the stellar bulge https://t.co/vyyxlr2uO1
-1	After Martian magnetic field failed ~4bn years ago it's air began to be blasted into space by Sun's @BreakfastNews https://t.co/ijXbjpBDHy

1	@kenny_ang @BreakfastNews not this time unless I can create the vacuum of space in the @abcnews studio  and you know how OH&amp;S is these days
1	Looking forward to ranting about #space to @abcnews @BreakfastNews 7.45am Monday. Can you guess the stories? https://t.co/ia1D2bBkB4
1	@Mighty_Ginge @NASA @Swinburne undergrad physics
1	@Mighty_Ginge @NASA its high on my priority list. I'll hopefully be offering it as a research project next year in @Swinburne
1	Mars had oceans 3.5bn yes ago  today is a freezing desert. How? @MAVEN2Mars found Sun's wind blasted atmosphere away https://t.co/FmJ3lK8KpI
1	@AAOastro I had no idea!! Congrats @astropixie
1	@cosmos4u no idea  I was impressed by the figures and societal impact metrics that did get squeezed into a single tweet though.
1	@AusAndgie7 @Cosmic_Horizons @AstroKatie @ABCNews24 thanks Andgie those are my favourite facts of the day :)
1	@PeterDEdmonds we're versatile
1	@astroswanny @lowflyingrocks @AmyMainzer @DSLauretta @OSIRISREx look at that go..! Just 10s exposures??
1	@Rebeccamay89 no problem! It's good to check
1	@Rebeccamay89 zero chance it will hit  definitely don't worry :)
1	@jegpeek @BenneHolwerda that's my Power Rangers version
1	@jegpeek dude I'm nearly back from UMelb..!

1	@Tim_O_Brien and excellent eyesight Tim..!
1	@Tim_O_Brien it sure is! :) a going away present when I left jodrell..!
1	@_BowlofCherries @BreakfastNews fantastic :) a future astrophysicist/astronaut perhaps??
1	Don't have to be a scientist to support your child's interest  just support their curiosity w museums &amp; science shows @BreakfastNews
1	@GruntledChalkie nice!
1	@AusSMC @Swinburne great catching you! Looking forward to the next breakthrough discovery :)
1	@kenny_ang @BreakfastNews my inlaws loaned it FOR SCIENCE
1	@AstroHyde definitely! I'm just waiting for some decent memes to come out :)

1	@chris_tibbs :)
1	@chris_tibbs yep. Southern Hemisphere World Cup now
1	.@sandygrains more likely than aliens :) the paper ruled out dust cloud from colliding planets  stellar pulsation/variation  telescope fault
1	@danversj @NASA_Hubble @Swinburne great idea… I’ll do that today and get some popcorn handy :)
1	@CosmicRami @MJIBrown @KetanJ0 @AstroKatie certainly more likely than using them for tidal power ;)
1	@JazzTwemlow @MJIBrown @KetanJ0 @AstroKatie global warming is actually something we'd want on Mars to terraform it..!
1	@MJIBrown @KetanJ0 @AstroKatie not sure about that  my gut feeling is solar more regular BUT both are better than hydro on Mars :)
1	@upulie fun :) a good taste of what we'll have to do onstage!!
1	@noitall762 @BreakfastNews @kavita_jade that it's got a blue sky? Nope this is what @NASANewHorizons saw
1	I told @abcnews @BreakfastNews about Pluto's Blue Skies  1000s of Apollo images online and this month's night sky https://t.co/A5ZRiikf11

1	@bencubby @MJIBrown @Cosmic_Horizons only because my mascara is running
1	@bencubby @MJIBrown @Cosmic_Horizons ouch! Never mind Mars  there’s salt water flows down my cheek right now after that
-1	@MJIBrown @bencubby @Cosmic_Horizons still reckon you should have led with my pun "soaking gun of water on Mars"
1	@sandygrains http://t.co/KWKjrbAOMX
-1	@sandygrains no :(
-1	@kemal_atlay @bencubby 1.30am sadly.
1	@bencubby yup. Wouldn’t miss it :) the only issue is then sleeping after hearing it!
1	@bencubby you staying up for the announcement too then?
1	For those like me in Oz that will miss the #LunarEclipse watch live on http://t.co/il6L9ilWww turning 'blood' red at noon EDT @BreakfastNews

1	Fun time wildly speculating to @BreakfastNews about @NASA  #Mars mystery. Spoiler: it's flowing water (dark streaks) http://t.co/rtF5mJYLdT
1	@RyanSheales @BreakfastNews I'll buy your gig tshirt with that on it
1	.@__ErinMarie yes I'll be on @BreakfastNews at 7.35 tomorrow morning ranting about space :)
-1	@Taraustralis I'm a fan first  scientist second so I'm gonna say @HawthornFC is odds on ;(
1	@kevinschawinski boom boom
1	@Hammeroids various levels of detail but geological features can tell of climate thousands-millions years previous. @MJIBrown is an expert
1	@CosmicRami @drspacejunk @upulie @AstroKatie no idea what stage its at  might physically exist but patent doesn't require it I think
1	@CosmicRami @drspacejunk @upulie @AstroKatie @anchor I'll certainly be keeping an eye out for this but is it only just an idea right now?
1	Wahoo! International Astronomical Union just approved my membership http://t.co/HgMSzRgXwC I feel internationally vouched for! Thx @IAU_org
-1	.@MJIBrown Alice Gorman &amp; I study Hancock's claim of Atlantis-destroying comet returning to end the world http://t.co/A6c2b96ARE spoiler: No

-1	I've reached peak career being grilled by @LaTrioli on alien abductions and probes for @BreakfastNews  https://t.co/M7a3IIYkV0
1	Just a tiny red dot but that we see it at all is amazing  early universe should have been filled by a 'fog' of cold gas @BreakfastNews
1	Light from the most distant galaxy we've confirmed travelled 13.2 billion years before reaching us  @BreakfastNews http://t.co/ZPH4El5ED4
-1	This 'tornado' is filled with iron heated to 3million degrees and over 5 Earths across. Nasty weather. @BreakfastNews
1	I reported (space) weather on @BreakfastNews w tornado on the Sun http://t.co/QRZFsWzuRe @VanessaOHanlon makes weather-reporting look easy
1	@AusAndgie7 @ausphysics @MCEC that's a fantastic initiative!

1	@FireballsSky @ClearSkiesTV @NASA_Lunar @JontiHorner I'm going with meteor 10cm - 1m across
1	.@sandysmw @FireballsSky when it reaches the denser lower atmosphere it slows rapidly heating up and glowing bright
1	@upulie @LaTrioli completely agree with that.
1	Hey @upulie do you know? https://t.co/xnuexR96CT
1	@e_astronomer @jgeach @JossBlandHawtho and this is why we cite... :)
1	@MooneyBen @Swinburne @UniofOxford @RogerLDavies its been excellent
1	Lots of mysteries still to solve about blackholes says @RogerLDavies &amp; @Swinburne has a team researching exactly that http://t.co/9WYH4QQnSp
1	Galaxy cluster in sim w/wo blackholes  they give lots of extra heat-&gt; stops galaxies growing @RogerLDavies @Swinburne http://t.co/gJRvTLzQkr
1	What happens when two spiral galaxies (like us and andromeda) collide? A mess! @RogerLDavies @Swinburne http://t.co/3wcV8abc8j
1	Blackhole grows from same infalling material that forms stars but energy from blackhole can stop this limiting both @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
1	@embilbie @EvilAngelPixie @RogerLDavies @Swinburne 100 billion billion billion billion lightbulbs :)
1	Is blackhole's huge gravity pulling in material to form stars? No! Only affects billionth of galaxy volume @Swinburne http://t.co/r5ZFs2YyAH
1	A clue is that both quasar numbers &amp; star formation in the universe peaked 5-8bn years ago @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
1	Curiously mass of supermassive blackholes are always ~0.2% of mass of the Galaxy. How does this connection form? @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
1	Most energetic 'active galaxies' are quasars- with 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000W of power @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
1	Supermassive blackholes can be highly active  blasting material &amp; radiation out into space @RogerLDavies @Swinburne http://t.co/Mt2iNrss3R
1	Using motion of these stars we can weigh our blackhole- 4000000x mass of our sun  that fits within Jupiter's orbit @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
1	Bigger blackholes can exist at centre of galaxies- we watch stars orbit around the supermassive black hole in MW @RogerLDavies @Swinburne
-1	Blackholes can steal material from companion stars which heats up as it spirals glowing X-ray hot which we see @RogerLDavies in @Swinburne
1	Unlike galaxies  blackholes are not vast. Relative to galactic scales they're tiny - @RogerLDavies at @Swinburne
1	Full house (&gt;450!) at @Swinburne to see @UniofOxford's @RogerLDavies chat #Galaxies and #BlackHoles http://t.co/x6LYd0wflp

1	@RichardFPenn @Swinburne which bit is the stretch? I can ask the doctoral candidate to send me a link to their research...
-1	@RichardFPenn @Swinburne not my research but it's accepted CJD (form of dementia similar to Alzheimer's) is caused by "mad cow disease"

1	@kimberlykowal I’ve been there one or twice I think but only for a day or two at a time.
1	@kimberlykowal What Joe said made me want to go visit!
1	@kimberlykowal is that guy based at the observatory full time?
1	@kimberlykowal I know right? He was telling me about someone there who knows so much about the technology from way back when.
1	@kimberlykowal I just ran into Joe Patterson in the elevator and he said you guys met yesterday!
1	@PlanetDr @elakdawalla is there a newer/more recent version of a water comparison like this? Also not just for ocea… https://t.co/LSSlUeLIzG

1	@stoutde I just wanted to point that out because it’s important to realize
1	@stoutde for future reference even joking about mansplaining as a man is not appreciated. you're privilege lets you joke. I cannot.
1	@DattaguruP and implied that you think they don’t know this already.
-1	@DattaguruP yes because explaining  anything related to why the patriarchy is even a thing is patronizing to someone oppressed by it.
1	@DattaguruP I’m not sure why you think you need to explain the size of the patriarchy to me.
1	@shannonmstirone IT MATTERS TO MEEEEE!
1	@kcenicola @JetBlue not for this flight.
1	@DownHereOnEarth @MashableScience @mirikramer she's on her honeymoon!!

1	@DrMRFrancis SAME
1	@WMMANews here's what I found: https://t.co/qUBWgzdkPj. Is that what you are asking about?
1	@WMMANews Saturn's rings rotate in the same direction as the planet  but there is an exoplanet around another star that seems to be the opp.
1	New launch schedule for @OrbitalATK Antares is tomorrow 10/17 ~7:40pm ET.  https://t.co/ydZcyu4T0V #spaceistheplace
-1	I confess I'm happy that the @OrbitalATK launch slipped till tomorrow because I was going to be on a plane today and would have missed it!

-1	#WCW @sondy for sharing her story via #astroSH and always be there for me on my #fuckPTSD days. Don’t let the bastards grind you down! 👊
1	#WCW @hubbahubble for being smart  strong  inspiring in astronomy  fashion  &amp; life. And speaking out re #astroSH https://t.co/Kk8U7lhFTK
1	@hubbahubble @NASAKepler https://t.co/1F8DQ1QRE3

1	@hubbahubble yikes that hemline is a little short for me… ;)
1	@hubbahubble @LOrealUSA LOVE. WANT.
1	@DrMRFrancis GOD MATTHEW
1	@13adh13 like so? https://t.co/PvvkW7WvCw
1	@vafarmboy yeah but the speed indicator didn’t show any of that happening...
1	@PlanetDr you did it right
1	@themadstone pretty much  yep ;)
1	@lorengrush yessssss
1	@nhuntwalker I’ll actually be in Seattle this weekend  we could work it out together!
1	@nhuntwalker @stoutde I am too! But too much on my plate this morning.
1	@nhuntwalker @stoutde #maththat
1	@nhuntwalker @stoutde haha  are you including math with that?
1	@nhuntwalker @stoutde I leave that to you  I need more coffee. ;)
1	@nhuntwalker @stoutde @mcnees both in our orbit and in the sun’s orbit.
1	@nhuntwalker @stoutde @mcnees I gave a talk this summer on the Sun which included how far we moved during the talk ~15min. ;)
1	@stoutde @nhuntwalker I got that too… 2.787782 light-sec/hr
1	@mcnees @nhuntwalker https://t.co/gK2oUDw1vN
-1	@nhuntwalker through our orbit around the sun  it’s roughly 0.365818 light-seconds/hr
1	@nhuntwalker I can actually tell you that…please hold...
1	@sharkespearean —&gt; @turnbullet666 was just telling me about it.
1	@PaulDesman thanks for all your kind words!
-1	@celinecelines did you have to cancel your full trip?
1	@jaimealyse I feel like you need to be my cruise director but for theater.
1	@celinecelines same. But it's probably safe to say I've had a better day than you. Hope you are healing and not in too much pain. 😘
1	@celinecelines how are you feeling? 💞💞💞
1	@PaulDesman I can't argue with that. 😊
1	@PaulDesman it got better later in the show as I recall no? But yeah  I agree.
1	@PaulDesman but @hardwick and I had a nice long chat about it on the @nerdist!
1	@PaulDesman thanks!! The convo was actually longer than what was edited into the show  but yeah not the greatest it comes off like that.
1	@RachelFeltman related: why is it so much fun to watch pretty people do nothing?!
-1	@RachelFeltman this is your fault. https://t.co/fG1RjJLpVz
1	@RachelFeltman great now you’re going to send me down a rabbit hole of Lauren Conrad gifs
1	@nhuntwalker I will likely go kiss the washer he touched in my laundromat later this week.
1	@nhuntwalker did you see my tweets about part of #LukeCage being filmed ON MY STREET?!?
1	@GoAstroMo @imaginescience haha  YESSSSSSS. https://t.co/FLXxYYpPGm
1	@GoAstroMo Hey I just say what you’ll be doing the @imaginescience film contest! YAY!
-1	@Alex_Parker I don’t know what FLIR one is but @astronomeara started a JWST selfie craze last year at AAS w/ the model. ;)
1	@DrMRFrancis same and same
1	@RachelFeltman welcome to the “IT’S IN THE SYLLABUS” club! https://t.co/rAUBLWUybW

1	@jegpeek I fly to Seattle on Thurs...
-1	@jaimealyse also being tall sucks for taking baths is a nyc apt. :-/
1	@jaimealyse related: I have a drafted startorialist post you are going to love. ;)
1	@hubbahubble I'm putting this on my list of things to look into "in all my spare time"
1	@hubbahubble haha. Sometimes google is your friend  sometimes it's not.
1	@shannonmstirone 😊
1	@hubbahubble yes would be interesting to see if anyone has looked at correlations btwn various pseudoscience areas that are common.
1	@iamstarnord @janagrc @hubbahubble it’s more believing that their motions have a direct impact on your day to day life.
1	@iamstarnord @janagrc @hubbahubble that’s actually a very popular outreach activity! Constellations  signs  myths aren’t the issue for me -&gt;
1	@hubbahubble either way tho my reaction is not to point and laugh.
1	@hubbahubble or conversely  by engaging to talk about real celestial science can be a gateway out of pseudoscience.
-1	@hubbahubble I will definitely reflect on that. My initial objection to astrology is I feel it’s a gateway to more serious pseudoscience.
1	@jaimealyse truth https://t.co/vN2UBA1HSJ
-1	@mirikramer I WILL MISS YOU https://t.co/MTvgku872V
1	@nhuntwalker @BrokenFiction for me  coffee as defined by Rosario. ;)
1	@celinecelines oh my gosh Celine  I hope you’ll be okay. Sending all my love. xox
-1	@shaka_lulu Yeah I know it looks pathetic  @AliShaheed Muhammad got me doing calisthenics.
1	@PlanetDr if I did it any other way my family would disown me.
1	@shannonmstirone @nybooks @Millicentsomer it’s the nyt version of doxing.
1	@FlyingTrilobite @mcnees @AstroKatie I like it! Thanks! I feel like astro photography is often uncredited here but should be like any other
1	@13adh13 that was thanks to @jegpeek. It took us forever to come up with a name until the time it just came out of his mouth in the office
1	@13adh13 also for future pi fashion  you might like these: https://t.co/Hg2dvOibHQ
1	@13adh13 well that clearly needs to happen.
1	@13adh13 I feel like you would appreciate this shirt. ;)  https://t.co/pyFEyWvXn2

1	@LaMinda I’ve seen it!!
1	@LaMinda awesome  thanks!!
1	@LaMinda Yes  I saw! Just wonder if you had any favs given you’ve raised a cool kid. ;)
1	@shannonmstirone @SciencEric same
1	@shannonmstirone @SciencEric HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED!
-1	@shannonmstirone @SciencEric I’m old enough to remember calling relatives on Sundays bc that’s when long distance was cheapest. ;)
1	@mcnees I love the title to that last one. ;)
1	@LaMinda Do you have any children’s books about space that you recommend?
1	@mcnees hey does cheeks have any favorite space/astro books?
1	@nhuntwalker at least we have twitter. ;) https://t.co/yPItVRLFAZ
1	@DrMRFrancis NOTHING thanks to netflix…. https://t.co/RzmDFtcaNd
1	@13adh13 I can’t wait to dive in! But I might need a time turner so I can read it all day today AND also binge on Luke Cage…

1	@DrMRFrancis same…but also Stanford football. ;)
1	@DrMRFrancis well done
1	@JackLScanlan @mirikramer @AhistoricalPics MY FRIDAY NIGHT BRAIN KNOWS NO SUCH THING 😂
1	@mcnees I was feeling good so I came back to see what heart stuff you tweeted - SO COOL!
1	@DrMRFrancis @20tauri awesome!!
1	@DrMRFrancis did @20tauri make that?!
1	@PlanetDr @AstroKatie https://t.co/A7eoLyr26b
1	@nhuntwalker In that case I think you mean @AliShaheed *IS* the magic.
1	@nhuntwalker omg @AliShaheed did the score?!?
1	@PeterDEdmonds @TrueSciPhi haha the @nerdist bump. ;)
1	@DrRubidium I don’t think it goes that far  but I will if it comes to that!
1	@DrRubidium @DrMRFrancis I was just asking for the NASA contact providing my materials  they have to do full accounting/reporting on use.
-1	@DrRubidium @DrMRFrancis what’s the expected audience size for DIYScience Zone (roughly)?
1	@nhuntwalker After I general some income by writing. ;)
1	@nhuntwalker I’m am trying to stay strong all day to get work done before I DO THE BINGE.
1	@DrMRFrancis @elakdawalla @KarenLMasters @AstroKatie https://t.co/Cv3tQkhvuS
1	@celinecelines could I write up a brief thing on Rosetta for your blog today?
1	@DrMRFrancis https://t.co/S595Slebof
1	@physicsmatt @AstroKatie I started the book over as soon as I finished it. It starts slow but builds so beautifully!
1	@physicsmatt @AstroKatie I binged the hell out of that when I saw it got to Netflix! Might have to do it again I love it so much.
1	Picturing @ESA_Rosetta as The Little Prince is helping me see this as a story w/ a happy ending. 💫 by @slowfactory_ https://t.co/4GlciZTWYi
1	@DrMRFrancis WHEEEEE! https://t.co/xx4TF0T7ZM
1	@phil_torres @AstroOnTapNYC no worries! Hopefully you can make a future one - next is Oct.27th. ;)
1	@PlanetDr me trying to comfort you. https://t.co/Dp9Nin3utq
1	My @AstroOnTapNYC tonight was about lunar libration  but I accidentally said lunar libation at one point. LOL
1	@Pillownaut omg i love that picture so much!
1	@mcnees only always https://t.co/jxlIsqtDpQ
1	@PlanetDr glad to know I can still get at least some sleep before the grand finale...
-1	@PlanetDr I knew it was low but I had no idea it was THAT low. So crazy!
1	I think I can speak for @shaka_lulu and @PlanetDr when I say: COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET COMET
1	@hubbahubble omg that is excellent use of that emoji - why I have not noticed/seen that before?!
1	I just got home from three hours of lunar loving w/ @AstroOnTapNYC  Now there is another desolate rocky body to drool over. #CometLanding
1	@PlanetDr does that mean it will really take another 8 hours to defend 16km? (my understanding was 7:20am ET touchdown confirmation)
-1	@themadstone how did I miss it was that big?!?!? The plush toy version is quite deceiving... 😂
1	@mcnees awwwwww
1	@DrMRFrancis same  tho I like the fall weather! Tbh for all my coffee talk I can only have ~1 per day or my heart will KILL ME.

1	@upulie exactly!
-1	@upulie ugh  that can totally happen and its brutal!
1	@shannonmstirone I don't actually eat either but I saw them in the check out line!
1	@upulie at least I came home with ALL THE SNACKS
1	@afamiglietti nice. When I taught a summer Astro course for HS kids in England I bought them galaxy bars and Haribo star mix.

1	@mgraves one thing I can say briefly is that it’s best to listen to what the ppl affected have to say and not just the ppl on the sideline.
-1	@mgraves I can’t get into it at the moment  but you should read what others have to say in the RTs in my timeline. No shortage of coverage.
1	@shannonmstirone LOLOLOLOL
1	@shannonmstirone https://t.co/AyzAUx42yx
1	@shannonmstirone oh we can’t include One Tab if we do I win by a LANDSLIDE.
1	@shannonmstirone haha  26 is actually pretty low for me.
1	@shannonmstirone I did write him…we’ll see. It was such a good convo though!
1	@shannonmstirone I got 26. ;)
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy yep :-/
1	@DrMRFrancis yep https://t.co/zlQFBxcVKV
-1	@DrMRFrancis the piece is an interview  all quotes. dead.
1	@mcnees I wrote about that for my Week in Geek last week! https://t.co/fAqhVjCF8q

1	@VanguardSTEM @13adh13 okay that’s awesome https://t.co/urjsJidUFw
1	@mcnees thanks for the heads up! 👊
1	@mcnees water is my therapy. 😍
1	@mcnees gah I want to go to there
1	@bug_gwen @GeekGirlCon @DrRubidium AMAZING 👏👏👏
1	@sharkespearean @LizNeeley i approve
1	@LizNeeley @sharkespearean I would walk 500 miles just to have b’fast w/ you two at 7:30am.
1	@MissAerospace *that* I can totally agree with. https://t.co/jBIO6z1jy1
1	@Paladin1969 I highly recommend it sometimes. 👍
1	@MissAerospace I really do appreciate this discussion even if my tweets might not sound like it!
-1	@MissAerospace I will def discuss what is/isn't appropriate behavior overall  I'm just reacting to tweets of disgust towards her. :-/
1	@MissAerospace if it was I would have talked to them in private  not shame them on the Internet. (Not implying that's what *you^ did) 2/2
1	@MissAerospace yes but I attended IAC while at @ISUnet and that could have easily been one of my int'l classmates. 1/2
-1	@MissAerospace just not rushing to be mad at someone whose situation in  I don’t know.
-1	@MissAerospace again I don’t disagree about #womeninSTEM  but the fight in the western world is far ahead of the fight elsewhere.
1	@callacofield @astrolisa this is that venue  if you’re at a major conference with a diverse audience and live-streaming it to the world.
1	@callacofield @astrolisa but also students from all over the world. If you want good Q  have them submitted in advance.
1	@rboyle31 fair enough  then the event should have been press only.
1	@MissAerospace I’m not arguing again the who comment + question thing  but the int’l nature of this conference reqs less judging (to me)
1	@PlanetDr ALL THE TELECONS?
1	@shannonmstirone yeah I’m looking into it now. found this to start: https://t.co/iFDrCDjNpq
1	@adrianprw @AllPlanets @elonmusk @SpaceX this doesn’t sound great. https://t.co/iFDrCDjNpq
-1	@shannonmstirone except for being homogenous. :-/
1	@adrianprw @AllPlanets @elonmusk @SpaceX I would assume so  but I don’t know numbers.
1	@mirikramer that’s where all the Russian behavioral studies come into play. ;)
-1	@ageekmom I have no idea how I missed this!
1	I worked on the X-34 at @OrbitalATK before switching to astrophysics.  https://t.co/yLPAizTJqO https://t.co/6AnqP79wyq
1	@mirikramer reasons https://t.co/ZVSazZsoF0

1	@arielwaldman that makes SO MUCH sense
1	@GeoSciTweeps @elonmusk oooh I like!

-1	@RobertGaristo The low correlation indicates that a number of the structures in the BICEP map are not from dust--leaving gravity waves.
-1	@RobertGaristo Eventually  when Planck analyzes with BICEP  they are going to have to cope with the low correlation between the two maps.
1	@RobertGaristo Planck paper is interesting for what it didn't do: they didn't publish their own map of BICEP region &amp; no correlation study.
1	@RobertGaristo Our results on that map for the ratio of the E and B modes was the same as what they got  to w/in one sigma.
1	@RobertGaristo One of the five mapping methods we used (giving r = .099) was quite similar to the one Planck adopted in their latest paper.

1	@RobertGaristo As the blue-shifted photons become infinitely shifted  they can cause a singularity that kills you.

-1	@brianwolven @AstroCook @AscendingNode @verbiscer Same arguments  through and through.
1	@brianwolven @AstroCook @AscendingNode @verbiscer JWST will be fine  but a waste of resources until we have an orbit for MK2.
1	@AstroCook @AscendingNode @brianwolven @verbiscer We considered all these options - practically infeasible.
1	@jtuttlekeane @AstroCook @brianwolven Not sensitive enough or capable of sufficient contrast  according to my reading of their papers.
1	@AstroCook @brianwolven Still a problem for reliable LGS/AO on a moving target; the TNO binary community has tried this with Gemini before.
-1	@AstroCook @brianwolven I thought about it. Still not clear that it would be sensitive enough  and the cadence issue is still a problem.
1	@AstroCook @brianwolven And Keck is not sensitive enough.
1	@AstroCook @brianwolven So  pretty much HST.
1	@AstroCook @brianwolven Need high-sensitivity  high-contrast  high-angular resolution imaging delivered regularly and reliably over a month.
1	@brianwolven Need multiple recoveries to know. Only facility that is capable on paper is HST.
1	@brianwolven We are likely within 10 years of the season  but we don't know how close beyond that. Could be ongoing as we speak.

1	@RocksInSpace @NASA_Dawn Great!
1	@RocksInSpace @NASA_Dawn Cool! Did that demo feature matching script help?
-1	@dwcssl @brianwolven @BadPhysics So you're saying any moon that gets a flotilla of new research probes should be deeply suspicious?

-1	@sondy @PlanetDr @_hroe Irregular with a very shallow SFD.
1	@BadPhysics Also  since "GIF" has been settled for good  perhaps I will leave pronunciation of QIL as the great controversy of our time.
1	@BadPhysics "Oh man  BadPhysics is absolutely QILing it on Twitter right now!"
1	@PlanetDr #squadgoals
1	@brianwolven Would have to see. Seems like the ability to arbitrarily structure the field would have some kind of benefit for application.
1	@brianwolven Compact ion optics?

1	@Summer_Ash @BadPhysics Sometimes referred to as the "Fourth Unforgivable Curse" in my Harry Potter headcanon.
1	@SarcasticRover @OtherOrbScience @PlanetDr ... those costs are justified. So like it or not  given your platform  we will call you on it.
-1	@SarcasticRover @OtherOrbScience @PlanetDr And space exploration IS expensive. And hard. And we work ourselves to exhaustion making sure...
-1	@SarcasticRover @OtherOrbScience @PlanetDr It is a hugely disingenuous representation of costs to an audience of people who payed for it.
1	@brianwolven @_hroe @elakdawalla Perhaps "Ssssssssss..." is meant to be followed by "...ea."
1	@brianwolven @sciencenotscary @bearmccreary I bet I could make a set of coils for my dulcimer.

-1	@astronomolly @PlanetDr ... to place the burden of proof on the proposal text itself ...
1	@astronomolly @PlanetDr ... presented by a (hopefully) clear and cogent plan of work and management. I am much more inclined...
1	@astronomolly @PlanetDr ... of someone's current ability to lead a team based on my past perceptions of them  particularly over evidence...
1	@astronomolly @PlanetDr As a reviewer I would never have the hubris to think that I could or should be the ultimate arbiter ...
1	@astronomolly @PlanetDr I agree that leadership matters. I just don't know if authorlist and name recognition are the way to demonstrate it.
1	@astronomolly @PlanetDr What information do reviewers have to judge leadership quality by other than bias-laden name recognition?
1	@wowinthedetails ... Pluto and its moons are all subjected to the same population of impactors. But  can't compare them to  say  our Moon!
1	@wowinthedetails Since most of the craters in the Pluto system are created by impactors coming in from the rest of the Kuiper Belt  ...
-1	@wowinthedetails ... about the relative amount of time that each surface has been exposed to those impactors.
-1	@wowinthedetails Given that the same population of impactors strike each surface  the number of craters per equal surface area tells you...

-1	@BadPhysics @AstroKatie @kennicosmith Unlikely; eccentricity of the orbit is zero to our ability to measure it. @AscendingNode knows more.
1	@AstroKatie @kennicosmith It shares the same pole as the rotation of Pluto.
1	@wowinthedetails They do! We use them as chronometers  where more craters in the same environment equate to an older surface.

1	.@pouet69 @PlanetDr @lukedones So to me  that bag sure looks like someone also took one for the team  so to speak.
-1	.@pouet69 @PlanetDr @lukedones ... only one of the crew would be hassled by hornets while the rest of us could eat in relative peace.
1	.@pouet69 @PlanetDr @lukedones ... which worked out nicely  because it more than any other food seemed to attract hornets. So each day...
1	.@pouet69 @PlanetDr @lukedones Back when I worked construction  inevitably one of the crew would bring fried chicken for lunch...

1	@DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @mike_malaska @caitvw more realistic than dreaming of a lifer position in academia  I think.
1	@DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @mike_malaska @caitvw I can train someone with eye on academic track or industry track or E/PO track...
1	@DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @mike_malaska @caitvw ... and then carry on as makes sense to their situation?
1	@DrFunkySpoon @erinleeryan @sondy @mike_malaska @caitvw How is that any different from denying someone whose dream it is to do a postdoc...

1	@DawnSunrise1 Certainly was! The light on the water was just magical. :)

1	@cosmos4u Nice! Had hoped to image this one with high-frame-rate CCD but just before disappearance laptop started installing updates! Grrr.
1	@DawnSunrise1 Nice one!
1	@cosmos4u Great video Daniel!
1	@GrahamBowes Exact timing depends on your location - it's in a few minutes from here in Somerset for example.

1	@AttreeJane Thanks! :-)
1	@mars_stu Cheers Stuart! :-)
1	@BeckePhysics Great image! I really like the subtle ejecta markings across Mare Imbrium around this phase  which you've caught very nicely.
1	@BeckePhysics Ha! Thanks - it's a bit hit and miss but you get a few frames with the station in them eventually. :-)
1	@unknownsymmetry Fantastic shot Charles! Nice one! :-)
1	@blobrana Thanks! :-)
1	This @BBCStargazing episode is fab. Great insight into the hairy Soyuz docking from @Cmdr_Hadfield who interpreted display panel 'live'.
-1	@mars_stu 'fraid so! I reckon we've got about a week before it becomes a real problem though.
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! I was certainly lucky - whole sky cloudy save for a small patch close to the western horizon where the Moon was.

1	@larlar1971 Thanks Sarah! Have a great weekend! :-)
1	September's a great time to observe Cygnus. In the new @SkyatNightMag I explore the science behind the constellation. http://t.co/RUidLWMcvq
-1	@DawnSunrise1 Oh yes! :-) Though the northern horizon does suffer from light pollution from South Wales.
1	@suthers @ESA_Rosetta Yep  that animation of the rotating nucleus is incredible! *Bounces up &amp; down waiting for imminent ESA release* :-)
1	I’ll be popping on to @SkyNews in about 20 minutes to discuss last night’s Perseid meteor shower peak. Hope you all managed to spot a few!
1	@SHasani61 Thanks Susanne! :-)
1	@larlar1971 Thanks Sarah! :-)
1	@HyperbolicX @SkyandTelescope Thanks! Pending your acquisition of a rocket ship there's always NASA's SDO: http://t.co/QyrIwhOFLH :-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Fab shot! I love the colours!
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
1	@mggtTaylor That'd be great! We'd love to have you on again. Yeah  you too.
1	@mggtTaylor Thanks so much for coming on the show this morning Matt. Was great to chat with you. Good luck for the next few weeks! :-)
1	Plus we'll speak live to @ESA_Rosetta project scientist @mggtTaylor about what the mission has told us so far. http://t.co/pkgWYMhmhq (2/2)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
1	@FailedProtostar Cheers Andrew! :-)
1	@unknownsymmetry Oh yes! :-)
1	@unknownsymmetry Thanks Charles! I reached my viewing point on the top of the Quantocks at ~3:30BST then watched the show for about 30mins.
1	@cosmos4u Could be good. Good signals on (earlier) VHF radar too: https://t.co/Y3pOdn1xUd
1	@blobrana Thanks! :-)
1	@david_hurn Yeah  it's a cool effect isn't it. Same thing always amazes me during meteor showers.
1	Excited to be hosting @Slooh’s live @AsteroidDay show later. Our special guest will be astronaut Richard Garriott! http://t.co/QjYxBUx2Tk
1	@FailedProtostar Cheers Andrew! Hope you got some clear skies!
1	@AlfrescoDB I was using a DSLR attached to a small refractor - both mounted on an equatorial tracking mount.
1	Here's a brief NASA video about how and why @SOFIAtelescope will observe the Pluto occultation later today: https://t.co/euYiZgsdyD
1	.@SOFIAtelescope is in the air preparing to study today’s occultation by Pluto. Observing info here if you’re in NZ: http://t.co/ByquRWHRX3
1	@mars_stu Thanks Stuart! Great to see you today.
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
1	@bbcweather Thanks! Sure  I'd be delighted. Can you email me via the email address at http://t.co/j3gZDP0Vum to arrange a licence please.
1	@DavidBflower @blobrana Ha! :-)
1	@Miss_Space_Geek Thanks Jenny! :-)
1	@SungrazerComets Thanks Karl! Mostly luck  really  that I didn't pack my scope away from earlier in the day! :-)
1	@mars_stu Isn't it just! I just finished imaging the flare &amp; then got the @aurorawatchuk red alert notification. Could be a long night! :-D
1	@DawnSunrise1 Great shot! I like your occulting disk! :-)
1	@jen_gupta Ha! :-)
1	@SkyandTelescope And many sketches by Parsons &amp; his colleagues are on show at Birr Castle. Well worth a visit! https://t.co/33zbdqRvct
1	@mikemenssen @SungrazerComets That's a comet day (for 67P that's 12.4 hours).
1	@DavidBflower Yeah  they're wonderful aren't they. Little windows onto the past.
1	@mars_stu Thanks Stuart. :-)
1	@nourtra00456201 Thanks! :-)
1	@mars_stu Yeah quite dark  though this was only a 6-second exposure. I took it last night in the Blackdown Hills here in Somerset.
1	I have a feature in June’s @SkyatNightMag looking at @NASA_Dawn’s arrival at Ceres &amp; what those white spots could be. http://t.co/AW7tUvAEbc
1	And here’s @DrStuClark writing about the enduring scientific appeal of noctilucent clouds: http://t.co/V3XtPpEZyC
1	To prepare us for noctilucent cloud season here are some beautiful words from @mars_stu on the thrill of the chase. https://t.co/mHXuQW8UV7
1	@unknownsymmetry Oooh  sounds good! Each channel was 2500 frames. Then used best ~200 in the stack.
-1	@unknownsymmetry Yeah  colour image (no luminance channel) made from RGB images captured through filters by a mono CCD.
1	@AstroExeter Yeah  eventually. It could do with some H-alpha data too I reckon.
1	@AstroExeter Cheers John. It was a mix of 15x 120 seconds (for the core)  15x 180 seconds &amp; 15x 240 seconds.
1	@DavidBflower @Slooh Cheers David! If you're out observing while we are on air let us know how you're getting on. Just use #SuperSaturn.
1	@DavidBflower @Slooh Good luck David! :-)
1	Those new @NASA_Dawn images also show those long features (cracks?) that we glimpsed in February much more clearly. http://t.co/8Zh2acROm5
1	Wow! Great new animation from @NASA_Dawn of those intriguing bright spots on Ceres. http://t.co/2zSoI9qffD http://t.co/3BU5Rc0OLk
1	I’ll be on @SkyNews shortly to talk about this new study looking at possible exo-asteroid debris on a white dwarf: http://t.co/TwjP1uZIII
1	@unknownsymmetry Excellent! :-)
1	@roger931 @mickhyde @skyatnightmag Thanks Roger! Really pleased to hear that. Am sure the mag would love to see any images you make! :-)
1	@david_hurn Yes it appears there's multicellular life on this planet! :-)
1	@m_vandenbrouck @marekkukula I hope so!
1	@m_vandenbrouck @marekkukula Looking forward to it! See you both very soon!
1	That article features @mars_stu  @elakdawalla  @mickhyde &amp; @tedstryk - all worth following for amazing pics &amp; more.
1	In the May issue of @SkyatNightMag I talk to the enthusiasts creating spectacular images from space mission data. http://t.co/PAPy1xbJur
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
1	@DavidBflower Yeah they look superb with a white-light solar filter don't they. Lots of interesting faculae &amp; features in the penumbrae.
1	@DawnSunrise1 Lovely shot Dawn! :-)
1	@unknownsymmetry Thanks Charles! :-)
-1	@cosmos4u Had a very blurry view of it yesterday as the Sun was setting. Will be interesting to see how it develops. http://t.co/KSQ7eXnPAE
1	@DawnSunrise1 Wonderful! Yes  you too Dawn! :-)
1	@FailedProtostar Thanks Andrew! :-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Lovely shot Dawn! There have been some spectacular cloud formations at sunset lately haven't there.
1	@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-)
1	@Astroguyz Thanks David! :-)
1	@larlar1971 Thanks Sarah! :-)
1	@DavidBflower I thought the same David! The group has grown noticeably in 24 hours  let's see if it has a sting in its tail! :-)
1	@KeithMansfield Hey Keith! I think there's only an Apple app at the moment. Android app coming soon apparently.
1	@DavidBflower Thanks David!
1	@unknownsymmetry Thanks Charles! Yes  I'm still using my PST and those images were taken with it.
1	@DawnSunrise1 Beautiful aren't they. They were certainly swaying in the breeze this afternoon! :-)
1	I’ll be speaking about exoplanets at @WellsMendipAstr’s @BBCStargazing event on Sat. Details @ http://t.co/FC0ni42pB9 http://t.co/gRN7e6C5qf
1	@DawnSunrise1 Sorry Dawn  I missed this earlier. Fab pics of the eclipse! I love the shot with the thin branches - wonderfully atmospheric!
1	@manic_dave @skyatnightmag Thanks Dave! :-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! Yes  very happy - just getting my energy back now from racing around. :-)
1	@DavidBflower Thanks! No  quite the opposite. We had a fair bit of rain &amp; lots of cloud. The gaps were in all the right places though! :-)
1	@_TheGeoff Brilliant! :-)
-1	Don't forget folks  the fifth series of @BBCStargazing kicks off tonight at 8pm on BBC Two. http://t.co/vK9yYbQj2A
1	@DavidBflower Cool. Looking forward to seeing your pics! :-)
1	@DavidBflower Afternoon! Sort of! :-) All the kit is tested  charged and ready. Now just waiting to see what the weather will do. You?
-1	Just sent the paperwork to the @metoffice to get the clouds switched off next Friday. To be honest  was surprised no one had done it yet!
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! And to you too! Don't think there's any 'official' # per se. Both seem quite popular. I only had room for one! :)
1	@DavidBflower No problem! :-)
1	Great views of the @NASA_SLS solid-rocket booster test just now on NASA TV: http://t.co/Ud8uNBDjLv
1	Folks  be sure to follow ace cameraman @mpg666. He'll be filming the eclipse on 20/3 for @BBCStargazing from a plane flying over the Faroes.
1	@DavidBflower Thanks David! That's very kind of you. :-)
1	Thanks to everyone who tuned in to our live show on @NASA_Dawn tonight. If you missed it you can catch it again here: http://t.co/QtsI7WFjWO
1	@I_C_Ceres @DawnSunrise1 Indeed you are! :-)
1	Great news that @NASA_Dawn is now orbiting Ceres. We'll speak live with some of the team on our @Slooh show @ 6pm UT. http://t.co/gwyVPaO0qx
1	Mark your diaries! We’ll have a live @Slooh show on Friday (18:00UT) to celebrate the arrival of @NASA_Dawn at Ceres: http://t.co/gwyVPaO0qx
-1	My piece in March’s @SkyatNightMag looks at @MESSENGER2011 &amp; the revolution in Mercury science that it’s instigated: http://t.co/K7KSnV756t
1	@Darnell Not yet. Bright patches/spots on planetary bodies are often related to ices of some kind. We'll find out soon as Dawn gets closer!
1	Brilliant! The @Planck/BICEP2 gravitational-waves-signal-in-the-CMB debate gets the @acapellascience treatment: http://t.co/5QzFFx5ZX2
1	@suthers @popastro @Dr_Lucie Fab video! Fingers crossed for clear skies! :-)
1	@Johnimus_Prime @BBCStargazing Thanks! Really kind of you to say! :-) Yeah  Skylon is something I'd love to write about in the future.
1	@DawnSunrise1 Cheers Dawn! :-)
1	@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-)
1	@unknownsymmetry Thanks Charles! :-)
1	@SungrazerComets Seems to be in ambient mode ATM  but you can see a (modelled) CME heading toward Lovejoy @ 02:08 in https://t.co/RNZnbYZqkH
1	@SungrazerComets Given Lovejoy’s position  I wonder if 9 Feb event (on Sun’s E limb https://t.co/MOQwCYMAnz) has something to do with it?
1	@DavidBflower Yep! :)
1	@fcain Also known as the ‘Nigel Tufnel question’. ;-D
1	Paul Eccleston from @RAL_Space_STFC says @twinkle_mission's scope will be modified version of RALCam-4 design with a 0.5m mirror. #TwinkleUK
1	@DawnSunrise1 Great! Do say hello! :-)
1	Off to #AstroFest later  but first to the @RoyalAstroSoc to hear about a new UK space mission that'll study the atmospheres of exoplanets.
1	@Adriansweather Thanks! :-)
1	@FailedProtostar Cheers Andrew! :-)
1	@ActiveAstro Great shot! :-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks! :-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 That's lovely Dawn! You've caught Copernicus' ray ejecta superbly &amp; the wrinkle ridges north of C.Herschel are showing up too.
1	@NaomiDubois @EpicCosmos Thanks! :-)
-1	@OldCrank That field of view is (very) roughly one degree on the long side.
1	@OldCrank Thanks! It shows the motion over a period of 23 minutes and 40 seconds.
1	@cain_rob @Astroguyz @VirtualAstro Thanks! :-)
1	@DavidBflower Good luck David! :-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 later from the UK with a small telescope and clear  dark skies.
1	@DawnSunrise1 Yes  our live coverage of the close approach has ended &amp; the asteroid is now speeding away from Earth. It should be visible...
1	I’ll be talking to Dermot Murnaghan on @SkyNews shortly about the fly-by of asteroid #2004BL86 and what we can learn from it.
1	@mortimerzilch Thanks. Yes  GRS didn't appear over the limb until about 7am by which time I'd gone indoors. :-) North is up in these pics.
1	@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-) This was with the CCD (with a 3x Barlow lens element fitted on its nosepiece) in the focuser of 8-inch SCT.
1	@FailedProtostar Thanks Andrew! Glad I could help out! :-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :)
1	@rjmlaird Thanks Ryan! :-)
1	@DavidBflower Cheers! Though can't claim any skill on my part  just pure luck! :-)
1	@metrolinaszabi Thanks! :-)
1	@FamilyoFlowers @PeoplesAstro @NorwichAS @VirtualAstro @shaunreylec Lovely shot! Nice one! :-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
1	Fab wide pics of Comet Lovejoy from @suthers https://t.co/yy7aPrsNrh  @hipydeus https://t.co/CbWKOU3aHQ &amp; @mars_stu https://t.co/BGokaWiLFq
1	@mars_stu No problem! Yeah  got to see it several times while the Moon was around but only glimpsed it last night due to rain &amp; clouds. You?
1	@mars_stu You can configure it to update every day if you like.
1	@mars_stu If you go into the configuration window in Stellarium there’s a plugin that can be switched on to highlight stars with exoplanets.
1	@DawnSunrise1 Great shot Dawn! You've captured the green colour of the coma very well. :-)
1	@GrahamBowes Excellent image Graham! The coma is showing up beautifully there.
1	@numerisphere Thanks Alex! :-)
1	@DavidBflower Thanks David! That's a section I'm hoping to add more to over the winter! :)
1	@DawnSunrise1 @angegarrod Ha!
1	@DavidBflower Great stuff! Don't forget to submit it to Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2015!
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! That's really kind of you to say. I was lucky to get a night of great seeing. A very happy new year to you too!
1	@FailedProtostar Thanks Andrew! :)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
1	@GrahamBowes Cheers Graham! :)
1	@DavidBflower Thanks David. :-)
1	@DavidBflower You too David! Hope 2015 brings you clear skies! :-)
1	@DavidBflower Cheers David! :-)
-1	The resurrected @NASAKepler spacecraft has discovered the first alien world of its K2 mission: http://t.co/1klo4LGh2d http://t.co/jKqENsWm6f
1	@DavidBflower @Slooh Absolutely! Just hoping the clear forecast we have here holds. Best of luck with the imaging! :-)
1	Look out for my feature in Dec’s @SkyatNightMag about the astronomers who are giving @NASAKepler a new lease of life: http://t.co/MBWgwdrZzB
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-)
1	@PenguinGalaxy IIRC I was talking about the formation of EGGs. Hester et al. from 1996 explains a possible process: http://t.co/3lLZd8tWqJ
1	@PenguinGalaxy Was that when I talked about M16's EGGs in my Hubble talk? Intro to this paper covers some theories: http://t.co/DllilRwsKV
1	@PenguinGalaxy It's well worth a visit Alice. Lots of other astronomy &amp; space stuff in the museum too.
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks! :-)
1	@david_hurn Thanks David. :)
1	@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-)
1	If you missed last night’s excellent @BBCStargazing #CometLanding special  here’s the iPlayer link. http://t.co/LAlCbpEeJS #TheSkyatNight
1	@astronomyblog @TM_Eubanks @LauraKeeney @KeithMansfield @b0yle Liking these suggestions folks! :-)
1	@DavidBflower Yep. ~2.5 hrs' work in total to calibrate &amp; then mosaic all the panes together in Photoshop Elements before adding colour etc.
1	@AstroExeter Thanks John. :-) It was an Imaging Source DMK 21AU618.AS.
1	@numerisphere Thanks Alex. :-)
1	@DavidBflower sometimes see tiny flashes of light - essentially 'end on' meteors.
1	@DavidBflower Of course! :-) During a particularly active shower if you point a pair of bins or rich field scope near the radiant you can...
1	@DavidBflower of weeks so you may see a few more modest fireballs then.
1	@DavidBflower They are really quite spectacular David. The one in that video was clearly very bright  but the Leonids peak in a couple...
1	@fedkukso Thanks! :)
1	@m_vandenbrouck Ha! At least it actually is a moose!
1	@DavidBflower Thanks David! :-)
1	@FitzsimmonsAlan Wait  I thought it was 'BBC Alan'?! :-)
1	@KeithMansfield Thanks Keith! Hope you are well. :-)
1	@ct_la Thanks! :-)
1	@b0yle Congratulations Alan!
1	@TarynKelly7 Thanks! Yes  I did. :-)
1	@ct_la @CampOther No stickers used here. All carved by hand with a craft scalpel  cocktail stick &amp; spoon. :-)
1	@DavidBflower I’d certainly love to go climbing there! :-)
1	@astronomyblog Awesome! Thanks Stuart. :-)
1	Great moment earlier today when @Philae2014 met the Philae obelisk with some of the @Philae_Ptolemy team. http://t.co/IHiueEEggM
1	Had great fun at @TheUniverseShow last night. Still time to catch the tour ft. @chrislintott  @PeoplesAstro &amp; others. http://t.co/VA3L0sQOTm
1	In August I visited @RAL_Space_STFC to see a laser that makes mini supernovae. Full story in Nov’s @SkyatNightMag. http://t.co/ZQIdnTrF66
1	@grb090423 Cheers! :-)
1	@astronomyblog Your GitHub rendering of 67P is coming in very handy for a little project I'm working on. Thanks! :) http://t.co/mRol7dzDhM
1	@mars_stu Was fab to finally meet you Stuart! :-)
1	MT @NASASunEarth A video of yesterday’s solar flare and a twisted eruption of plasma  as seen by #SDO: http://t.co/RlHi91TFUT
1	@mars_stu Yeah  it gives a flavour of that  but I should note that was not intention. I'm working on the accurate relative-scale version. :)
1	@_TheGeoff Ha! Wouldn't the surface have to be silvered too? Anyway  I'm not sure how I feel about making it shinier than it already is! :)
1	@tweetsoutloud Thanks Bobak! :-D
1	@GeertHub Thanks Geert! :)
1	@blobrana Thanks. :) Yeah  I'll probably wait until the January apparition.
1	@_TheGeoff Or maybe a *really* long selfie stick.
1	@eatswimbikerun @GrahamBowes Thanks! Yes! Sign me up for the next flight. :-)
1	@DavidBflower Great shot David! Moon was looking lovely this evening wasn’t it.
1	@DavidBflower Hi David. Sorry I missed your FF tweets. Thanks so much! :-)
1	@fcain Thanks Fraser! :-)
1	Look out for my feature in October's @SkyatNightMag about one of the most exciting @HubbleTelescope projects yet. http://t.co/RAvYv2riQ5
1	@mars_stu @skyatnightmag Thanks Stuart! That’s very kind of you to say. :-) Was a really interesting project to write about.
1	@drm317 @skyatnightmag Thanks Daniel! Really pleased you enjoyed it. :-)
1	@FreelancePhilos Thanks! :)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :)
1	@mars_stu Me too. Just been looking at some slides(!) I took on the day. :-)
1	@AstroEmz @sciencefocus Thanks! Glad you liked it. :-) @mggtTaylor was a great interviewee.
1	Should be on @SkyNews just after 4:15pm talking about @ESA_Rosetta. My office currently being turned into a studio. http://t.co/mxHYPB84cm
1	@Nancy_A Thanks Nancy! :-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! That’s lovely – great sense of depth with the clouds  ISS  stars and distant galaxy.
1	In Aug's @sciencefocus I look at how Rosetta survived turmoil to become one of the most exciting space missions ever. http://t.co/U3w3OSbcua
1	In August’s @SkyatNightMag (out Thursday) I explore the science of planetary nebulae  the night sky's glowing ghosts. http://t.co/lifFjuxHtv
1	@ettorins Thanks!
1	@gaokerena @cosmos4u This morning? In the northern sky? Quite possibly - there was a good display this morning.
1	@spaceindnews Thanks! :-)
1	@mars_stu Thanks. :) It's a single exposure of 1 minute @ ISO1600 (hence the noise)  18mm lens. Tracked by an HEQ5 Pro mount.
1	@erichand I've been speaking to some of the scientists here about that. Feeling seems to be that it's something to think about certainly.
1	@ettorins Thanks!
1	@manic_dave @skyatnightmag Thanks Dave  that's very kind of you. Crazy that it's been 20 yrs isn't it - when will the next one be I wonder!
1	In July’s @SkyatNightMag (out today) I speak to the astronomers who watched Shoemaker-Levy 9 hit Jupiter 20 yrs ago: http://t.co/NG6tIHFPKu
1	@_TheGeoff …optics are a bit outside my field though. Maybe one for Les Cowley at http://t.co/0iy8dxiiEw?
1	@_TheGeoff Strange! My guess is it was a lingering contrail drifting slowly south that appeared curved due to perspective. Atmospheric...
1	@_TheGeoff Also fogbows don't tend to be that large on the sky.
1	@_TheGeoff From your directions my initial thought was lunar fogbow (as Moon was in SE)  but diagonal feature in pics looks like contrail.
1	@_TheGeoff Hmm...what part of the sky was it in? How smooth an arc was it?
-1	@mars_stu We need those 5-day planetary waves to kick in. Had a hint of them here in Somerset about a week ago so...
1	@DavidBflower Thanks David! Yes  and lots going on in H-alpha too.
1	The latest projects to be awarded NIAC Program funds include a Titan submarine &amp; a comet ‘hitchhiker'. http://t.co/rPmii8pOpP @sciencefocus
1	Yep! Definitely visible in the Juliusruh view. MT @cosmos4u Are these #NLCs in the NE German live views at http://t.co/LpttUngkaZ …?
1	@DavidBflower Cheers David! :-)
1	@AstroExeter Looking forward to it John! Always enjoy visiting the NLO. :-)
1	@Dam1enW @DawnSunrise1 Great shot Damien!
1	@remybergsma Nice one Remy!
1	@DawnSunrise1 Now's the time to have a go! :-)
1	@PCDPhotography Thanks! :-)
1	@mars_stu Cool isn’t it. Love that I have a ‘sibling’ to point to now when I tell people that our Sun spent its infancy in a star cluster.
1	@_TheGeoff Ha! :D
1	@Tim_O_Brien Look on the bright side  if it is chilly at least your ice cream won’t melt! :-)
1	In May’s @SkyatNightMag (out tomorrow) I look at Saturn’s rings &amp; the exciting next phase of @CassiniSaturn’s mission http://t.co/BvFUWwgsqf
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn. That's a lovely image - very atmospheric. :-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Excellent! I’ll expect a full observing report! ;-)
1	@GMTelescope Thank you! :-)
1	Great to hear @OSIRISREx has got the go-ahead for construction. Very excited about this one. http://t.co/d1CAM22BHC http://t.co/PXkiOJNoj0
1	@david_hurn Thanks David. Hope you get some steadier skies soon.
1	@GrahamBowes That's a great shot Graham! I've gotta have a go at trying that! :-)
1	@DawnSunrise1 Thanks Dawn! :-) Great afocal shot - the dark surface regions stand out nicely and the colour balance is very nice.
1	@GrahamBowes Thanks. I was lucky to get a few moments of reasonable seeing conditions. Helps that I collimated the scope tonight too. :-)
1	My latest feature in @SkyatNightMag looks at the NIRSpec &amp; MIRI spectrographs that will fly on @NASAWebbTelescp: http://t.co/AfRu81ntyy

1	@david_hurn Thanks David. :-)
1	@cosmos4u Brilliant! Good luck tonight.
1	@einionyn Thanks Geraint. :-) IIRC I started shooting at ~21:47UT and all of those images were taken over the following ten minutes or so.
1	@KarenLMasters @dallascampbell @jodrellbank @Dr_Lucie Thanks Karen. :-) I've put up a gallery of them here: http://t.co/Ynky36n7nA
1	@cosmos4u Hi Daniel. Yeah  we arrived on station at 59.9°N  4.2°W and then our orbits slowly tracked north to the region of 61.1°N  3.0°W.
1	@astropixie @skyatnightmag Lovely isn’t it. All the work of the mag’s very talented art editor  Steve Marsh.

-1	@natecochrane @R_Chirgwin disks are mostly hydrogen &amp; helium - not great building materials!
-1	@natecochrane @R_Chirgwin i lean toward the warped protoplanetary disc of rubble idea myself.  can't wait until we can take images of these!
-1	@natecochrane @R_Chirgwin and it would be unstable during construction - very complicated process i would imagine!
1	@natecochrane @R_Chirgwin harnessing a star's energy: good idea. dyson sphere? unlikely. where would material come from to build it?
1	@natecochrane @R_Chirgwin you rang?
-1	@PlanetDr ugh  i know that feeling.  they know you're thinking about them.  💜

1	@jen_gupta great to meet you! (finally!)
1	@astronomyblog my face in the still photo - haha!  reminds me of ida's grimace a little.
1	@jen_gupta i tried once.  they mostly only laughed at things that werent meant as jokes.  planned jokes - mostly fell flat.  tough business!
1	@jen_gupta @raspberrysauce @adam_avison oh  i've never seen that one!
1	@PeterDEdmonds @jen_gupta similar - it's an ergobaby carrier!
1	@emilylurice @Summer_Ash @startorialist @eblur27 @IFTTT that must be what i'm thinking of...
1	@Summer_Ash @emilylurice @startorialist see DM
1	@Summer_Ash @emilylurice @startorialist ah ok.  was any of it accomplished as a hack?
-1	@emilylurice @Summer_Ash did you start @startorialist as a result of a AAS hack?
1	@DaveKary @claudiascosmos any suggestions?

1	@cwmagee i dont have to know an AU to use a parsec. was defined long before my time! once defined  its usable anywhere
1	@cwmagee use the average distance
1	@cwmagee my point still holds.
1	@cwmagee defined using tools of earth's revolution around sun  but then useful anywhere since it's just a distance.
1	@stuartgary good luck with whatever new adventures you find  stuart! we'll miss @ABCstarstuff!
1	@astronomyblog for me too!

-1	@InvaderXan @JontiHorner @BadAstronomer explains the lack of IR to boot!

1	@astronomyblog @chrisenorth is the book available yet?
1	@drspacejunk @LisaFogarty if only we could share smells online (i very rarely think that thought....)
-1	@drspacejunk @LisaFogarty the chemistry kinda scares me (if i'm honest) but i'm ready to give it a go!
1	.@astronomyblog @drspacejunk @AusAndgie7 yes  i'm often assumed to be male when i use Dr and no first name.  it's infuriating.
1	@alankerlin @AusAndgie7 YES! change will come from influential men stepping up to their leadership roles (@MatthewColless is good example)
-1	@alankerlin @AusAndgie7 @MatthewColless seniour academics need to pressure each other with higher expectations!

1	@FimusTauri @bbc5live @wendyzuk @rhod_sharp the light we see is before it falls across event horizon of BH - then information is lost.
1	@FimusTauri @bbc5live @wendyzuk @rhod_sharp restframe massless
1	@FimusTauri @bbc5live @wendyzuk @rhod_sharp ...we dont know if the radiation was from a star or which star  etc...
-1	@FimusTauri @bbc5live @wendyzuk @rhod_sharp information loss paradox is about entire object (star maybe) that falls in. if BH evaporates...
1	@FimusTauri @bbc5live @wendyzuk @rhod_sharp light particles (photons) are massless  so do not contribute to gravitational profile.

1	@astrofrog @jegpeek this has been my strategy for a while
1	@cwmagee @TerryEesti no  it's not normal practice.  that's why i was surprised enough to point it out.

1	@kevinschawinski @vrooje @chrislintott @astrokatie sure  but (i think) media here approached scientists about doing a short-term thing here
1	@chrislintott @kevinschawinski  @AstroKatie not sure about the history or how it got initiated.
1	@chrislintott @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse @AstroKatie by the time i found out about it  it was too far developed to change much.
1	@chrislintott @kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse GAMA http://t.co/fkWv3kvKGq
1	@kevinschawinski @the_zooniverse similar  yes  but ABC wanted to do its annual citizen science month project with an aus-based group.
1	@rewir8rh83 thanks for the feedback  jack!  will pass this along to @ABCscience.
1	#askAAO is on for the next hour.  follow @AAOastro and ask spacey questions for @kwkuehn!  https://t.co/jjMtu9VxGm

1	@jegpeek @astronomolly @shaka_lulu @sarahkendrew for a minute i thought #mockuni was the @SarcasticRover of extragalactic astronomy.
1	@Mozziebites @DrMaggieHardy @DrEmmaLJohnston @_PHAA_ @iamscicomm i take this with me to my 6-month reviews  and use it for time management
1	@Mozziebites @DrMaggieHardy @DrEmmaLJohnston @_PHAA_ @iamscicomm date/time  tv/radio program or event or school  topic  link if available
1	@kejames also  cant expect perfection immediately. we must praise progress or people wont feel encouraged to acknowledge steps taken.
-1	@DrMaggieHardy @DrEmmaLJohnston @Mozziebites @_PHAA_ @iamscicomm a friday arvo chore is to open my file and add week's outreach activities
1	@kejames @astrokiwi true  my wording could have been better at encompassing the total of what the panel was discussing.
-1	@kejames @astrokiwi they discussed best practices for many different topics: gender  diversity  mental health  harassment  bullying  etc.
1	@kejames @astrokiwi some panel members were representing orgs who received highest levels of our pleiades awards http://t.co/7HeXMuYoWv
1	@kejames @astrokiwi yes  karen  you made many quick assumptions and conclusions from very little info in a tweet.
1	@kejames seeing the community discuss the issue  even among a panel w/out POC  is a ++ thing. maybe organizers tried to diversify it? idk
1	@kejames i get that  &amp; agree. please understand how small the aus astro community is (500) &amp; how desperately it lacks diversity.
1	@kejames the panel was at our annual "Women in Astronomy" meeting talking institutional policy. discussion moved into diversity as well.
1	@kejames and can also say the next step in the process in australia is to improve number of POC  b/c #s so low! none in senior roles (2/2)
1	@kejames yes  it occurs to people. i did not select the panel  but i thought the discussion was good (1/2)
1	@kejames @cosmicpinot @Meg_Urry @evil_dr_hopkins @caastro_arc true statement. the discussion is happening: step 1.
1	.@JontiHorner yes  at the most basic level  language can impede or progress communication. it's hard to give up the comfort of jargon!
1	@CosmicRami @AstroKatie @astroduff @upulie @drspacejunk @CatherineQ that's awesome!
1	@sarahkendrew @chrislintott darrencroton oops  meant @PlanetDr in last tweet!

1	@GeertHub @cosmicpudding @j_t_allen BOOOOOO!!!!!!! 😕
1	@reneehlozek thanks for sharing your post on fb.  excellent read.  i needed the reminder to sit  stop  and take a deep breath.
1	@cwmagee @chrislintott @Biggreenbooks mostly good - mainly classics that i kept telling myself i would get around to reading.

1	@_sarahmartell_ @GorillaLibrn yes  but i havent seen any #dityspacenews that i would describe as "sexy"
1	@scottsmedley @AAOastro i like an "aperture of astronomers" but there is not an official word :)
1	@Blackprojects @El_Lobo_Rayado @LisaFogarty @SAMI_survey @AAOastro VERY big for this type of data!
1	@LarryWest42 @El_Lobo_Rayado yes  most likely.
1	and #MDGal15 is officially opened by @AAOastro director @wjcouch! http://t.co/tpdPpiIq76
-1	@drspacejunk i was shocked and intrigued to see that ad last month! didnt manage to try it though
1	@Blackprojects cool!  there are theories  but with no way to test.... we cannot verify or disprove!
1	@DoctorZen thanks!! :)
1	@pdunwin @elakdawalla @NASA_Dawn you read the article?

1	@Blackprojects of course it got a gravity boost from jups! if you look at the trajectory  still pretty direct  no major kink to grab a boost
1	@AstroHyde YES!   you understand.....
1	@AAOastro @astromatto i would have tagged you  matto  but i couldnt seem to remember your twitter handle!  oops.

1	@merrdiff @jradavenport @dalcantonJD Let me/us know if you need any.. gentle correction assistance  Jim :D
1	@merrdiff ...do emails need to be sent?
1	@merrdiff Excuse me what now?
1	@BenneHolwerda Or conferences that say "YOU MUST ATTEND ALL THREE DAYS" or whatever.
1	@NGC3314 @SARA_Obs It looks like a fortune cookie!
-1	@IBJIYONGI @PlanetDr I mean  I'll take one day of not being the special disaster  don't get me wrong ;)
1	@PlanetDr @spacejammie things that ought to help somehow do not.
1	@Mad_Science_Guy I don't know why  but this really reminds me of @TheBloggess
1	@GattaKat @hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI Yup! @Erikaham won one! I'm too old now :D
1	@jr_pritchard Always here for Bose Einstein Condensates.
1	.@DrMRFrancis Context : Overrated.
1	@PlanetDr hahahhahhaha. I gotta get me in on some of that action.
1	@PlanetDr @astroprofhoff Not yet. I like to leave things to look forward to.
1	@merrdiff @johannateske @chgreer I feel like maybe @jegpeek was involved with that? But I think a few summarized would be cool.
1	@johannateske @chgreer @merrdiff Like  imagine how helpful it would be? We also really should be doing audio versions of the CSWA blog.
1	@chgreer @johannateske @merrdiff I've also been thinking about how to add mp3's of the abstracts.
1	@chgreer @johannateske @merrdiff OOOH. I've thought about this too. Let me know if you need help.
1	@jegpeek pictures? What approach did you go with?
1	@astronomeara I think it is the only sensible path  honestly.
1	@vrooje @jegpeek @sarahkendrew WE COULD SCHEME
1	I really want to go to @jegpeek &amp; @sarahkendrew's super cool sound conference  but I need a shtick.

1	@Julie_B92 @PlanetDr portably we are supposed to observe stuff ;)
1	@PlanetDr Can I *heat* the planet? ;&gt;
1	@PlanetDr My first response to this question is "pop it" which is why it is good I'm not a planetary scientist.
1	@carylgronwall @JohnDebes website online next week - the two days after June AAS
1	@GoAstroMo Other options... Larry  Curly  and Moe :D
1	@GoAstroMo I mean you have three just on faculty  right? Probably they need to just go by middle names ;&gt;
-1	@GoAstroMo I do not think we have one at UW! Columbia was a bit greedy maybe...
1	@GoAstroMo @thegayYA Right??? Let's talk about the best way to execute but... SO HERE FOR IT.
1	@JohnDebes I would love a load of senior-ish men make it a "can't miss" place to be in June 2017.
1	@JohnDebes ;&gt; I'd *love* for men to schedule WiA on the calendars (directly following the Summer AAS in Austin)
1	@JohnDebes Certainly not on the panel. I'm not even sure where we'd find any that were qualified to speak on the issue.
1	@noah_anyname Because it is the kind of thing that only works is everyone is in on the joke together. So its helping with humour.
1	@GoAstroMo Can we do this at WiA? Maybe a panel on "White Men &amp; Science - Strange Bedfellows". https://t.co/juNUetad86
1	@DrMRFrancis Austin has delicious airport breakfast tacos. This is a solved problem.
1	@PlanetDr 😂😂😂
1	@PlanetDr yay  so you can definitely fit in 15 minutes of writing. ;) Where to?
-1	@PlanetDr send me words #merciless
1	@gravitate_to_me oh no. Oh  I know him. God
1	@upulie Spectra and gels often look similar (my husband is a biochemist :D)
1	@PlanetDr I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.
-1	@nhuntwalker Tragic  really. #TurningPoints
1	@shannonmstirone *hugs* We're going to make it.
1	@thetrudz Right  he's just making sure he's setting out the flags for his folks to pick up later.
-1	@PlanetDr I think they've both been told to take it down a notch. Also  Anderson Cooper isn't trucking ANY nonsense.
1	@BenneHolwerda Well  now I've got forms to fill out  and have to talk to the princiapl. So I guess that was inevitable.
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI Racism  homophobia  transphobia  anti-Semitism... Slow to sink  I fear.
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI I mean  even if Trump doesn't win  this has brought a lot of hate in many guises to the surface.
1	@Mad_Science_Guy @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI I think the question will be - what happens when the election is over?
1	@Mad_Science_Guy @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI Yeah. Jews - Only white till things get pressed.
1	@dalcantonJD @PlanetDr I just realized I really appreciated on a telecon today  and wanted them to know
1	@nhuntwalker @dalcantonJD @caseycourval But their jobs are not "Present this worksheet  today".
-1	@nhuntwalker @dalcantonJD @caseycourval Sure. Teachers can not carry the burden of every student every day.
-1	@dalcantonJD @nhuntwalker gonna have to say - current approach locally appears catastrophically poor
-1	@dalcantonJD @nhuntwalker right. Teachers committed to overheads and worksheets won't magically adapt.
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy @nhuntwalker I wildly disagree.
-1	@nhuntwalker general math literacy is low  teachers panic because it isn't what they are used to  it is poorly explained.
1	@nhuntwalker nope. It's great. People hate it because they don't understand math. I love it.
1	@nhuntwalker I don't think you teach to the middle. I think clustering skill groups within a class is crucial.
1	@nhuntwalker but it is possible  and common core is literally built for it
1	@astrobellatrix @DanaSchwartzzz *hugs*
1	@thetrudz He's been elected before  so he at least has to be passable  I guess? He can make sentences. #HighBar
1	@starstryder Like  did it work last time? I feel like it didn't work last time.
1	@DrMRFrancis And people are so old that apparently they won't even know it happened. So.
-1	@DrMRFrancis I think its just that the Nobel has decreased in its relevance. It isn't that much money. The way they pick is a disaster.
1	@KnudJahnke I mean  tradition would have it they wait at least 10 years.
1	@KnudJahnke Yeah  it seems *pretty* likely people knew before the announcement.
-1	@ZJemptv @AnaMardoll It is weird  but if you don't ruin your children by inflicting a strict gender binary the world gets less confusing.
1	@sondy Oh right! These are your new toys. YES! OMG  I just drove by White Sands like a week ago. *bounce* So excited.

1	@cfroning @SCTrager @shaka_lulu Your grandchildren better bring them back from their travels for you OR ELSE.
1	@shaka_lulu @FRANK_OKAY IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY.
1	@shaka_lulu I'm going a bit Madeline Albright.
1	@shaka_lulu Well that would be AMAZING. I suddenly find myself hoarding lapel pins.
1	@shaka_lulu Have you never met Jewish old people? ;&gt; Tchotchkes are a key feature.
1	@PlanetDr OH MY GOD ME TOO. I keep trying to pick off little jobs and then get pulled into the vortex. At least I'm West Coast.
-1	@PlanetDr I still have not figured out a path to settle the fuck down.
-1	@PlanetDr Oh my god  she is me at every sexist encounter I have ever had.
1	@_sarahmartell_  I KNOW. Haunted by misogyny of labs past.
-1	@prgrmr42 @CatherineQ @PlanetDr @Summer_Ash Married white ladies fuck up the country every time with our voting. I should know.
1	@CatherineQ @PlanetDr @Summer_Ash https://t.co/c0kDAZTKpB
1	@PlanetDr @CatherineQ @Summer_Ash Obviously none of us have ever been in analogous situations.
1	@PlanetDr @CatherineQ @Summer_Ash the infuriating thing is he's basically making progress because people feel bad she's so competent
-1	@CatherineQ @Summer_Ash @PlanetDr Right. Like  if she performs well  he's victimized  if she stumbles AT ALL  she's underperformed.
-1	@Summer_Ash @PlanetDr I don't think anything about torturing yourself with that will give you that insight.
1	@PlanetDr @Summer_Ash Like  maybe I'll just watch "Zooptopia" instead.
-1	@callanbentley @seis_matters @jetdillo @geosociety our prof societies need to start acknowledging they are failing in their role as advocate
-1	@callanbentley @seis_matters @jetdillo @geosociety this is inevitable reinforcement of societal norms under guise of compliance

1	@demitrimuna We've got these sprawling billion dollar projects and huge depts. but act like we're paupers. It is good to call us to account.
-1	@demitrimuna I think a lot of us this comes down to us imagining the field as "underdogs" - and then failing to value work appropriately.
1	@demitrimuna I was at Python for Astronomers this spring and had a chat with Erik about management/structure stuff moving forward.
1	@demitrimuna I figured if I was going to sign  the least I could do was proofread it. :&gt;

1	@sondy the color scheme distracts  but it was clean and pretty comfy
1	@PeterDEdmonds @kahoakes @AstroKatie @DawnHFoster @GoAstroMo ahhhhhhhhhh. Now it all makes sense.
-1	@hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI Yeah  there are days when you wouldn't even have to give me a shove. I'd do it for the world moving forward.
1	@hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI Is the way this works we just give Chanda our passports to hold  just in case?
-1	@rhaegal @astrobellatrix awww. I'm sorry this resonated.
1	@SCTrager @GrumpyKelson @kevinschawinski Isn't it cozy down there  Kelson? ;&gt;
-1	@loonunit @kevinschawinski Accidental death &amp; dismemberment. CLOSE.
-1	@merrdiff It was health/dental/retirement basically.
1	@merrdiff I had one question  but it turns out the answer was "Shrug  follow your bliss" soooo...
1	@merrdiff I'm not sure I'd recommend it. Maybe all of us new hires should have a cup of coffee and chat?
1	@kevinschawinski Funny story: Brazil is based around a clerical error around my last name.
-1	@kevinschawinski Now we are hearing stories of people's death and how they filled out the forms wrong and didn't get money.
-1	@kevinschawinski hahahahaha. NO. Accidental DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT.

1	@DrMel_T This sounds like something @tanyamonro would know a lot about  or would be able to refer you on?
1	@astrokatey No such thing exists.
-1	@astrokatey Yes  was an accidental RT  quickly reversed!
1	@astrokatey What's the context?
-1	@kejames We already sat with him and watched the leaked video together  explaining what was said and why it was wrong.
1	@kejames He says "I want to be there the moment a woman clinches the Presidency."
1	@kejames We are letting our 13-year-old stay up specially for the whole thing.

1	@stoutde @KarenLMasters That sounds great! Do you have a reference for that?

1	@jegpeek looks awesome!!
1	@Robotbeat @markmccaughrean @Astro_Adept @Jane_MacArthur the point is engage with *your* agency  don t just tell them s'one else is better.
1	@Robotbeat @markmccaughrean @Astro_Adept @Jane_MacArthur why does this always devolve into "who is better"?!
1	@astro_adept @markmccaughrean @jane_macarthur yes I think the real work is with ESA but media attention often more focused on what NASA does
1	@markmccaughrean @jane_macarthur @esa especially now that ESA have a base in UK. you should volunteer someone Mark!
1	@adrianprw @jegpeek just fill in the form already! 😀
1	@markmccaughrean @esa @drpetra thanks for the correction Mark!
1	@MikeWJZ @cbsbaltimore how long till it quiets down?!
1	@niais @jegpeek (I had to dictionary shtick)
1	@niais @jegpeek you have plenty of shtick :-)
1	@reneehlozek it's *almost* like something somewhere went right!
1	This looks awesome. #DtU cc @jegpeek https://t.co/t1l4onWZrP
1	@astrocrawford @nick_nwright @brunomerin the number is higher than I’d have guessed  but not surprised it’s a very significant fraction
1	@gravitate_to_me 😓big name in instrumentation…
1	@tcratius @vrooje @mikamckinnon I have no problem with you joining the convo but yeah  I find “gals” quite patronizing.
1	@tcratius @vrooje @mikamckinnon &amp; many times humanity went to “explore” it didn’t end so well  so these topics are not entirely unrelated.
-1	@tcratius @vrooje @mikamckinnon we “gals” have room in our brains to worry about all those things too!
1	@benneholwerda that will have to wait. but pure parallels will be available for C1 for any 2-instrument combination.
1	@benneholwerda OK yes. You may need to wait to Cycle 2 then. @te_pickering
1	@benneholwerda you’re right that MIRI + NIRCam imaging will be available for C1  plus a few other combos @te_pickering
1	@benneholwerda you may however need NIRCam pre-imaging for your MOS observations but that’s not a “parallel” @te_pickering
1	@benneholwerda afaik NIRSpec MOS+ NIRcam coordinated parallel likely to be available for Cycle 2.  @te_pickering
1	@markmccaughrean wow that's beautiful
1	@karinavoggel @michelle_lmc and also hat &amp; gloves go a long way in keeping you warm  and can easily be stowed in a waistband
1	@karinavoggel @michelle_lmc have you got long sleeves you can tie around your waist? or a friendly spectator you can hand clothes too?
-1	@michelle_lmc @karinavoggel I hate being too warm so I’d rather be a bit chilly at the start than too hot later on.
1	@natadastra @astro_adept for science/research there are also NASA fellowship schemes and places like STScI.
1	@natadastra @astro_adept yes that’s correct. though NASA also work with contractors &amp; rules may be more flexible there.
1	@markmccaughrean *cough*JWST*cough*
1	@astro_adept I’m not actually employed in the US  I work for @esa.
1	@astro_adept but generally American people are genuinely welcoming and helpful. def a contrast with other countries I’ve lived in.
1	@astro_adept I have to say moving to the US has been v easy. I am obvsly very privileged with good job &amp; visa  no language issues …
1	@eteq these talks are recorded at ST right?
1	@astro_adept and also to create rules to get the number they want.
-1	@astro_adept well I can’t compare; just seems shortsighted to shut the UK off from the huge EU labour market.
-1	@astro_adept @jareelskaj though I’ve never heard of US companies having to report about their numbers of foreign workers
1	@astro_adept @jareelskaj good Q - not so familiar with the US immigration system. I work for a treaty org so it’s easier for me in US.
1	@planetdr this is true  though would a reviewer know necessarily? not sure if the info is on the proposal. they may know the PI of course.
1	@r_d_alexander @Matt_Burleigh @ProfMike_M I would be okay with that!
1	@ProfMike_M @Matt_Burleigh yes Mayor  Queloz &amp; 3rd would be likely. If at all  that is.
-1	@AstroKatie @michelle_lmc possibly just a systematic error
1	@govender I'm going to quote you on that 😉
1	@govender would love to see that talk  having been told recently by senior person that "impact is impossible to measure"
1	Excellent PhD programs advertising on this months job register https://t.co/m95G7Fd7N6 cc @michealjroberts
1	@gravitate_to_me I think Avi Loeb has already written a paper about that too
1	@jen_gupta like the last servicing mission when we all spent a week watching the live feed!
1	@michealjroberts @vrooje but there are so many people who will never have that opportunity. seriously.
-1	@michealjroberts @vrooje I understand you feel disillusioned  and you're right that there are many problems in our system.
1	@michealjroberts @vrooje with all due respect  if you have degree in physics in the UK you are incredibly fortunate.
1	@michealjroberts consider applying for a young grad trainee scheme eg at @esa; @stsci are also recruiting heavily  PhD not always req.
1	@michealjroberts @vrooje big data has also made astronomy more inclusive for ppl with families  disabilities  less $ etc.
1	@michealjroberts @vrooje 👋 I'm right here. Building instruments.
-1	@michealjroberts @vrooje and I've certainly lost count of all the rejections I've received over my career.
1	@michealjroberts @vrooje maybe useful to note that I and many other prof astronomers worked in non-academic jobs for yrs before our PhDs.
1	@michealjroberts sure open debate but I’m in an important meeting right now; we all have the right not to engage.
1	@michealjroberts because with a degree in physics/astro you can go into SO MANY careers and the country benefits as a whole.
1	@michealjroberts … though note I’ve only spent 2 of last 10 yrs working in UK so I’m not the expert (in US now).
-1	@michealjroberts in astro a huge fraction of UK postdocs are funded on EU grants; that is a worry now I think
1	@michealjroberts astro PhDs can easily (&amp; should) go into non-academic careers  for postdocs gets harder.
-1	@michealjroberts it’s dangerous funding more PhD &amp; postdoc positions if no permanent jobs for them to go to.
1	@michealjroberts @DrJoVian yes. I'm pretty sure ultimately the govt want return to the economy  not a bigger army of astronomers.
1	@michealjroberts @DrJoVian @SotonAstrodome astronomy inspires technology  arts  education  beyond getting more ppl into Astro PhDs.
1	@michealjroberts @DrJoVian @SotonAstrodome the purpose of outreach is much broader than making new astronomers.
1	@michealjroberts @robertmmassey as a professional scientist  I don’t like the assumption that I will do engagement work “for free”
1	@michealjroberts @robertmmassey someone is still paying for it - just not the visitors.
1	@michealjroberts @robertmmassey public engagement  “for free”? are you kidding?
1	@lachlanmartin @profmike_m @astrokatie yes I find them a bit clunky too but sometimes imposed by management and is at least a neutral term.
1	@profmike_m @astrokatie @lachlanmartin in project accounting we often use FTEs; “resources” is also useful and not to hard to diff from $.
1	@astrotweeps also “darm” in Dutch &amp; German means “intestine” which is far more entertaining.
1	@astrotweeps 👋! hope it’s an exciting event.
1	ESA Sky will soon include #JWST footprints says @BrunoMerin ! #esajwst16
1	last talk of #esajwst16 is from @BrunoMerin on ESASky https://t.co/aJ0CVAwVYk - @esa’s new tool for archives &amp; data viz
1	@vealslab a technique to study the environments around stars - like disks  or planets - by blocking the light from the star itself.
1	@markmccaughrean thanks Mark :)
1	@markmccaughrean here's me tweeting my a*** off from an ESA conference  and that's the tweet you reply to? 🙄😉
1	@sleepypenguin1 you can watch online  the link is here (day 2 today) &gt; https://t.co/sv6ekI3hhR
1	@jegpeek @desikanarayanan @acooray @benneholwerda @karinsandstrom imagining what a useful phrase “let it go” is in project meetings…
1	@jegpeek @desikanarayanan @acooray @BenneHolwerda @karinsandstrom would there be trademark issues for that?!
1	In praise of small astronomy - wise words and/or food for thought from @ProfMike_M https://t.co/1CWaHogfk2
1	@BrunoMerin do we have a hashtag for this conference? if not  #esajwst16?
1	@astrobellatrix @drarnakarick @demitrimuna OK thanks wasn't aware of the background
1	@astrobellatrix but casa for ALMA uses Python no? @drarnakarick @demitrimuna
1	@drarnakarick @demitrimuna no idea re Keck. I know ESO use python  presume astropy too. not sure what uptake in radio is (apart from ALMA).
1	@drarnakarick @demitrimuna good point! JWST is a big user.
1	@markmccaughrean are there any events planned at estec on the 30th?
1	see you soon @debbie_how @astrocrawford  @HighzHodge @LordGarretson @mattkenworthy @carolune @govender and all at the ESAC #JWST workshop!
1	@jegpeek it was advertised on the Talks list a few weeks ago but now has its own list. Weds at 1:30 @eteq @mubdirahman
-1	@eteq yes me too thanks to my stupid cough @jegpeek @mubdirahman
1	@eteq @jegpeek maybe a good topic for one of the new JHU visualization meetings!
-1	@michelle_lmc it was getting better and then got worse again. 😞
1	@markmccaughrean I will be wearing a sign saying "NOT INFECTIOUS"
1	@markmccaughrean oh they will know.
1	@starstryder I take pride in being extra scruffy in business class :)
-1	@eteq @npr247 @astropy @brettmor @dalcantonjd that would be my concern too with that model
-1	@jradavenport @brettmor @nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd  @demitrimuna are sadly a LOT of astro’s whose “community” extends only to their own grp
-1	@demitrimuna @nhuntwalker @jradavenport @dalcantonjd @brettmor of course I agree - just stating concerns with alternative models
1	@nhuntwalker @demitrimuna @jradavenport @dalcantonjd @brettmor what they see as useful to their people  not broader community [2/2]
-1	@nhuntwalker @demitrimuna @jradavenport @dalcantonjd @brettmor of course. but I’d worry that institutes would only want to support [1/2]
1	@demitrimuna @jradavenport @nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @brettmor Arxiv is a different kind of service no? v important  but different from code
1	@jradavenport @nhuntwalker @demitrimuna @dalcantonjd @brettmor if institutions are paying into “membership” they may also want more control
1	@chrislintott could a UK institute apply for community software  positions via the consolidated grant? @brettmor @demitrimuna
1	. @demitrimuna wrote a good paper on the problem with community software in astro. read it! &gt;&gt; https://t.co/FY28dOrgMt
1	@jr_pritchard I feel quite conflicted that this is how we find out about this stuff now (don’t doubt that it’s true though)
-1	@michelle_lmc no push ups required to drive that bad boy.
1	@astrotweeps that's really interesting. What kind of teaching?
1	@davidwhogg @dstndstn @michelle_lmc @astrofrog I agree!
1	@michelle_lmc that is an awesome picture of you!!
1	@dstndstn @michelle_lmc @astrofrog yes those eye-roll people are just dicks.
1	@michelle_lmc yes I think it’s hotter where you are at the moment than here! I will try to get in a few km this evening.
1	@michelle_lmc the weather is definitely getting more pleasant for running. still hot but now cool in the mornings at least.
-1	@michelle_lmc 2+ weeks  slowly getting better now. a nasty South African bug 😠
-1	@michelle_lmc yes it gets a bit silly. I deleted my RK account and everything is connected to each other.
-1	@michelle_lmc (says the one not currently doing ANYTHING due to stupid cough)
1	@michelle_lmc you’re on Strava? come find me!
1	@jegpeek @desikanarayanan @benneholwerda @conselice me too!
1	@astrotweeps @astro_liz it’s A&amp;A
1	@vrooje @Summer_Ash @emilylurice @jegpeek I agree. If we're naming it after people Leavitt is a good choice.
1	@janerrigby @te_pickering @astrotweeps yes that would be really useful
1	@dalcantonjd @astrotweeps saw it demonstrated recently too and it is really impressive!
1	@_hroe @astro_jje @astronomolly @JohnDebes no excuses you should all apply (not you Molly)
1	@astrokatey (but in the NIR)
1	@astrotweeps @astrokatey HARMONI &amp; METIS are both 1st generation E-ELT instruments for your IR IFU needs.
1	@astrokatey another MUSE!
1	@astronomolly @PlanetDr yes some pretty great sunsets at the moment https://t.co/ikdvmnc6be
1	@PlanetDr there are taco trucks? in Baltimore?
1	@drarnakarick 😮😦😨😱 fingers crossed!
1	@drarnakarick you're so brave
1	@astrophysaxist @astrobellatrix that sounds awesome! do come up to @stsci some time?
1	@michelle_lmc awesome!!
1	@e_astronomer I didn't care so much that I actually tried to do it :) but yes fun modeling exercise.
1	@AstroBrigi @drarnakarick @becky1505 soon I hope!!
1	@michelle_lmc ha love it. glad it's not just me 😀
1	@astrobellatrix of course! but shouldn’t be taken as a sign that you’re less engaged or competent. and men should have the same option.
1	@ProfMike_M omg you should hear NBC! Makes BBC sound properly intellectual.
1	@astraughnomer @astrokatie +1. they should really add a note about that in gender diversity training.
1	@StellarPlanet @stsci check my timeline
1	@planetdr @astronomolly he was in the stsci lobby but that was an hour ago now. likely that someone has kidnapped him by now - likely me
1	@astronomyblog I’m sorry Stu  sending a big hug. Email me any time.
1	@astronomyblog ??! are you okay?
1	@te_pickering @brianwolven you'd think after 1 bad crash they'd review the safety provisions...
1	@SCTrager @JossBlandHawtho @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick my PhD project was part funded by industry and gave me tons of valuable experience
1	@JossBlandHawtho @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick maybe facilitate movement between academia &amp; industry  in both directions?
1	@Cosmic_Horizons @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick not unless we drastically reduce the number of postdocs!
1	@cosmicpinot @drarnakarick @Cosmic_Horizons that would be a *great* improvement for postdocs
1	@drarnakarick @aagie it does make me glad I went to a girls' school. I think we were slightly more protected from that bias.
1	@kejames she's Han's sister right?
1	@drdasb @telescoper @knudjahnke sure but let’s not mix gastronomy with equestrian sport
-1	@knudjahnke @telescoper ew!
1	@astro_liz @michelle_lmc (and yes I know you 2 were probably still in primary school then 😉)
1	@astro_liz @michelle_lmc hearing all the news about Rio this week makes me nostalgic for my 2 weeks at the IAU there - 7 years ago!! 😱
1	@PlanetDr @BaltimorePolice @BmoreCityDOT saw a few cones but they were scattered away
1	@PlanetDr I just saw a jogger along the water 😳
-1	@PlanetDr it's crazy! So glad I'm not on the road tonight.
1	@zemogle @megschwamb @dotastronomy @becky1505 @chrislintott yup we know...
1	@niais @eilatg @carylgronwall yeah at some point we need to move away from acronyms and just name things!
1	@michelle_lmc Hope the elbow gets better!! I need a 10-hour lie-down now.
-1	Death by push ups at the gym this morning. I dedicated all of them to @michelle_lmc 😀💪
1	@planetdr @astronomolly yeah I guess some areas are prone to flash flooding. hope it clears soon.
1	@PlanetDr  @astronomolly  Fells Point! https://t.co/IlMbvzdd1w
1	@astronomolly @jegpeek it never occurred to me. ha I learnt something new today.
1	@jegpeek @astronomolly interesting I never considered that some people never see thunderstorms!
1	@jegpeek I want to give him a hug now
-1	@michealjroberts he's been a terrible leader.
-1	@michealjroberts Smith? At this point there needs to be an effective opposition. But no don't think he'll deliver it either.
-1	@michealjroberts alas having principles doesn't make you an effective leader
1	@michelle_lmc dinner in the evening but no plans in the daytime! email?
1	@michelle_lmc LSST meeting in Oxford and a day in London on Sunday.
1	@astrocrawford @michelle_lmc oh that sounds easy I'm in!
1	@astrocrawford @michelle_lmc fantastic you guys just need to find a 3rd person for me to cheer on.
1	@michelle_lmc @astrocrawford but 56 is only a tiny bit further than 42...? I'll do 21 so I can have your beer waiting for you 😀
1	@astronomolly @jegpeek yes good news!
1	@michelle_lmc plus I’m sure you can arrange for a few colloquiums so it would totally be a work trip.
1	@michelle_lmc I’ll check with my people but I think this is meant to be good https://t.co/QoBBBSFLPp
1	@michelle_lmc though I hear South Africa has some great races (not just Comrades) if you’re looking for a nice destination!
1	@michelle_lmc not so up to speed in that category - other than some of the famous Alps ones.
1	@michelle_lmc the HD trail marathon? that would be impressive :-)
1	@michelle_lmc you’re doing one?? awesome!
1	@PlanetDr come along some time if you like!
1	@PlanetDr Hammerman beach - beautiful &amp; safe.
1	@PlanetDr especially when great swimming is only a half hour uber away! I hope they get some good antibiotics.
1	@PlanetDr yeah.
-1	@SleepyPenguin1 then I misunderstood - sorry.
-1	@SleepyPenguin1 wasn't meant as a religious expression just concern for colleagues. also calling religious people dumb is really stupid.
-1	@planetdr @astronomolly @laurawatkins_ unfortunately in many places there is zero support for publication charges.
1	@planetdr @astronomolly @laurawatkins_  yes my experience is generally v good too
1	@ProfMike_M wow yes - big news and the timing is interesting.
1	@PlanetDr oh that's the theme? I was impressed at so many space-themed events! Planning a visit tomorrow.
1	@astronomyblog yes different situations but there are definitely parallels
-1	@astronomyblog for me it's more that any attempt at balanced discussion about science was shouted down by angry anti-EU folks
1	@sctrager @benneholwerda @knudjahnke ha that’s 2 tweets with the same recommendation - definitely checking them out. thanks Scott!
1	@jonathansick @benneholwerda @knudjahnke oh thanks - unsolicited input v v welcome!
1	@benneholwerda @knudjahnke yes my trusty @timbuk2 bag is falling apart and after some research am concluding they are still my fav choice
1	@knudjahnke well I don’t think carrying my laptop around every day is particularly “fun” but my job requires it.
1	@knudjahnke am looking for a new laptop bag and is striking across the board that women’s bags: fun/impractical  men’s bags: work/functional
1	@knudjahnke no no not that. I meant “women all over the world tae their laptops to work” (tho knew that was prob not what you meant)
1	@knudjahnke all over the world  Knud!
1	@michelle_lmc she's so amazing
1	@telescoper @geerthub wave from Brussels! enjoy your stay  Ghent is wonderful!
1	@astronomyblog @orbitingfrog I know!
1	@astronomolly @NatureNews bendy mirrors break #threewordthesis
1	@ProfMike_M @NGC3314 @astronomolly agree entirely!
1	@ngc3314 @astronomolly @profmike_m + if I have to do an hr of research to understand the point of your proposal  you’re wasting my time.
-1	@ngc3314 @astronomolly @profmike_m well if it’s v poorly written then I can’t judge the science. but I’ve had arguments about this.
1	@astronomolly @profmike_m don’t assume your reviewers know your exact field. I’m perfectly competent but I do need *some* context! (2/2)
1	@astronomolly @profmike_m having served on a small TAC though I do think it’s an important lessons for PIs (1/2)
1	@markmccaughrean @dstndstn @geerthub @benneholwerda fyi early release science with #JWST will have 0 prop.
-1	@vrooje @BenneHolwerda yeah they were just treading water. leadership not credible which becomes a big problem in a big crisis.
1	Hey @startorialist do you like @astrocrawford and his magic science kilt? Feat. @NoTruerAlien &amp; myself #spiehack https://t.co/JKmz3lBQJL
1	@spietweets 5 pm I hope!
1	@spietweets @womeninoptics excellent thanks!
1	👏 for quick action. hope extended to all @SPIEtweets conferences? https://t.co/hjy6t3vX3w
1	@michelle_lmc  @eteq "Minnesota Michelle" has quite a nice ring to it no?
1	@niais @KnudJahnke definitely 😒
-1	sorry mis-tweeted earlier; obviously anyone can go to the @SPIEtweets poster sessions but people with kids have reported being turned away.
1	@niais @KnudJahnke so not a venue/insurance  thing?
1	@DrJoVian @markmccaughrean ha ha yes  poor buggers ⚽️😓
1	@markmccaughrean @DrJoVian well right now we're still in everything!
1	Construction of housing for crew building @GMTelescope at Las Campanas has begun - they'll have a nice view - McCarthy #SPIEastro
1	@BenneHolwerda @AstroKatie @mattkenworthy @astrocrawford @upbeatprof only that I'm kind of happier when I'm not on a plane
1	@ProfMike_M don't leave us Mike!
1	@michealjroberts well their priority is the human cost of its member states. UK people have chosen out of EU protection.
-1	@michealjroberts I think it was naive of Leavers to ever think otherwise. The EU isn't going to be vindictive but has to maintain unity.
1	@Nate_Cohn @PlanetDr my feelings exactly
-1	@orbitingfrog @vrooje @aagie @becky1505 sorry to miss you Rob!!
1	@drarnakarick @kellecruz @chrislintott I think I missed part of this convo but definitely in favour.
1	@eteq good question &amp; not sure of answer. cc @BrunoMerin !
1	@teagazer @demitrimuna @ashpags @merrdiff @kellecruz advertise how? we always have examples of non-code hacks whenever we list or present.
1	@ashpags or what Demitri said (catching up on thread…) @teagazer @merrdiff @demitrimuna @kellecruz
1	@ashpags turn it round: what would make you want to come? @teagazer @merrdiff @demitrimuna @kellecruz
1	@mattkenworthy @merrdiff @kellecruz it’s not just coding though - that would reinforce the image even more!
1	@mattkenworthy @merrdiff @kellecruz oh really?! Do you have any suggestions?
1	@merrdiff @kellecruz I would def like to hear from people who feel this way about #dotastro to learn how we can do better
1	@merrdiff @kellecruz hope this is not our image  we always work hard to get a mix of skills  backgrounds and returning vs new #dotastro
1	@njgoldbaum @kellecruz still working out details so not announcing anything yet but most likely not Europe/N America
1	@markmccaughrean actual cats &amp; dogs falling out of the sky in UK
1	@markmccaughrean oh I expect I'll be doing that too 😀
1	@markmccaughrean and I will be decamping to S Africa for a good part of August to avoid east coast summer
-1	@markmccaughrean I don't entirely disagree with you Mark but today is particularly obnoxious!!
1	@markmccaughrean @ScienceNelson @MonicaGrady @SpaceKate ha no one told me that in the interview :)
1	@PlanetDr good luck!
1	@PlanetDr eep what time is that for?!
1	@markmccaughrean thanks for the tip Mark! sadly had plans already.
1	@michelle_lmc impressive collection :) have fun!!
1	@drarnakarick but I think there are definitely ways of gaining the benefits w/o the downsides eg shared positions  short stints abroad etc
-1	@drarnakarick I'm a bit ambivalent about it as I've gained so much from living in different countries
1	@michelle_lmc yes I don't see why they can't have the attractive privileges for members' partners but make it gender neutral!
-1	@philipbull @jr_pritchard yes building an international observatory could def qualify as a "global challenge" imo!
1	@benneholwerda @te_pickering @aallan I’m trying out OneNote which is now free.
1	@te_pickering @benneholwerda @aallan well it’s been great for many years…..
-1	@benneholwerda @aallan worrying noises about company health.
1	@aallan I’m trying out OneNote  understand it can import under some OS but not sure about OSX. using both in parallel for now.
1	@aallan have you been able to migrate easily? and to what? am considering doing the same.
1	@markmccaughrean great I am arriving just after 11 pm.
1	@markmccaughrean oh are you coming to Victoria this week?
1	@PlanetDr @astronomolly hope you packed your sunscreen this morning
1	@e_astronomer "newly licensed at 35" I guess is interpreted as "omg took her 20 years to pass her driving test?!"
-1	@PlanetDr argh my eyes!
-1	@planetdr weather forecast for next 2 days on the radio this morning was “hellfire and damnation”.  😞
1	cc @michelle_lmc  https://t.co/nc2WORbiFv
1	@chrislintott @jegpeek I think ADASS was quite good in that regard last year  to be fair.
1	@dstndstn @jegpeek @augustmuench @jonathansick don’t know the details TBH  just saw tweets!
1	@jegpeek @augustmuench @dstndstn @jonathansick note there’s currently an IVOA meeting ongoing. send suggestions that way? #ivoa2016
1	@planetdr @kat_volk @hauck can you train him (her) to nod in agreement whenever you’re talking?
-1	@planetdr @hauck @kat_volk I would hate to have telecons with video  especially the ones I take from my bed.
1	@markmccaughrean seriously? east coast weather beats uk weather by 3 orders of magnitude. Just not today.
1	@astronomolly @laurawatkins_ @biphenyl oh so you need to buy the domain  not the actual hosting?
1	@astronomolly @biphenyl https://t.co/bLw9a1B9r7
1	@astronomolly @biphenyl ok. for my own domain I use laughing squid  they are not the cheapest but good ethos and decent support.
1	@planetdr yes not a good day to be on a bike at 6 am.
1	. @SenatorBarb does give good science banter - good speech :-) https://t.co/1Zu8ytRT6f
1	@cosmos4u @mpoessel there are many simple wordings that would convey the more international nature of the mission better
1	@markmccaughrean well exactly.
1	@markmccaughrean oh wait you’re right! I was so pleased to see even a *mention* of ESA &amp; CSA :-) MIRI is half JPL…
1	@markmccaughrean that is partly the reason I’m sure but the largest IT company in the world needs to do better.
-1	@markmccaughrean yes I know there are ways around it but it’s 2016 ffs  surely they can fix this?
1	hey instrumentatlists/coders: have you signed up for the @SPIEtweets #hackday in Edinburgh yet? https://t.co/ln6E25fpQP
1	@planetdr sure always happy with company! when &amp; where do you normally run? (or email me)
1	have you signed up yet for the @SPIEtweets #hackday in Edinburgh?! come join us &gt;&gt; https://t.co/TQ6Gu16be1
1	@markmccaughrean I hear you but it sure is very very comfy.
1	@markmccaughrean obviously I would like some kind of collaboration between @esa and @rapha on this :-) @jarimakinen
1	@drarnakarick I can help with runs in/near London and Oxford!  @astrocrawford
1	astronomers &amp; engineers! if @SPIEtweets Edinburgh is in your calendar  come join us for Hack Day &gt;&gt; https://t.co/P1abjPcUkK
1	@markmccaughrean F version would be great thanks :-)
1	@markmccaughrean me! @esa
1	if you're coming to the @SPIEtweets Astronomical Telescopes in June  join the Hack Day on Thursday! https://t.co/QFvnSwB9Sq
1	@brendonbrewer that would make sense!
1	@startorialist  you are amazing. @astro_Liz @CustomShoeShop
1	@astro_Liz are you allowed to bling them up? Sounds like a good @startorialist challenge!
1	@startorialist @astronomolly love it! you should market your brand by introducing Startorialist *Days at institutes.
1	@astronomolly @startorialist oh like "no flip flops" friday :-)
1	@astronomolly @startorialist they come in in formal wear?!
1	@astronomolly should we introduce formal Fridays at the institute? @startorialist
-1	@PlanetDr likewise "this is probably politically incorrect but...."
-1	@michelle_lmc but that seems to be the council's argument (from reading the quote on the BBC article)
-1	@michelle_lmc yes exactly. I could understand if it were a for-profit organisation but as it's not it's a stupid decision.
-1	@michelle_lmc I think the idea is they want to charge parkrun the organisation  right?
1	@markmccaughrean you're still eligible?
1	@karinavoggel @michelle_lmc even in high-crime cities you can live a pretty normal and relaxed life  as long as you're a little careful
1	@karinavoggel @michelle_lmc those 2 cities are particularly bad. you'll be fine!
1	@PlanetDr I haven't seen those yet but good tip to avoid that one.
1	@astraughnomer that's amazing  congratulations!
-1	@jegpeek argh sorry to miss it! slow drive back from Goddard tonight @astronomolly @willowdower @astronomyontap @faketumlinson
1	@startorialist yes sorry that's what I meant - thank you my day is MADE :-)
1	dear god #spacepants @startorialist https://t.co/hpqnbBTOXB
1	neural network prediction of galaxy morph's using @galaxyzoo data by @sedielem &amp; @kwwillett  (2015) https://t.co/rFsnOnFWpQ cc @jegpeek
1	@brendonbrewer yes interesting - thanks!
1	@michelle_lmc good luck and have fun!! will be thinking of you :-)
1	@michelle_lmc is it this weekend??
1	@PlanetDr I'm in Bloomberg
1	@PlanetDr thankfully my own coffee machine should be arriving any day now...
-1	@drjovian @michelle_lmc I've heard this before actually - crazy
1	@markmccaughrean good to know!
-1	@markmccaughrean I'm going to miss working on ground-based instruments! No trips to Garching for a while...
-1	@astrotweeps I've had people look nervously at me and say "this is not for tweeting".
1	@markmccaughrean I may need a raise for one of those…
1	@markmccaughrean I agree but I'm trying to stay alive until the #JWST launch and my employer has posted me to Baltimore.
1	@mggtTaylor very soon I'm sure 👍
1	@mggtTaylor excellent! Come visit your friends in Baltimore some time :)
1	@mggtTaylor what's next Matt?
1	@albertoconti great picture team!
1	@jegpeek absolutely  am around
1	@jegpeek no I'll be back tonight. house move tomorrow!
1	@albertoconti this morning?! mine was pretty bad too but no booze
-1	and cc @jegpeek for this paper: Sick  the spectroscopic inference crank https://t.co/jOegtuFv1o
1	@planetdr yes hi I am here :-) thanks for the tip! need ALL the local recommendations.
1	@planetdr got good hairdresser tips for Baltimore?
1	@jegpeek @kwwillett 👍 might quote you on that
1	@brunomerin yikes I have to update my details for this!! @sxsw2016
-1	@astrogrant have to say I got a little distracted by the dogs to listen to what you were saying. was that the point? @astronomolly @eteq
1	@SleepyPenguin1 I haven't used it actually. I'm not sure many professional astronomers do but does have some great functionality afaik.
1	@geerthub it's true  it's not far. but also snow and ice in winter.
1	@kevinschawinski thanks Kevin!
1	@e_astronomer I use Jekyll and you don't really need to know Ruby for it. only a few commands for installation.
1	@chris_tibbs @brendonbrewer  thanks!
1	@geerthub thanks I am recharging my batteries in the homeland for a few days before I fly. 🍟🍺
1	@sleepypenguin1 thanks!
1	@michelle_lmc @surreyastro it's a gorgeous night for some observing!
1	@kevinschawinski yup yup
1	@kevinschawinski yup!
1	@astrotweeps it had a honeycomb backing too no?
1	enjoying Matt's @astrotweeps stories of Roger Angel &amp; Steward mirror labs. fab technology and worth a visit if you have the opportunity.
1	@davidwhogg @sctrager @melissakness @astrowizicist @jegpeek and I want to hear about all this at a conf at @stsci next year. more soon :-)
1	@jegpeek I have some moving chaos to deal with here and definitely looking forward to being on the other side of that now :-)
-1	@mad_science_guy @drskyskull #WTFfoodorigins uncle Bob died from eating this shark  maybe if we let it rot for a while it will be ok?
1	@mad_science_guy or oh look coffee berries in the poo of these cats  bet that will taste good @drskyskull @drskyskull
1	@megschwamb oooh congrats Meg!
1	@michelle_lmc mais bien sur! and in astro  all roads lead to Baltimore these days :-)
1	@michelle_lmc OMG you didn't mention the push ups to me!! that is BIG news! :-)
1	@merrdiff congrats!!
1	interesting! RT @jjkavelaars: @astrotweeps like @astrokiwi says. Underfunded data projects is CANFARs speciality.
1	@startorialist  https://t.co/h2m1HS9Wuv
1	@te_pickering sure - big overseas move is a difference sort of company than overland move. @astro_liz @benneholwerda @khesser
-1	@te_pickering my quote from them (for much shorter int'l move) was insane. 3x higher than anyone else @astro_liz @benneholwerda @khesser
1	@pedroperos exactly
-1	@pedroperos but sure  many things wrong with the way the immigration debate is going.
1	@pedroperos I guess the argument is that people with genuine "need" aren't immigrants  they're asylum seekers.
1	@niais you have mine! @mathematigal @planetdr @hubbahubble @princsssuprnova @intrplnetsarah @milkysa
1	@niais there must be an overlap :-) @wikisteff @mathematigal @planetdr @hubbahubble @princsssuprnova @intrplnetsarah @milkysa
1	@niais we need a Venn diagram of our interests @wikisteff @mathematigal @planetdr @hubbahubble @princsssuprnova @intrplnetsarah @milkysa
1	This looks interesting cc @govender @astrocrawford  https://t.co/3Z3CWlmQk2
1	Ah this is excellent news. Congrats @govender and @Astro4Dev! https://t.co/MvftnsHoI4
1	today I'm giving the seminar at @imperialcollege on my simulations of high-z galaxy observations with E-ELT/HARMONI.
1	@drarnakarick @becky1505 and well remembered! hope you will join us.
1	@drarnakarick no way! the Lexa and I have had way too much fun. ditto the ski gear.
-1	@benneholwerda solves the problem right there  no?
1	@benneholwerda only after filling in the first 10 forms I realised I'd misread a number on my new address. drink *10.
1	@michelle_lmc high five for winter sun :-)
1	@astronomolly @dalcantonJD  I read that tweet like you were talking *about* @planetdr :-)
1	@scorfano @benneholwerda yes that's why provenance is important and there are technical ways to address that. overall still beneficial IMO.
1	@PlanetDr this is why I delayed my move date till spring. so glad I did!
1	@markmccaughrean oh that's a good idea. but will the movers allow it pre-packed? transatlantic move  not allowed to pack myself.
-1	@markmccaughrean yup exactly. might try to find one 2nd hand. my bike isn't that expensive but still worried about shipping it.
1	@markmccaughrean ah thanks! currently investigating best way to get bike across the atlantic safely…
1	@markmccaughrean of course of course  &amp; they are pretty funny
-1	@markmccaughrean have found cyclists on the road &amp; in races way more patronising and sexist than ever had with running though.
-1	@markmccaughrean most of the derogatory terms are pretty gender-specific but sure  not too bad I suppose.
1	@markmccaughrean also no better way to Rule 5 by swimming before your ride  getting on your bike wet  and finishing with a run. There.
1	@markmccaughrean and also  whilst probably funny to insiders  this webpage makes me never want to join a cycling club  ever.
1	@markmccaughrean also cycling geekery really needs to come up to speed with the fact that women cycle too.
1	@markmccaughrean funny but they get a bit silly. definitely lost me at #42!
1	@markmccaughrean ouch! :-/ I still care more about humans than bikes (I know  priorities etc)
1	@markmccaughrean oh no Mark - hope no damage!!
1	@vrooje yes of course  forgot about that one! @e_astronomer @authorea
1	@e_astronomer I think both of those are good options!
1	@markmccaughrean @demitrimuna I think I'll take it as a win anyway (not work-related)
1	@aallan @markmccaughrean exploitation of ESA space missions I mean
1	@aallan @markmccaughrean ... Unless we talk about how EU strengthens our position in ESA  which it does by providing ££ for exploitation
1	@markmccaughrean @aallan I think we should leave ESA out of it tbh
1	@markmccaughrean @aallan there are plenty of good things about the EU  we should focus on those.
-1	@markmccaughrean @aallan misinformation about what the EU is is a big reason this referendum is happening in the first place
-1	@markmccaughrean @aallan more about not spreading misinformation. Its not about Europe  its the EU  and ESA is separate from that
-1	@markmccaughrean @aallan that's a bit dangerous though - too many people already think ESA is an EU body
1	@astronomyblog @jonmbutterworth I think it's a good sign that we're talking about it
1	@stpkav @e_astronomer @astronomyblog so what happens then? No action?
-1	@e_astronomer @astronomyblog of course sexual harassment is just one of many ways you can abuse power &amp; bully people
1	@e_astronomer @astronomyblog maybe even require that sort of metric to be publicly available?
1	@e_astronomer @astronomyblog after reading the Caltech case  looking more closely at # students who don't complete PhDs with a given prof
1	@jr_pritchard you can probably scrap the "nice" too - depending on the postcode.
-1	@geerthub lovely :-) I know how you feel  landed before dawn this morning too. too bad I'll miss you - catch up soon!
1	@geerthub you in town for long? think I'm in London on Weds.
1	@geerthub heard good things about LMNH yes! once it's acceptable time for beer (… 11 am-ish?) I quite like Brewdog.
1	@geerthub got a preferred area? London's big!
-1	@thomasbasboell @shubclimate for example by M. Banaji: https://t.co/shwcNmvXuv (+ link to new book); A. Greenwald: https://t.co/tiAVb4YXUd
1	@shubclimate in any case  I think oversimplifying complex issues (in whatever way) is often what leads to polarising a debate.
1	@shubclimate after all  unconscious bias works on many levels - skin colour  religion  social background  etc.
1	@shubclimate to us as human beings. not something we are deliberately inflicting on one another.
1	@shubclimate @thomasbasboell I don't think so  as long as we frame unconscious bias as something that affects ALL of us and is intrinsic …
1	@shubclimate @thomasbasboell yes there are many good studies. check out Project Implicit at Harvard for example.
1	@shubclimate @efeprat (also aside: women w/o children fare less well than men too  so is not simply a baby issue).
1	@shubclimate @thomasbasboell and mitigate where possible. "gender in science" is just one small aspect of that.
1	@shubclimate @thomasbasboell in ways that perhaps don't lead to the best outcomes for that society as a whole. we have to be aware of that …
1	@shubclimate @thomasbasboell affects our (everyone's!) decision making in numerous ways that affect  who-does-what in society …
1	@shubclimate @thomasbasboell certainly and don't think I did that. but unconscious bias (which was mainly talking about) is well evidenced…
1	@markmccaughrean @alokjha seem to remember Belgium had its own version of Delta plan post-'53 but never completed? (not sure of details tho)
1	@markmccaughrean @alokjha can't watch video as am working but surely the long-term vision and management is pretty unique?
1	@drarnakarick good luck Arna! hope good things on the horizon.
-1	@owlice @drarnakarick oh right - yes I spotted that MNRAS allowed software citations  didn't know AAS was so restrictive about that before
1	@astropixie @astronomyblog seconded Stu  big hug! I quite enjoyed reading this on the subject of insomnia: https://t.co/kYZL4q040g
1	@drarnakarick not sure. maybe they'll wait for AAS to figure out details  then adopt same policy?
-1	@markmccaughrean not sure  staying conservative with sporting resolutions given the big move. suspect cycling culture in US a bit different.
-1	@markmccaughrean ha it's probably quite low. 20 maybe? my cycling is rubbish!
1	@highzhodge @michelle_lmc just saw this tweet - trying to imagine Casey's face!! that's pretty shocking; agree it stops being fun v quickly.
1	@markmccaughrean love screen on the green :-)
-1	@michelle_lmc the problem is that by the time anyone voices discontent  it's v short notice to invite new speakers
1	@vrooje @BenneHolwerda apparently conda is the way fwd these days
1	@jr_pritchard @drjovian oh that's a cool graphic. good one for my public talks.
1	@jr_pritchard @drjovian people who have signed away the next 10 yrs of their life to work on it would prefer you not to discuss this 😕
1	@jegpeek so. many. zeros.
1	@markmccaughrean thanks captain! I have 5 night shifts lined up next  starting on New Years Day.
1	@astraughnomer that is epic!
1	@markmccaughrean maybe not but the #JWST instruments are getting a lot of action over in Goddard at the moment!
1	@astraughnomer good choice #Belgium
-1	@markmccaughrean I had to use a lever as my hands failed so am expecting to find it punctured by morning... #fingerscrossed
-1	@markmccaughrean there was no way I could fit a new tire with bare hands in the cold....
-1	@markmccaughrean needed to replace a tube and a tire and gave it a good clean too. Taken weeks to find time to do it  so bored of the bus!
-1	@markmccaughrean it was really unpleasant for sure. lost feeling in hands so had to bring a few jobs inside.
1	@planetdr sadly I don't work in planetary science  otherwise it would def make more likely to cite you :-)
1	@benneholwerda the bartender @drannawatts @mattkenworthy @astrocrawford
1	@MJIBrown @glyndaviesmp don't god your breath. I am an imaginary academic after all! ;)
1	@chrisenorth @jen_gupta also ~annual trips to family in California kind of put it in perspective.....
1	@chrisenorth @jen_gupta wow that's dedicated. We've always just done the "deal with it" method. They adjust eventually!
1	@jen_gupta @BBCBreakfast it's probably fairly similar. I officially have one big kid though. She's still sleeping! 🙀
1	@jen_gupta it's a reasonable response! ;)
-1	@jen_gupta should I be worried!? ;)
1	@mollhackabout @jen_gupta awesome! Do you want to share his project? Tweet to @UoPCosmology if so. :)
1	This is why we do these things and put so much effort in. @jen_gupta :) https://t.co/xFP7NCxkkt
1	@startorialist they're @TikibooFitness leggings. @SotonAstrodome told me about them I think.
1	You might catch me on @bbc5live in a few minutes talking about #MeteorShower #meteors #Orionids
1	@jen_gupta did Holly leave too?
1	@jen_gupta a change is often a good idea. Its why I occasionally go work in cafes. :)
1	@jr_pritchard thanks. :)
1	@jr_pritchard is it still live - can you tweet me the link?
1	Really hope this isn't another Mars landing failure. Fingers crossed for little Sciaparelli. #exomars @ESA_EDM
1	@nhuntwalker @dalcantonJD @jradavenport @Life_Affirming something which picked up "I'm having a bad day" (etc) and sent virtual hugs maybe?
-1	@BenneHolwerda sorry retweeted with fixed typo in hashtag
1	@ScolesSarah @Annie314159 @galaxyzoo hey @NGC3314 do you have comments here?
1	Think Daily Fashion is going to get s surprise! Although there are @startorialist tweets! https://t.co/dFd4fKobBJ
1	@astrobellatrix yes. The timescale depends on mass. Should have been a "some" on there. If they form they're variety of masses.
1	@realscientists are you sure? I though Mary Somerville was the first woman published by @royalsociety
1	“When Einstein met H.G. Wells” by @StartsWithABang https://t.co/xAeOkLUjjN
-1	@gravitate_to_me @ICGPortsmouth look out for our Dennis Sciama Fellowship advert posted soon. Email me if you're serious! ;)
1	@startorialist from Gap btw who have lots of stars all over clothes labelled "girls 6-14" (in UK outlet shop at least).
1	@startorialist second tweet I remembered to add the photo!
1	At the @portsmouthuni Vice Chancellor Address in beautifully renovated lecture theatre in Park Building. https://t.co/r8B0ETF9rN
-1	@jen_gupta @amattwithers @lecrasc @WinSciCentre @SEPhysics we should photoshop that on @ICGPortsmouth group shot!
1	@ProfMike_M but is "helpful" actually a good thing? E.g. Why women should stop being so helpful at work https://t.co/L1WdkoSnic
1	@ProfMike_M vey consistent across subject (except in fine arts).
-1	@astronomyblog I love that you did this. The result makes me sad/frustrated though. :(
1	@astronomyblog yet again thanks for collecting stats on this. I cannot understand why @MockTheWeek can't manage &gt;1 woman *on same show*.
1	@gravitate_to_me thanks. :)
1	@ProfMike_M yuck. Thanks for explaining.
1	Do you think@we look like geologists? European Night of #volcanos @portsmouthuni https://t.co/WTP630X4JQ
1	Having a hard time summarizing how awesome @jen_gupta is for astronomy outreach in 250 words.... Still  good problem. :)
1	@astrotweeps @esa @ESA_Rosetta awesome. Thanks for sharing the pictures. :)
1	Conversation over breakfast this morning: how amazing it is that Jupiter's Great Red Spot is bigger than Earth. @jen_gupta @amattwithers ;)
1	@manwhohasitall @jen_gupta we don't mind "gentleman astronomer" either....
1	@MJIBrown @amelia_fmc  @RossEHart yeah we see a strong trend for that in @galaxyzoo (but also most spirals have 2 arms  and esp if barred)
-1	@MJIBrown but see Hart et al. (2016) where we suggest they do (slightly diff consensus algorithm/redshift bias): https://t.co/rX6EB36Ruu
1	@MJIBrown intentional mispelling I assume? ;)
-1	@MJIBrown we've also had "I’m not where I wanted to be in the talk  so I will speed up now" BINGO  and public arguing about length...! ;)
1	Summary of @JossBlandHawtho and @kevinschawinski need to be careful correlating galaxy properties with AGN due to timescales.  #galaxyface16
1	@BenneHolwerda @astroboy_moreno - I think perhaps Omega-Cen - quenched  then eaten by massive galaxy? Qunched.
1	@BenneHolwerda @vrooje Amy Moffat was at both....
1	@jr_pritchard @dunkenj European City of Culture I think.....
1	@azurichard really need to chat with some expert amateurs (which I am not). I just suggest start with Moon and bright planets :)
1	@kevinschawinski like #galmorph last week?
1	@MJIBrown we are very far from done with imaging the local Universe. Clearly! ;)
1	@kevinschawinski so this is basically saying red discs (spirals) are important - right? Just not saying it that way.....?
1	@jr_pritchard  - Scott Croom just applied our advice for encouraging questions at #galaxyface2016 (will now take data to see if any effect!)
-1	@caastro_arc could you pick one asap and tweet on both? @JossBlandHawtho @MJIBrown @kevinschawinski (annoying to follow 2)
1	@kevinschawinski #galaxyface2016 I believe
1	@azurichard also start with bright planets - Jupiter  and Saturn are my favorites. :)
1	@azurichard also try looking at the easy targets first - the Moon is amazing first time through a telescope  and changes through the month.
1	@azurichard recommend you look for a local group of amateur astronomers and/or join online community/subscribe to magazine :)
1	@JossBlandHawtho @caastro_arc @MJIBrown will add some challenges! ;) #galaxyface2016
1	@JossBlandHawtho @caastro_arc requested #galaxyface2016 @MJIBrown :)
1	@MJIBrown #tag ideas for "Changing Faces of Galaxies"?
1	Good one for @startorialist kids section. :)  https://t.co/YBS9PC90Fg
1	@AmelieSaintonge @kevinschawinski @JossBlandHawtho actually I don't think that's great  but can't think of better.
1	@aussiastronomer also to be fair my idea of winter after 8 years in Southern England is not what it was when I lived in Boston! ;)
-1	@aussiastronomer Tasmania though.... in Sept.... looks cold and rainy from the forecast. And leaving from warmest Sept in UK in ~ 100 yrs
1	@jen_gupta not brilliant timing  but it's worth it. :)
1	@astronomyblog @ODIHQ I do get around. Result of that project now discussed here: https://t.co/JyjFDSJ8a0 @LandscapeWatch
1	@robertcnichol thanks - most credit to @astro_hedgehog of course. Hope she is very proud of writing 1st @MaNGASurvey kinematics paper! :)
1	@aussiastronomer absolutely dr. No question.
1	It's @Flightsuit_Tim in the @UoPTechnology office! @astro_timpeake :) https://t.co/RhN3VMESs5
-1	@michaelaye @astro_hedgehog @MaNGASurvey all stars move  but some galaxies are dominated by random motions  not coherent rotation
1	@ICGPortsmouth these ones are from @TikibooFitness (via @SotonAstrodome)  but @startorialist has an entire section of ideas. :)
1	@jen_gupta that was one of my pay offs for managing to get out early on the seafront. :)
1	Managed a @startorialist style run this morning along the seafront. :) https://t.co/EJIHZfi8uA
1	@robertcnichol @chrislintott has proposed jacket linings which would work  but I believe @ShenovaFashion only do dresses/skirts.  :)
1	@startorialist congratulations. I thought as much in Wisconsin! There's a lot of cute baby space fashion. :)
-1	@DocJuniorST @FakeAstropix @PeterDEdmonds also an example of how easy it is to make unthinking mistakes........ #irony
1	@astrotweeps sounds like a plan to me. Fwiw I think you've done great this week. :)
1	@astrotweeps so it's past midnight for you? Sunday morning here. I'm enjoying coffee and news. :)
1	@astrotweeps where are you right now? Surprised to find you tweeting at this hour!
1	@747Captain correct!
1	@AAOastro best wishes for the transition! I remember return to work being rough  but for me so worth it in the end. :)
-1	@oneillleo @astrotweeps will show this poll at the beginning of @PompeyPhysics Computational Physics (plus describe my woeful training!).
1	Many Qs about why Moon can be seen in daytime yesterday. Nice demo of Jupiter and Venus in daytime. @jen_gupta https://t.co/aX1WcrX4tF
1	Love this demo of bending of space time made by @PompeyPhysics student Andy @portsmouthuni #purplespacetime https://t.co/djRqxJ9XvC
1	Great day @VictoriousFest #victoriousfestival talking abt scale and expansion of Universe + gravity w @ICGPortsmouth @jen_gupta @violegp +
-1	@aussiastronomer hang in there. Also write things down. I'd literally be lost if I didn't. ;)
-1	@jen_gupta also "Large" often means very small (it would seem) for women's exercise wear... wonder why. :(
1	@DrDasB @sdssurveys we can help with that too. We have a bunch @ICGPortsmouth - we'll get you one. :)
1	@DrDasB @sdssurveys you can have one if you promise to use it only for EPO.
1	@MJIBrown @SciBry yes. Needs context. :)
-1	@MJIBrown @SciBry I reckon we can find worse if we look a bit. Agree that one is very bad though!
1	@dallascampbell @NASA_Hubble asked son what it was meant to be and he said "cake". Got to love literal 6 yo mind! ;)
1	@david_hurn @jen_gupta stickers better to represent gravitationally bound systems (galaxies and galaxy clusters) which don't expand...
1	@david_hurn @jen_gupta e-foldings will be hard. The stickers fall off if you blow the balloon up too fast! ;)
-1	Every time I see the @TfL Night Tube signs I can't help wishing they were real pictures instead of @FakeAstropix :( https://t.co/gte8beKRn6
1	I will post a (pre-run!) picture if I like them! ;) @startorialist @SotonAstrodome @MinkJessica
1	Thanks for the help on space leggings @SotonAstrodome @MinkJessica @startorialist - went for "intergalactic capris": https://t.co/AY7VYw8pmt
1	@ColemanKrawczyk @coffee_samurai @jen_gupta those are a thing of beauty to behold. :)
1	@nialldeacon @jen_gupta @Jillian_Scudder or have it delivered to my MIL in California as an Xmas present to myself...?! ;)
1	@startorialist awesome thanks! We're having an @ICGPortsmouth team at the Great South Run this year  so I need some appropriate wear! ;)
1	@jen_gupta yes I think VAT is added. I guess i was used to that living in the US - it also happens there (amount depends on state)
1	Hey @startorialist - are you aware of any astronomically themed running gear (thinking leggings)?
1	@jen_gupta it's under £135 so I think it's OK. No Custom Duty: https://t.co/XAUmCdXVa0
1	Love this: Glow-In-The-Dark Constellation Dress @startorialist @jen_gupta  https://t.co/qLQQk8lEcN
1	Fair return - @jen_gupta gives me cakes too! ;) https://t.co/1hL2Jz4Bw9
1	@jen_gupta @JohnChinner ha - yeah unless you bring random members of the public with you! ;) Then maybe! ;)
1	@LibbyJackson__ I always assumed they're the same. US pint different to uk pint though.
1	@jen_gupta I am going to be on a train back soon. Should be there by 3pm.
1	@ProfMike_M nice shot.
-1	@MonicaGrady @haykirstin @OUstudents @OpenUniversity @BBCr4today how irritating.
-1	@helen_hm11 thought we walked past you in the street! Have to take my kids home so can't stay for your talk. :(
1	@jen_gupta thanks I think it was ok  although J said John Milton's was more fun. Kids!
1	3D printed toys from @WinSciFest #wsf16 @techagekids https://t.co/R6afpDdXjV
1	Set up to talk about #toysinspace #wsf16 @WinSciFest @Lottie_dolls https://t.co/BnZlK5QL6Z
1	@jen_gupta @WinSciFest were leaving in 30 mins. Feels wierd to go to Winchester when your in CA!
1	Was amused to see this in #Portsmouth library advertising 1976 astronomy slide lecture by John Mason. @jen_gupta https://t.co/0LUqBP5I5L
1	@Historyheroesuk @WinSciFest @Lottie_dolls not that I'm aware of.
1	About to discuss this news on @BBCr4today Scientists unearth two rocky planets in 'habitable zone' of their star https://t.co/1IWjhnYWYi
1	Still love that #stargazer @Lottie_dolls went to space. I'm talking abt her and other space toys @WinSciFest friday. https://t.co/aJKSmheR8O
1	@kyle_carm @starstryder @mickhyde space has billions of stars  but is also very empty. It's just so big!
1	@mickhyde @ProfMike_M very nice. Thanks for sharing that. So it's not so isolated as it looks at first glance!
1	@mickhyde @ProfMike_M that's another beautiful image. :)
1	@drspacejunk thanks for sharing.
1	@Astro_JohnCF @TrueSciPhi a PhD by definition is original research - e.g cby examining old databases in a new way. As @galaxyzoo showed.
1	The research output @ICGPortsmouth was in the top 10 across the UK for the REF2014 assessment. @portsmouthuni #SeaCityStudy
1	Physics @portsmouthuni has 100% student satisfaction in both 2014 and 2015. #SeaCityStudy
1	We're discussing why to study physics @portsmouthuni - top research + top teaching = why not? #seacitystudy
1	Ill be working today @portsmouthuni open day  welcoming new prospective astro/physicists.  #SeaCityStudy
1	It seems that "@astro_timpeake" is here to great @portsmouthuni open day visitors today! https://t.co/MW0kzIwmlK
1	@MattWest_S4 @jen_gupta gin and tonic with lime. :)
1	Taking advice from @jen_gupta now my observing done for the night. :) https://t.co/1rBRuBy0v4
-1	@PenguinGalaxy I'm fine. Slightly suffering from information overload!
1	@PenguinGalaxy @realscientists @galaxyzoo only this week. It's a rotating account.
1	Just a reminder that this week I'm tweeting from @realscientists at #sdss16.  :)
1	Join me on @realscientists this week for #sdss16 week.  https://t.co/pKTJnlpmO2
1	@adnan_a_malik @realscientists @RealSciMods awesome. Thanks.
1	#stargazer @Lottie_dolls at Yerkes Observatory. https://t.co/VcRB8kIqFB
1	By the way from tomorrow I'll be tweeting as @realscientists for a week. All #sdss16 tweets will go there. :)
1	@dallascampbell :)
1	@dallascampbell @BBCTwo @FryRsquared I'm still catching up  but hope you noticed @guardian mention as best thing on today!
-1	@kevinschawinski thanks. I had tweeted that earlier if you look (and I've told her). Twitter crowd v. concerned to fact check my 9 yo! ;)
1	Nice that @LibbyJackson__ got a mention in of the #schoolsconfences. We're delighted to be hosting one of them @ICGPortsmouth @portsmouthuni
1	@mggtTaylor it's quite interesting to hear the perception of 9 yos on world events. I've also been asked which continent we are joining! ;)
-1	@mggtTaylor @NASA @esa that was her perception though Her friends also worried England has to leave #euro2016 if we don't vote #remain!
1	Now @LibbyJackson__ looking very happy on @BBCNews #congratulations to all at #UKSA #WelcomeHomeTim https://t.co/98cbbhWEF7
1	Son (6) makes his comments on the current @NASATVLive view from space: "Why is it going so slowly? Which planet is that?"  @AmazingSpace2
1	@OmanReagan "voids" is used to describe spaces with few galaxies  and filaments or "the cosmic web" for the rest.
1	@OmanReagan we live in a small collection of galaxies called "The Local Group". We also sometimes refer to the "local Universe".
1	Fun to wake up to tweets about @kevinschawinski #aas228 @galaxyzoo talk. Thanks @chrislintott @vrooje. :)
1	It's @BBCStargazing Sky at Night tonight in which @chrislintott and I explore UV and X-ray images of Whirlpool. :)  https://t.co/XEOVLiijem
1	@kevinschawinski does the age of a tool matter if it functions? Agreed FERENGI could be improved upon however....
1	.@PenguinGalaxy @galaxyzoo @UoPTechnology in a talk - relevent slides attached. https://t.co/vYwr3ob3uT
1	Hey @PenguinGalaxy - I just used you @galaxyzoo Limerick (credited) to explain my research @UoPTechnology! ;)
1	@Lottie_dolls great project. :)
1	This is obvious when you watch  but I'm so glad @astronomyblog is tracking the numbers. Current #limitone not enough https://t.co/qsM6Sczipg
1	@astronomyblog tweet the link?
-1	@megschwamb sorry we didn't have time for more than "hello  goodbye" last week. :(
1	@megschwamb thanks. :)
1	@robertcnichol @sdssurveys @jajohnson51 thanks for the most Bob like congratulations ever! ;)
1	Awesome @Wikipedia page "Galaxies in fiction". One to read properly when I have chance: https://t.co/kKyogqLhFT
1	@davecl42 @jen_gupta @ICGPortsmouth very cool I like the colours. :)
1	@AstroUDP @jen_gupta @coffee_samurai @ColemanKrawczyk thanks. :)
1	The @portsmouthuni version of @MaNGASurvey press release from today: hi-lighting contributions from @ICGPortsmouth https://t.co/6oSvBf6FYg
1	@AstroUDP is the video you just showed available online? I would like to show my colleagues @jen_gupta @coffee_samurai @ColemanKrawczyk
1	Majewski now talking about the @APOGEEsurvey @NASAKepler collaboration to measure ages of stars in Kepler field. #sharingonesky
-1	@chrisenorth but why the implication we should we be scared of physicists or astrophysicists? That's not a great message....
1	It's @ICGPortsmouth Director  David Wands with #5. @portsmouthuni #Charityfootball https://t.co/F7nsePnV1O
1	1-0 to staff already. Hooray! @portsmouthuni #football https://t.co/F1HYMPQ4Hd
1	First visit to @PompeyFC_News Fratton park today for @portsmouthuni Staff vs Students. @ICGPortsmouth represented by HoD  David Wands. :)
1	An inside look at what it's like to be a female STEM major https://t.co/TsNEwlFPel via @usatodaycollege
1	@mpoessel @claudiascosmos @astropixie @zemogle @sarahkendrew @carolune @orbitingfrog happy memories!
1	@NGC3314 @eddedmondson @hannyvanarkel @KHesser @AMWeijmans coffee! Of course not. It's tea....
1	It's the @portsmouthuni @ICGPortsmouth @pintofscience being advertised in #guildhallsquare as I walked thru. https://t.co/SRHLFtZ8EY
1	@eddedmondson @DrMRFrancis with @IamGBT I get one pixel  but a spectrum which resolves the rotation of atomic hydrogen (hopefully)
-1	@eddedmondson @DrMRFrancis  @sdssurveys yes sorry if that was confusing. The @sdssurveys image of a galaxy I'm using @IamGBT to observe.
1	@chris_tibbs @Caltech @SOFIAtelescope that sound amazing!
-1	@kevinschawinski well we did just have several days of clear weather! Catching rare events is tricky though.
1	@maricarjagger @jen_gupta @BritishCrafting currently I'm quite well set for star shaped jewellery!
1	@robertcnichol I'm in London tomorrow too (House of Lords....).
1	University hosts day of talks on EU | UoP News @portsmouthuni  https://t.co/9CUyyhET28
1	@robertcnichol @BBCr4today haha yes does seem quite unlikely. Odds of less than 5000-1 I would have said! ;)
1	@hackenslash1 true - but that's a long time to wait for it to come to us...
1	@robertcnichol thanks. I'm excited about the opportunity. :)
1	@jen_gupta @ProfCathHarper how lovely. :)
1	Tickets now available for the @portsmouthuni @pintofscience events: https://t.co/ieXM1RQpmr with @ICGPortsmouth @LucyNewnham1 and others.
1	@sondy I'm sure you know you're doing the right thing. I know it's not easy.
1	@claranellist however statistics also show it's usually (not always) the Dad who earns more  so usually Mum who gives up work....
-1	@claranellist yeah. Not only is it expensive to put children in childcare  it's assumed it's the Mum who will give up job if it's too much.
1	Interview with Michelle  a Real-Life Rocket Scientist - Shenova @startorialist  https://t.co/dLlwADgNrz
1	@chrisenorth @vrooje @boomerang @todoist thanks for the additional suggestions. I definitely need some thing. I'm never on top of things!
1	@jen_gupta hope it went well.
1	More signs of #spring on the @portsmouthuni campus (near @ICGPortsmouth building). https://t.co/hY6vfhAzKM
1	@jen_gupta not sure my answer would help  but we can chat later....
1	Thought this leaflet from @portsmouthuni student services was great. :) https://t.co/gxZYiPtbC4
1	@astrobellatrix @Independent I was thinking that too!
1	I learned that @astro_timpeake is doing lots of important science for the UK and Europe while onboard #iss @RoyalAstroSoc
1	I also think I learned that quasars are very easy to explain  I just don't know how to do it.... @RoyalAstroSoc
1	Very pleasant day in London @RoyalAstroSoc - now the train home  with snacks a G&amp;T and an episode of @qikipedia courtesy @BBCiPlayer :)
1	Here it is @astro_timpeake "Peake Chic" for #FridayFashion @startorialist https://t.co/DihhB5uRep https://t.co/HiF92TYTjx
1	Apparantly there has been a new thing in the UK called @astro_timpeake "Peake Chic" #FridayFashion @startorialist
1	Kuh: 24 million people in the UK watched @astro_timpeake launch. @RoyalAstroSoc general meeting.
1	Elvis now talking about "Occam's Quasar". I like it @RoyalAstroSoc
1	Now in the @RoyalAstroSoc general meeting  with Martin Elvis talking about quasars. #sciencefriday
1	@PBarmby @chrislintott @e_astronomer to be fair it's hard luck if you aren't near London (not exactly the centre of the country....).
1	Now hearing abt plans to make superset of @ESAHerschel extragalactic surveys  by Peter Hurley (@PhysicsAtSussex) called "HELP". #rasredshift
1	@chrislintott @e_astronomer I know. I hope @galaxyzoo volunteers appreciate that we are working hard on understanding galaxy evolution! ;)
1	Made it to @RoyalAstroSoc just in time for start. Now listening to Richard Ellis explain what we know about high z galaxies. #RASredshift
1	Made it to @RoyalAstroSoc just in time for start. Now listening to Richard Ellis explain what we know about high redshift galaxies.
1	Slightly early start today - London for @RoyalAstroSoc meeting. Cheered up by new coffee shop and new dress. :) https://t.co/GyIO31WFf6
1	@robertcnichol yeah. Interesting isn't it. They claim they may be revealing unknown CMB systematic in the abstract.....
1	@DawnSunrise1 layers. And comfortable water proof shoes. The weather has been very variable lately.
1	@PenguinGalaxy awesome. @LucyNewnham1 @jen_gupta here is a galaxy in the shape of an elephant. ;)
1	@ProfMike_M OK here's the spectrum. Not exactly a thing of beauty (yet - the Sun is up...) but I see no HI there! https://t.co/eiMDs7PLu6
-1	@ProfMike_M yeah I'm cheating as I've looked at the MaNGA emission line map! ;)
1	@ProfMike_M unfortunately 90s of GPS signal in those last 5mins of data  so have to wait a bit longer (looks like a no though...).
1	@ProfMike_M we'll find out in a few minutes! ;) Meanwhile back to helping to cook roast dinner. Think this is #WorkLifeBalance
1	@ProfMike_M @MaNGASurvey yes. HI non-detection as I predicted. :)
1	@jen_gupta yes I suppose it was. Couldn't think of any other way to actually remember to tell you! ;)
1	@jen_gupta love that I didn't even have to ask you to do that. Clearly we're in sync! ;)
1	@jen_gupta @LucyNewnham1 @DrLucyRogers there is actually a galaxy shaped like an elephant. @PenguinGalaxy may know it's name....
-1	@simon_rp84 @TomFeilden actually I did  but I guess I don't remember that. Only gazpacho soup! Sorry.
1	@simon_rp84 @TomFeilden definitely not a white hole. It's a galaxy. Just a slightly strange looking one.
1	Prof Michael Merrifield @ProfMike_M on why staying in the EU would be good for British Science https://t.co/jBME7enRxy via @CivitasEUFacts
1	@bryn00 no  it's being refurbished..they're all in one ginormous open plan office...
1	@KnudJahnke probably
1	@KnudJahnke @seanmcarroll it's very  important to keep your latex clean.
1	@DrDasB You may be right. Let's see how they respond.
1	@bryn00 Evidently a polymath...
1	@GeertHub so am I  as long as it's espresso...
1	@GeertHub it is true the cappuccino is not beard-friendly  but there are other modes of coffee intake. I'm a strictly espresso person.
1	@GeertHub you need a beard... 😉
-1	Neil Turok introduces his Gerald Whitrow lecture @RoyalAstroSoc with the assertion that fundamental physics is in crisis.
1	At @RoyalAstroSoc with @apontzen just starting his Fowler Lecture on Genetically Modified Galaxies.
-1	@mckinneytweets @Barristerblog Presumably if one tweets something one shouldn't that could be contempt of court?
1	@mckinneytweets @Barristerblog I've never been in a courtroom so know nothing of the protocols. Interesting!
1	@Barristerblog @mckinneytweets whom do you ask  the judge?
1	@Barristerblog @mckinneytweets is it allowed to tweet from a courtroom? Presumably so  but I never knew!
1	@MawKernewek but many will want to leave..
1	@laurencepearl @jfcryan I know four more personally  one going at the end of this month.
1	@MawKernewek @mcnally_bucky @Rachael_Swindon yes  but "1 billion" will be called "2 shillings and sixpence".
1	@bryn00 it's nice to eat too!
1	@bryn00 that would have been too obvious!
-1	@e_astronomer perhaps it should be "the lone and level sands stretch Farage's way"?
1	@mattholehouse @DavidAllenGreen @SkyNews they're all over the place. Not a clue what they're doing.
1	@bryn00 Starke Scheite....
1	@bryn00 yes  it's ENO. They do everything in English.
-1	@bryn00 I was going to listen  but it's going to be sung in a horrible language (English)
1	@e_astronomer look at this! https://t.co/u9OgodKXzk
1	@e_astronomer I'm here all week.
1	@e_astronomer I thought you needed at least a tu one to do a PhD?
1	@markmccaughrean @sarahkendrew As it was in the beginning  is now  and forever shall be....
1	@markmccaughrean @sarahkendrew Surely Trump should be Last? The Last Trump. Geddit? #IllGetMyCoat
1	@GrumpyScientist I might do a post on this but I'm going to be external for the first author's PhD  so will probably wait until that's done!
1	@GrumpyScientist I can't see it from home...
-1	@e_astronomer they're rubbish unless they have me on the panel.
1	@bryn00 Now that I didn't know!
1	@bryn00 Max told me about his son some time ago; Mark used to play for Essex but has moved to Leicestershire.
1	@barryjbutler @MawKernewek Quite. And I think we're a pariah state already.
1	@markmccaughrean thanks for letting me know!
1	@markmccaughrean is anyone doing stuff with the quasars?
1	@GeertHub They already took over. Didn’t you know?
-1	@gaeleksi sadly  I haven't had any wine. I think that was the problem.
-1	@e_astronomer @TheOKC indeed. Sadly  I think there'll be quite a few more such departures over the next months...
1	@bryn00 next door to Valentino's..
1	@bryn00 The Flute and Trumpet was until recently The Promised Land..
-1	@sarahkendrew @stsci @jegpeek no teaching? How dull!
1	@GeertHub it would attract more interest if it were in Comic Sans..
1	.@scorrice When Bach is on I listen to Bach. No space in my head for anything else.
1	@bryn00 I meant the forward version  which I thought stilted and passionless.
1	@andrewpconnell @Jonesthesteam72 what about those who derive the benefit and then emigrate? Or those who get rich without going to Uni?
1	@andrewpconnell @Jonesthesteam72 my view is that it benefits public and individual  so both should contribute.
-1	@andrewpconnell @Jonesthesteam72 but you pay tax whether you went to university or not..
1	@Jonesthesteam72 @andrewpconnell but once at university fee regime was fixed. All those who started on 3k continued at that level.
1	@e_astronomer I've never been to Thanet. It's nice to have fulfilled one ambition.
1	@bryn00 so Mahler had three songs disallowed. Were they offside?
1	@bryn00 so Mahler won 5-4 in extra time.
1	@willbonds @StigAbell @WSJ cf people who put Professor or Prof in their Twitter handle..
-1	@willbonds @StigAbell @WSJ I think insisting on being called "Professor" is a sign of insecurity rather than vanity..
1	@e_astronomer @Stan_And_Ollie from the same  brilliant  movie https://t.co/3fiMYFfDa0
1	@dstndstn @rdrimmel not sure which field exactly but YES
1	@dstndstn @rdrimmel G photometric uncertainty vs G! It's large when source is variable. Working near LMC permits classification. Or color!
-1	@GeertHub @owlice @dstndstn @kellecruz fuck yeah!!
1	@brendonbrewer p(d|x)=N(d|x σ); p(x)~x^(-4) in x&gt;a; sample x|d σ very very fast. Need 1024 samples each for 2.5 million cases of d σ
1	@shaka_lulu maybe rich people are just more likely to work to increase disparity by locking up their IP in a patent
-1	@jbocha @jradavenport yes! Use #gaiaSprint and we can arrange for telecom. The point is to get shit done  so pretty much any working counts!
1	@physicsmatt you can slide them around arbitrarily
1	@physicsmatt I think you mean a vector field. In #nyuphysics1 vectors don't have a location. They ONLY have a magnitude and a direction
1	@lukebarnesastro @wordpressdotcom where's @StealthMountain ? #pedantry
-1	@adrianprw @rdrimmel whoops! Deleting my wrong tweet!
1	@hubbahubble I couldn't agree more
1	@biphenyl gorgeous!
1	@jegpeek hey  there are only 26^5 FLAs.
1	@jegpeek thank you!
1	@jegpeek yes  yes I do! Correcting...
-1	@sarahkendrew @dstndstn @michelle_lmc @astrofrog I say the only way we can change things is to openly share our shitty  wrong code! #RSE16

-1	@MJIBrown @OmanReagan ...substantial focal plane distortions...
1	@GeertHub @mrtommyb @elsisrad will you come crash #AstroHackWeek ?
1	@naivebayesian @TeslaMotors whoops!
1	@Astro_Wright @Robotbeat molecular and solid state processes have effective temperatures way higher than 300K for purposes of Carnot
1	@Robotbeat and ps. Flares could help
-1	@Robotbeat @chrislintott @SCTrager (a) haven't calc'd; just sayin' (b) fact that PVs work in the IR isn't sufficient (c) no doom implied!
1	@rdrimmel No! But the usable free energy drops very quickly with the temperature of the host star. Of course the flares could help!
-1	@brendonbrewer I was reluctant to tweet that! The Carnot cycle? Does that ring a bell?
1	@adrianprw @caprastro @shaka_lulu I was trying to remember what they are called!
1	@caprastro @shaka_lulu that ensures that the LSST data can't be used to investigate #contrails!
1	@cloud149 @brendonbrewer me too!
1	@chgreer @brendonbrewer I plan to go down before the ship
1	@brendonbrewer you MONSTER valuing your health over the ENVIRONMENT!  But no seriously  lots of reasons to climb stairs! And 2017 :(
-1	@brendonbrewer I think that actually more than doubles the marginal difference bc food and transport of food.
-1	@shaka_lulu you will be missed. @_inundata  you will be drunk.
1	@GeertHub @GoojajiGreg that is awesome! Does that mean that a larger chunk would  say  wipe out Berlin?
1	@GoojajiGreg pea sounds too small. Calling @GeertHub
1	@GeertHub woah  what project is that? And who wrote the software?
-1	@kellecruz @shaka_lulu @jakevdp @github fuck yeah!
1	@emeegray @astronomyblog @guardian @AlanYuhas so much awesome in deep ocean science!
1	@exoplaneteer @Wikisteff @meg_bedell @TimothyDMorton @AgolEric excellent point. @NASAKepler did a great job of search.
1	@Wikisteff @exoplaneteer @meg_bedell @TimothyDMorton @AgolEric this is a good idea; are we sure @NASAKepler got everything @ &lt;400d ?

1	@adrianprw @megschwamb @NASAKepler @dstndstn I think you mean @mynameisfiber
1	@physicsmatt theorist!
1	@physicsmatt another great feature!
1	@hubbahubble @exoplaneteer I know!!
1	@physicsmatt Just had a thought: it would be SO COOL if past-Rome was on the lightcone. A periodic Universe would be the best thing EVER.
-1	@physicsmatt actually  Rome 3000 yr ago isn't on the light cone  so-strictly speaking-doesn't have a redshift!
1	@physicsmatt did you mean "was"? I think most Romans are either Catholic or atheist these days!
1	@aussiastronomer cool!!
1	@MikeHudsonAstro @jbprime @cooperUCI @astroboy_moreno Confiscating the colon: Improvements in astrophysics paper titling from 2000 to 2015

1	@MBKplus @cooperUCI @jbprime @astroboy_moreno I just don't know if UT takes contributions to titling and latex-formatting seriously enough
1	@jbprime @cooperUCI @astroboy_moreno the masters of great paper titling live at UCI

1	@AstroGinaB @chrislintott @GeertHub Awwwww!
1	@GeertHub @AstroGinaB @chrislintott Nawwwww!
1	@jegpeek @NASAWFIRST Yes  absolutely. We have been bullshitting for years  but we have good datasets to run a real test.
1	@merrdiff @SimonsFdn @Wikipedia @astrobites ping me and I will RT it
1	I'd love to hear more stories from the @SimonsFdn-sponsored  @Wikipedia edit-a-thon at #aas228 https://t.co/K1PGW9AfSX
1	@chrislintott @AstroGinaB @GeertHub he does a fucking great impersonation
1	@AndyChrisCRPC @jbocha bloodbath! For me  anyway
1	@GeertHub @aussiastronomer @KeplerBot yes!
1	@jbocha who do you like after Exaggerator? As you could predict  I like Cherry Wine...
1	@GeertHub @aussiastronomer bot idea: tweet one @NASAKepler variable-star lightcurve per day  with classification
1	@aussiastronomer @NASAKepler these are great! What kind of variable was (2)??
-1	@aussiastronomer alien megastructures!  🙂
1	@brendonbrewer I hope that's true!
-1	@bochowns @jbocha @UNUsays @hope_reese @TechRepublic indeed. Exaggerator will go off at 1:2!
1	@jbocha @bochowns @UNUsays @hope_reese @TechRepublic those were short odds bets among exotics. The parimutuel odds are also crowdsourced!
1	@jbocha @bochowns @UNUsays @hope_reese @TechRepublic isn't it a no-brainer?
-1	@jegpeek @asymmetricinfo because the less powerful who broke those rules are incarcerated for life
1	@naivebayesian I'd love to but it will take me a lifetime to get words on paper. I do intend it!
1	@aussiastronomer You are right! But I used to blog each day at the end of that day; I am trying to get back there...
1	@merrdiff ps you can definitely play! We are working here https://t.co/EMAC9qeN6X (mainly issues  some code) and will keep you in loop
-1	belated research post: computational science  @NASAKepler microlensing events  radial velocities  etc https://t.co/6Iu2KtFQ1b
1	@merrdiff we will try to deliver these! Will let you know
1	@davidwhogg cc @NASAKepler @GeertHub
1	@merrdiff I think we (read: @adrianprw and @melissakness) may know how to do this; we aren't afraid of double-lined binaries!
1	@merrdiff your awesome @NASAKepler EB KIC 9246715 is in @APOGEEsurvey public data; is there information about the system you want to know?
-1	@jegpeek @astrowizicist @MIT that ... and the fact that I CAN'T BE FIRED.
1	@R_Trotta It's @ixkael's world; I'm just a squirrel trying to get a nut! And thanks!
-1	@astronomyblog but of course! We underscore the fuck out of things cc @dstndstn
1	@jbocha I only had 2 bets: something on Exaggerator to win and the balance of my account on him to show. Way above-average horse day
-1	@jbocha Exaggerator!! Did you have money on him?
1	@KyleCranmer @openscience yes  you are absolutely right there
1	@KyleCranmer @openscience I only see it as a cost because you have to think about it  and maybe talk to a lawyer
-1	@GeertHub that is  quite literally  the most boring site on the internet
1	@McMillan_Astro @nfmartin1980 @GeertHub @jegpeek @mrcbqn @jradavenport @rdrimmel @hubbahubble is that policy published somewhere?
1	cc @nfmartin1980 @GeertHub @jegpeek @mrcbqn @jradavenport @rdrimmel @hubbahubble #ttrttpt
1	@nfmartin1980 @GeertHub @jegpeek @mrcbqn @jradavenport @rdrimmel @hubbahubble also Gaia only releases final data products; not reproducible
-1	@partialobs @rdrimmel @hubbahubble if possible to re-do searches in full data stream  this is a policy change and I withdraw my criticism!
1	@jegpeek @jradavenport @rdrimmel @hubbahubble @MAST_News this is great! I take it back re panstarrs
1	@rdrimmel @hubbahubble the list is known: panstarrs  LIGO  LHC/Atlas  you name it!!
-1	@rdrimmel @hubbahubble we were talking in general  but real q is: assassinate or wait?!
1	@cloud149 @jegpeek why you are reading this as being about physics? These are all-NSF priorities; most sciences weren't mentioned at all
-1	@jegpeek @willowdower @astronomolly my only point is that a DOI without versioning is worse than useless
-1	@jegpeek @willowdower and that would be bad if we interfaced with @GitHub programmatically; we do with mast: https://t.co/jBSRAOj9uK
-1	@willowdower @jegpeek also  interface changes interfere with development
1	@jegpeek @willowdower not a reason not to make them accessible! #reproducibility
-1	@willowdower @jegpeek critical requirement: content and interface need to be clearly versioned. Not currently the case. #researchparasite
-1	@jegpeek @sdssurveys this is just a tiny bit embarrassing!

1	@brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer awesome! But Paywall! Can you send me a PDF?
1	@lukedones @kellecruz @alexteachey thanks -- useful!
1	@hubbahubble @kellecruz @alexteachey typical single-system limit at each L-point is a few M_earth? Sounds right. How much does Jupiter have?
1	@hubbahubble @kellecruz @alexteachey Highly relevant! You don't have a PDF of the poster any more?
1	@lukedones @kellecruz @alexteachey Awesome! I mean the former... But if there are limits on the latter  I'm impressed!
-1	@duetosymmetry @jegpeek @astronomeara @kellecruz @alexteachey Good point. Do tidal distortions of hot Jupiter (or star) kill Trojan orbits?
-1	@jegpeek @astronomeara @kellecruz @alexteachey I think the problem is scale free  isn't it? Isn't the only problem *other* massive planets?
1	@astronomeara thank you; relevant!
1	@brendonbrewer hey I know that bar! AKL
1	@astronomyblog you should label the strongest diagonals with names!

1	@brendonbrewer @Cosmic_Horizons though I don't disagree  it would be fun to see a concordance between an important paper and a good rewrite
1	@jbocha @bochowns @DRFInsidePost @Fox_Hill_Farm that changes thing! Get well  Songbird
1	@brendonbrewer @dstndstn Better to start with @drphilmarshall or @mdschneider who are making probabilistic weak lensing pipelines.
1	@brendonbrewer @dstndstn yes  if you marginalize out psf  sky gradient  and flat-field uncertainties and fit the higher resolution scene
1	@jegpeek @GeertHub or  I get all my mosaics at Mosaic King!

1	What you do after two hard days of exoplanet science with @albertoconti and NG Next https://t.co/WlLJGUbTaZ
1	@albertoconti Apparently its only previous use is "Nice Guys Shouldn't Finish Last" back in 2013
1	@albertoconti what's the hashtag? #ngSfL?
1	@shaka_lulu @dstndstn I remember the first half of that party well
1	@dstndstn @shaka_lulu ps I often find myself chanting pointer dereference details to stay in the zone while rushing to the bathroom
1	@dstndstn @shaka_lulu I would be honored to go out like Brahe! That said  you CAN dash to the bathroom and not lose the debugging thread.
1	@GeertHub @exoplaneteer Don't get used to it -- I had no internet all weekend!
1	@astrocrash @jbprime thanks for the refs. Another @twitter astrophysics win from my perspective!
-1	@astrocrash @jbprime I know it's crazy but what if the DM is 30 Msun BHs. Ruled out by Bondi L? Or no detect bc high velocity  low density?
1	@jbprime It's pretty different to be illuminated by an accretion flow than a 5700K star! But great movie treatment
-1	@brendonbrewer @Cosmic_Horizons @exoplaneteer we don't claim any particular result is wrong. We only claim that correctness is hard
1	@aussiastronomer @NASAspitzer @exoplaneteer @bschoelkopf don't even know-scikit learn defaults probably
1	@aussiastronomer @NASAspitzer what ICA method are you using? Words anywhere? @exoplaneteer @bschoelkopf and I have been playing with ICA+K2
1	@timmermansr @ESAGaia what's the story behind the framed flag in the background?
1	@michelle_lmc Woah  blown away by this hardware solution that can handle multiple tweets at once!
-1	@brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer did you look at the __main__ block?
1	@brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer no need to figure. There's a callable prior function and a callable likelihood function!
-1	@brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer you need to give an error bar too
1	@brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer who needs a pgm? We deliver a likelihood function and a prior pdf.
1	@brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer It is not *quite* ready for prime time but https://t.co/qTIEAtYzGy ; ready within days; you'll be the first
1	@brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer yes but it's big; how do you want it?
1	@brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer or maybe insert an "expressed as"
1	@brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer pdf is a weighted sum of other pdfs  maybe?

1	@naivebayesian @climatecorp @twitter oh yeah!
-1	@briandavidearp @brendonbrewer @QuilletteM I disagree! #openscience
1	@brendonbrewer @QuilletteM @briandavidearp science is supposed to be an open discussion  not executed by innuendo
1	@brendonbrewer @QuilletteM @briandavidearp that article would be a lot more compelling with a real-name example
1	@aussiastronomer All we are waiting for is a @LIGO data-release policy! cc @AstroKatie
1	@gully_ @jegpeek no their fact sheet says something in the 20s
1	@pkgw only if you don't consider a radio dipole array to be a telescope.  I do!
1	@rdrimmel looking at that now.
-1	@rdrimmel she sounds dreadful and wrong

1	@dalcantonJD @NGC3314 @HIgalaxies I didn't say that!
1	@NGC3314 @dalcantonJD @HIgalaxies she is pretty specific in her papers about the model she wants to build
1	@NGC3314 @dalcantonJD @HIgalaxies yes those are all good things
1	@dalcantonJD @NGC3314 @HIgalaxies Hey I wrote papers on these things too! But I feel like we didn't achieve what Tinsley expected
1	@dalcantonJD @NGC3314 @HIgalaxies Things we believe about galaxies not that different from 1990. Cosmology totally transformed. Bits per $
1	@NGC3314 @HIgalaxies I think that's true  and I am the hugest Tinsley fan  but didn't that turn out to be a step backwards in the end?
1	@rdrimmel seriously! Hope to announce something soon
1	@Wikipedia I don't think you would get consensus from philosophers that it doesn't exist!
1	@biphenyl Oooh. https://t.co/tqD6dbGgpq: Figure out the hardware used to take an astronomical image based on calibration properties.

1	@brendonbrewer don't remember; he was talking about the fact that you can do exact simulations of a quantum system using a quantum computer
1	@brendonbrewer Feynman wrote some things about that
1	@brendonbrewer just testing how deep your determinism runs!
1	@brendonbrewer If you are objecting to the causal question  then I agree. Now what about: Is global warming caused by human activities?

1	@AgolEric @hubbahubble @exoplaneteer @DrunkEricFord would love to see it
1	@betanalpha @brendonbrewer must be talking about diff't things: Bishop ch9 says EM locally optimizes the marg. likelihood  and proves it too
1	@betanalpha @brendonbrewer But EM and local optimization answer the same question. That's all I am asking.
1	@brendonbrewer I guess "unknown" is sufficient

1	@adrianprw register again and email @megschwamb
-1	@renaudflo @michelle_lmc you are in danger of infinite regress: maybe science is what happens after the thing you are calling science!

1	@brendonbrewer awesome; will analyze!
1	@renaudflo @michelle_lmc nice!! Paper?
1	@GeertHub @mrtommyb you might ask @156542Hogg directly; or ask @GeertsToaster
1	@brendonbrewer @iamdavecampbell absolutely!
1	@megschwamb @merrdiff thanks!
1	@merrdiff good question. @megschwamb ? Is there a viewable doc?

1	@hubbahubble @AstroDressing what's the hashtag @exoplaneteer
1	@ProfMike_M I have often said the same! But of course there's the whole "dollars weigh less in space" thing
1	@exoplaneteer can you point @brendonbrewer at the mixtures-of-gaussians-in-fourier-space GP paper?
1	@brendonbrewer this is a decade-length project  not a year-length project.
1	@brendonbrewer oh and ps you have to run on 70 000 data points fast
-1	@brendonbrewer Yes  it is to make the spectrum model from a stellar model; this requires MANY nuisance parameters  it turns out.
1	@jbocha your picks by email were good; I hope you cashed. My only hit was an insurance exacta. @AndyChrisCRPC

1	@brendonbrewer @ruthangus definitely useful! We have a few more experiments to do but then let's get together to chat (by phone)
1	@GeertHub @exoplaneteer probably not in 140 characters! Lots about inference  sampling  noise  and model-space search; also code+tests+users
1	@cosmos4u my point wasn't specifically about any culture
1	@cosmos4u I mean that we do (and ought to) try not to build buildings inside the view of natural wonders  even though many would love to.
-1	@brendonbrewer exactly my point: I am the lazy  you are the non-lazy!!
1	@brendonbrewer once again  the #lazyweb works for me! Thanks so much.

1	Hey @planethunters and exoplaneteers: Is there a paper somewhere with a catalog of single transits (ie  P &gt; 4 yr) in @NASAKepler data?
1	@Astro_Wright YES they are hella coherent.  Typical G star and giant modes are unresolved in 4.1 yrs of @NASAKepler observing

1	@hubbahubble Oooooooooo.
1	@nhuntwalker @caseycourval @niais Yeah  time/effort is a limited resource. But  my experience is that often no one even starts the work...
1	@caseycourval @niais @nhuntwalker though  there's often some underlying issue with the disengaged kids as well  just undiagnosed...
1	@niais @nhuntwalker In comparison to systems with much deeper  but narrower minima  where works great only when perfectly implemented.
-1	@niais @nhuntwalker So  I think many suboptimal choices schools make are the ones with broad local minima. So  if not perfect  still not bad
1	@niais @nhuntwalker It takes so much sustained support to get lessons from small studies effectively rolled out to entire schools.
-1	@niais @nhuntwalker And in practice  teachers usually don't. (For many reasons that are not "teachers bad")
1	@niais @nhuntwalker I have seen studies confirming this  BUT  outcome depends -strongly- on getting clusters right.

1	@NGC3314 @BenneHolwerda @PBarmby Oh noooooooooo!
-1	@ProfMike_M @e_astronomer You seek your own downfall or Andy's?
-1	@astronomeara We're all so silly. Stoopid brains.
1	@e_astronomer Ha! Luckily  I am in a department of terrific collaborative people  so this particular worry has never entered my mind!
1	@lcjohnso @nhuntwalker I don't know! Seems like the best theory so far...
1	@nhuntwalker A madman who likes to count.
1	@shaka_lulu @aussiastronomer I WILL BE COUNTING YOUR DONUTS  Walkowicz.
-1	@aussiastronomer @shaka_lulu "These are an inadequate number of donuts! Rescind her PhD!l
-1	@shaka_lulu @aussiastronomer @PlanetDr I'm fretting needlessly about a non-essential craigslist ad. Because that's how civilizations fall.
-1	@aussiastronomer @shaka_lulu But that's too rational  so let's FREAK OUT!!!!
1	@aussiastronomer @shaka_lulu And you know what  even if you did forget something? It'll -still- be ok! It's amazing.
-1	@shaka_lulu It's so ridiculous. I would never treat anyone else the way I treat myself sometimes.
1	@shaka_lulu True. But the circle of Things I May Have F'ed up expanded dramatically.
1	@mcnees And truly  there is little that's rational about it. I know my brain quirks well enough to have anticipated that this would happen.
1	@mcnees Nah  past chair was a good guy. There's just a lot of balls in the air.
1	@PlanetDr 👍
-1	@PlanetDr I recognize that it's totally irrational  but the stupid brain wants what it wants....
-1	@PlanetDr But I can never give myself credit for that. Especially not at 3 in the morning. MUST FOCUS ON PERSONAL FAILINGS!!!
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor @demitrimuna 1k avg. Would love a sliding scale based on user base. 1k is huge for state colleges...
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor @demitrimuna Cash stream for central support  in-kind donations for maintenance.
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor @demitrimuna Which is why the "multiple paths to subscribing" could work.
1	@brettmor @nhuntwalker @demitrimuna But maybe can merge with subscription model. You can pay cash  or support local.
1	@brettmor @nhuntwalker @demitrimuna Good way for students to skill- and resume-build while keeping a foot in both worlds...
1	@brettmor @demitrimuna That definitely has a 2 birds with one stone appeal. Lots of back end costs on grads (tuition  benefits).
1	@brettmor @demitrimuna Probably better model is "so cheap people don't think twice" and drastically expand pool. 300 groups with 1K.
1	@brettmor @demitrimuna But 10k/yr is a lot. That's why depts were more than happy to let IDL costs lapse.
-1	@brettmor @demitrimuna It's probably $150k/yr incl benefits  min. So  2 people is $300k/yr burn rate. 30 donors of 10k would do it.
1	@brettmor @demitrimuna None of this is insurmountable  though.
-1	@brettmor @demitrimuna I had to jump through crazy hoops to get cloud computing budgeted before it was more widespread.
-1	@brettmor @demitrimuna Meaning  there are huge structural obstacles with new types of costs. "Buying software" is a known category.
1	@brettmor @demitrimuna It's a possibility. Prob depends on # of digits and whether it can be structured to look "budgetarily recognizable"
1	@ktcherny @jegpeek @adrianprw @authorea That is some mighty fine viz  Kirill!
1	@_sarahmartell_ &lt;extra happy to be member of CAASTRO-3D&gt;
1	@mcnees No ejecting your right eye.
1	@mcnees   &lt;J. Crew Headquarters&gt;  "Oh sh!t. How are we going to break this to @mcnees?"
-1	@niais @startorialist I would be more worried about jealousy.
1	@niais Loved this one too! https://t.co/0akkUznryR @startorialist
1	@astrotweeps Woah!
1	@ethan_kruse @hubbahubble That title and abstract pretty much covers it  really.
1	I'm thinking one of my colleagues needs to write a paper titled "Hey Look  Exoplanets!" https://t.co/gMJGlNy8D4 @hubbahubble
1	@rareflwr41 @astrotweeps I wuv her.
1	@Alex_Parker @lukedones @niais Amazingly  we ran into a "Pigeon Assassin".  https://t.co/jdkUvsAmB8
1	@rareflwr41 @astrotweeps Does she flinch if something is wrong? That would be awesome  to have a grammar support dog. She could wear a vest.
1	@shaka_lulu @lukedones Wait. Whut????
1	@mcnees Holiday shopping? Handled.
1	@kejames @Summer_Ash Absolute. Team logo by @Alex_Parker IIRC.
1	@NovaSilisko @PlanetDr @EllenStofan @ltelkins HAHAHAHAHA
1	@PlanetDr @EllenStofan @ltelkins See? YOU'RE the best.
-1	@PlanetDr @EllenStofan @ltelkins When I got married  our caterer forbid sangria. "Trust me. Everyone just winds up puking in the bathroom."
1	@PlanetDr @EllenStofan @ltelkins Oh my!
1	@lukedones Weather is pretty nice. Does that mean @Alex_Parker is out of town?
1	@nhuntwalker Such a good article.
-1	@merrdiff They are truly horrifying  being both large and fast.
1	@mcnees The numbering is all in red  so pretty sure given the tech at the time that those markings are hers.
1	@mcnees Pretty sure original...
1	@nhuntwalker Right? It's such great science  and the gold is getting buried!
1	@lukedones You should grab a spot on my schedule!
1	@BenneHolwerda @astronomolly HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA.
1	@vrooje @PenguinGalaxy For the moment  slides are online. Stephen Heard's book on Scientific Writing is also great. https://t.co/9Nv3josojA
1	@hubbahubble Oh my!!!! Talk about talent along many dimensions!!!
1	@nbatalha @hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare ...publicly thanked the UW president (the awesome Ana Mari Cauce) for UW's copious tampon dispensers.
1	@nbatalha @hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare In a lunch of female STEM profs yesterday  a friend (returning from long visit to UCB)....(1/2)
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare @POPSUGARBeauty Oh good gravy.
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare "For a limited time  the McSugarCube"
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare I think there's a whole untapped marketing opportunity here.
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare That's adorable.
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare Toss in little half-n-half containers and kids will imprint like baby birds.
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare My dad was a grad student when I was little  and  40+ yrs out  I remember going to the office because SUGAR CUBES
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare Ha! They always wanted to come in because of Pat Taylor's M&amp;M stash.
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare The only prospie convos I remember well are with a TOTAL BOOGER at Stanford and my future advisor.
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare WHY ARE U SO BOOFUL AND GOOD  SARAH?
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare &lt;sniff&gt;
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare I'm glad it was useful rather than veering into "horribly inappropriate overshare".
-1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare Every trip is sponsored by a parter who doesn't make me feel like crap for wanting to do my job.
1	@hubbahubble @DrsSarahCare I think about it all the time too. I am grateful every damn day.
1	@hubbahubble We recite it chapter and verse.
1	@hubbahubble @BlkGrlMgc @TheBanneker This picture is the best.
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor @kgarofali I was 16 and inexperienced  but even I knew that was bullsht.
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor @kgarofali My partner called all arrays things like "RA"  "ra"  "array"  "Ra". (2/2)
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor @kgarofali I worked on character recognition in a high school summer program. (1/2)
1	@hubbahubble @niais @PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI @JedidahIslerPhD @astroprofhoff ...you don't know or aren't listening to black and brown people.
-1	@hubbahubble @niais @PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI @JedidahIslerPhD @astroprofhoff I think if you aren't aware of a crisis....
1	@hubbahubble @niais @PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI @JedidahIslerPhD @astroprofhoff I was reading the statement  and was "oh  that's not awfu......"
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor @jradavenport @codefellows Done!
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor Exactly.
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor Maybe I'll just have Brett stand around showing off his knuckle tats.
-1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor Part of me wants a 6'x8' poster for my office  but I think swear words on the wall are probably not a Good Choice.
1	@brettmor @nhuntwalker Please tell me there's a T-Shirt.
-1	@DrMRFrancis @mcnees I've been gobsmacked at how all the CERN results are plotted. Same default  but it's AWFUL.
1	@NGC3314 Chucked 'em!
1	@Thomas_Connor @mcnees I can recognize at least 4 different theses in there...
1	@Thomas_Connor @mcnees So  I just kept layering.
-1	@Thomas_Connor @mcnees My youngest spent an hour plus drawing Halloween stuff  and I never could bring myself to erase it.
1	@Thomas_Connor @mcnees You mean this white board? https://t.co/06f9qUzW2M
1	@kejames @serenawilliams I like how the tennis court reflection looks like she's shooting lazer beams from her eyes.
1	@e_astronomer I think its origins are Pennsylvania Dutch. You pour batter through a funnel into hot oil to make a lacy fried thing.
1	@shaka_lulu @MillerAdamA So  what are we to do? I DO NOT HAVE A 5 DIMENSIONAL PRINTER
1	@kejames @CoopSciScoop Might be ideal to have different "modes"  like in Fruit Ninja. #CitSciChat
1	@mcnees It's not self-promotion as much as laying out the conceptual edifice.
1	@mcnees Also  frequently one's work is part of a coherent intellectual path  where Paper D legitimately depends on Papers A  B  &amp; C.
1	@lukedones @jaynebirkby #IwantmyHDST
1	@nhuntwalker @astronomolly Given how you came out  that's a pretty good starting model!
1	@nhuntwalker @astronomolly I'm not saying which ones  but the number of these issues I *know* what I'd do because I had to do it...hoooboy
1	@ethan_kruse @nhuntwalker This will change.
-1	@jradavenport @nhuntwalker And new grad curriculum is *much* leaner as well  with lots of real meat pushed into "electives". I fret a bit.
1	@jakevdp @nhuntwalker This is adorable.
-1	@nhuntwalker This is why I lean pro-qual. All that "this detracts from my research" talk? Nawl. It is ENABLING your future research  ideally
-1	@nhuntwalker Dust? SUPER BORING. #havewrittentwobigpapersondust
1	@nhuntwalker Kindof....everything?  Never did spectroscopy  never learned much about stars  never even REMOTELY considered planets.
1	@nhuntwalker Well  not everyone has your amazing capacity for self-study coupled with wide-ranging interests!
1	@nhuntwalker Alllllll of this  Nick.
1	@michelle_lmc @eteq @bigticketdw Worth their accepting it for the gifs alone!!!!!
1	@michelle_lmc @eteq @bigticketdw Yaaaay!!!! At Lorentz?
1	Nice result from IFU decomposition from @ProfMike_M - S0 bulges are systematically younger and more metal-rich than their disks #discs2016
1	@astronomeara Too slow with the camera.
-1	@nhuntwalker Empirically  mainstream white America shows very little history of being swayed by empathy for black people's suffering.
-1	@nhuntwalker Like  "this isn't my experience  so you're paranoid"  as opposed to assuming that rational people are responding to f'd up ish.
-1	@nhuntwalker Sadly  no. I think what mainstream white America tends to do is assume it's an issue with black America's skewed perception.
-1	@nhuntwalker @caseycourval Regardless of nomenclature  it's profoundly f'ed up and wrong.
-1	@nhuntwalker @caseycourval Yeah  well said. It's two fold  I guess. Fear is rational  but long term effects of fear compound &amp; complexify.
1	@nhuntwalker @caseycourval I just think it's best described as a completely rational assessment of risk.
1	@nhuntwalker Except  it's not paranoia if someone is actually out to get you...
1	@shaka_lulu I wouldn't even go to a party there.
1	@nhuntwalker Who knows! It was just a LITTLE fire.
1	.@mcnees Me: "Once upon a time  there were two little girls."  5 year old: "And they were eaten by wolves."  Me: "...."
1	.@mcnees One of my favorite moments with my kids: Long car trip. Kids were maybe 2 and 5ish. Playing "add a line to a story".
1	@nhuntwalker @howgilb When your "good old days" were racist as f@ck.
1	@BenneHolwerda I wish  but no. But  3 PHAT bricks worth  all w/ high SFR intensity (cc @mrcbqn)
1	@mcnees @Wendy_Mc I think you just need to take Cheeks out here for a vacation.
1	@mcnees @Wendy_Mc Seattle's science center has GOBs of them.
1	@nhuntwalker Hell  best father period. (Which makes his being a black single parent all the more profound.)
1	@IBJIYONGI @AlexandraSurcel @niais @mcnees It's hard when you're biased by things like  I dunno  facts.
1	@IBJIYONGI @niais @mcnees &lt;nods&gt;. I get having the first reaction of wishing it weren't true. But then  you have to own up.
-1	@mcnees @IBJIYONGI @niais Yeah  I think that's maybe hitting the root of why I tend to keep my distance from some performances of allyship.
-1	@IBJIYONGI @niais @mcnees It's why no one thinks they're a rapist.
-1	@IBJIYONGI @niais @mcnees Owning up to one's mistakes can start to shatter the whole structure of our self image.
1	@IBJIYONGI @niais @mcnees But it's a brittle definition if you can't accept that being a "good person" sometimes means facing up to mistakes
1	@IBJIYONGI @niais @mcnees We all have a lot invested in seeing ourselves as "good people".
1	@nhuntwalker @ZachWeiner Having well cared for future adults &amp; keeping skilled labor in the workforce are benefits society should invest in
1	@nhuntwalker @ZachWeiner The obvious solution no one will enact is that child care should be subsidized.
1	@nhuntwalker @ZachWeiner It also keeps going to the right  because of finding solutions during the summer!
1	@EricHaywood @nhuntwalker Genius.
1	@nhuntwalker @vrooje @niais @IBJIYONGI Also  It wasn't actually lupus.
-1	@nhuntwalker @vrooje @niais @IBJIYONGI During Mystery Illness  doc suggested a lupus screen &amp; I avoided shouting "IT'S NOT LUPUS!"
1	@nhuntwalker It's the Nick-JD Mutual Appreciation Society! #myselfiegameisthepits https://t.co/D87L8Xcg37
1	@lukedones Yay?
1	@mcnees @lukedones Yeah  "Looks of Desire" for baby kangaroo snuggling is pretty much a "dog bites man" headline.
1	@lukedones Well  I  for one  have a strong desire to snuggle a baby kangaroo.
1	@nhuntwalker @jradavenport Good point.
1	@nhuntwalker @jradavenport I'm really curious how different that map of Japanese households looked after WWII internment.
1	@nhuntwalker @jradavenport Hellooooo 1930's....
-1	@nhuntwalker @jradavenport Did you see these visualizations? Years of (racist) policy and history mapped out....
-1	@BenneHolwerda @dstndstn @davidwhogg No good deed goes unpunished  Volume Infinity.
1	@nhuntwalker @UWgomap Good to know for the future!
1	@nhuntwalker Do you think this would have been a good option while being a grad student as well?
1	@nhuntwalker Community is the BEST.
1	@kellecruz @alyssaharad @astrokatey @michael_w_busch "Gas lighting" is from a movie. Is there one that would work here?
-1	@kellecruz @alyssaharad @astrokatey @michael_w_busch "emotionally manipulative"? But  not quite right and not catchy.
1	@niais @Summer_Ash @nhuntwalker I still like "Magic".
-1	@nhuntwalker @Summer_Ash My mom was having that problem regularly and the doctor told her "eat dried apricots" and it went away....
1	@BenneHolwerda @niais Didn't know! That's great!!!
1	@nhuntwalker @niais @McIntyreKmci That said  I do agree that there was strong foreshadowing of a path that didn't get taken in Force Awakens
1	@nhuntwalker @niais @McIntyreKmci It's the old "just because you CAN  doesn't mean you have to".
1	@mcnees @orzelc Like THEY'D not wake YOU up if they wanted something? Fair  F'ing play  Cheeks. Go get papa some ice cream.
-1	@niais @IBJIYONGI @hubbahubble The superb @knottyyarn wrote a lot about the challenge of being black in Seattle when she was leaving.
1	@hubbahubble There's probably something around being hot and having their motions locked  but I don't think I'm ready to go there...
1	@NGC3314 @TSHamiltonAstro @kevinschawinski @BenneHolwerda That's a pretty one!!!!
1	@_sarahmartell_ @niais @AstroKatie I just kept getting bigger and bigger  and class was 90 minutes long. The mind wanders  I suppose.
1	@niais @_sarahmartell_ @AstroKatie There's a reason these aren't revealed until after the quarter. That said  I was largely amused.
1	@niais @_sarahmartell_ @AstroKatie "I spent the quarter trying to figure out if she was pregnant or not".
-1	@niais @_sarahmartell_ @AstroKatie One of my fave student feedback comments  under "what detracted from your learning" was (1/2)
1	@astronomolly @jegpeek Is it my imagination or is this particularly pervasive in the ISM community?
1	@IBJIYONGI @hubbahubble Celebratory Twitter is always my favorite Twitter.
1	@amyekimball Boo HISSSSS!!!!!
1	@bradpholden @jegpeek @astronomeara True. But we will need a lot more than one telescope for follow-up spectroscopy  for sure.
1	@astronomeara @jegpeek @bradpholden Does the proposed CFHT survey instrument match the requirements (except for being non-US)?
1	@mcnees I  would prefer just to take it!
1	@mcnees I would be -super- into this class.
-1	@nhuntwalker @CodeFellowsSEA Nobody ever balances right on the knife edge. I'll always take "a bit too driven" over "not much ambition".
1	@nhuntwalker @750words @CodeFellowsSEA Aw! That's great!
1	@AsteroidEnergy First three papers here: https://t.co/qbSjHeYgtt
1	@BlkGrlMgc @eilatg @adiamondstanic @jbprime @astroprofhoff I scan for core physics  highest level math taken  bonus point for CS exposure.
1	@BlkGrlMgc @eilatg @adiamondstanic @jbprime @astroprofhoff Agreed. Achieving a "major" secondary to "what classes did you take".
1	@nhuntwalker I am a fan. May be jet lagged so happy hourish?
1	@InvaderXan @BenneHolwerda You can do both -- it's just the slides may be a bit brief which can be good (quick study) or bad (too terse).
1	@InvaderXan @BenneHolwerda I skimmed this new book  and it hits many similar themes. https://t.co/A1ziKoBlu4
1	@InvaderXan @BenneHolwerda I'm fine with limited personal use. Might get a bit irked if someone lifted them wholesale for teachng w/o notice
1	@BenneHolwerda https://t.co/0EmP5GFbbB -- Only the links from the first three weeks are live.
-1	@Lynne73 @amyekimball Yeah  it's an on-going challenge.
1	@amyekimball @Lynne73 I take unleashed dogs seriously.
-1	@amyekimball @Lynne73 Traumatic brain injury. She's the rear admiral of a tandem  and was launched when the front of the bike was attacked.
1	@Lynne73 @amyekimball I'm guessing unleashed dogs. Which is why my bike-riding mom has a TBI.
-1	@nhuntwalker That's excellent. "focusing on everything is the same thing as focusing on nothing." #guilty
1	@carylgronwall @MBKplus @astronomolly @rachelosten I guess we can be thankful for the 1K proposal making the rest of us look cheap.
1	@astronomolly @rachelosten There was a multicycle call  which liberated people to think beyond a few hundred orbits.
1	@sondy The details on their costumes were *amazing*.
1	@astraughnomer @NASAGoddard Congrats!!!!!!!
1	@sondy Hard core!
1	@nhuntwalker Gotta get together so I can give it to you and hear about the new gig!
1	@sondy Ha! Did it take ENDLESS PAPER MÂCHÉ for you as well???
1	@sondy @dstndstn @YourPaperSucks High five!
1	@astronomeara Tumlinson style!
1	@taylored4astro @laurawatkins_ @BenneHolwerda @jegpeek I'm grateful for thorough edits. It means they found what needs fixing.
1	@rareflwr41 @BenneHolwerda @laurawatkins_ That's a drag  when good ideas sag under the weight of not-quite-good-enough instruction.
1	@BenneHolwerda @jegpeek @laurawatkins_ Editing feels like trying to pull them apart....
1	@rareflwr41 @BenneHolwerda @laurawatkins_ There was a "Grad Skills" class? That's a good concept!  But I could see how execution is tricky.
1	@BenneHolwerda @jegpeek @laurawatkins_ Would that it were so simple  Benne.
1	@BenneHolwerda @laurawatkins_ Yup. For the first half of the course (at least)  the class is 1/3 writing process  1/3 guidelines  1/3 edits.
-1	@mcnees @hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI @niais Sorry  I'll leave you adults to have your adult conversation. &lt;goes back to writing proposals&gt;
1	@mcnees @hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI @niais DEPLOY THE INTERGALACTIC SWIFFER!!!!!!!!
1	@NGC3314 @eblur27 We kept on safeing HST by trying to look at GR8.  Very x-files.
1	@NGC3314 Swift had a CD with a theme song.
1	@mcnees @AstroKatie @brianwolven "Poor ratio of bounce to the ounce."
-1	@mcnees @AstroKatie @brianwolven "Despite their efforts  the authors failed to get jiggy with it."
-1	@mcnees @AstroKatie @brianwolven "Insufficiently jiggy" would be the best/worst proposal review commentary.
1	@mcnees @AstroKatie @brianwolven New bio?
1	@kittykaraoke @AstroKatie @brianwolven @mcnees Your gif game is strong tonight  Sean.
1	@nhuntwalker @Summer_Ash See  that sounds judgey.  I wouldn't want that.
1	@Summer_Ash @nhuntwalker Is 750 words about getting back in the writing zone which will help science writing or is it more self-reflection?
1	@InvaderXan @instagram I get their trying to optimize the default  but please let others opt out!
-1	@mcnees Mine was how a discussion of the literature was entirely dissing the haters.
-1	@SCIPLUS @astrokatey I'm just sad "she-devils" was already taken.
-1	@darth "I WILL KILL YOU WIF MY TEEFS!!!!" https://t.co/mp0zVBfrk4 https://t.co/XK5mGiwXki

1	@darth Or Scrooge McDuck. Whatever.
1	@darth But truly  I guffawed.
1	@RobbLoeb @startorialist @darth Custom sized from https://t.co/5TKocuHMiQ  for hard to fit dogs!
1	@darth She is the dog version of Duck McScrooge  squashing the proletariat.
1	@darth Is this a dog who deserves nice things like a Pikachu hat? NO IT IS NOT. https://t.co/4aSbL1chwI
1	@darth FYI  PJs are from https://t.co/5TKocuHMiQ
1	@darth The other pup is Elfie  Destroyer of Worlds.  She gets nothing.
1	@KnudJahnke I don't understand what you're saying. Google translate isn't helping.
1	Ok internet. My dog now has turtleneck space pajamas. @startorialist https://t.co/Zgb8E80TfL
-1	@jradavenport @StartsWithABang @PeterYoachim @niais Woah -- didn't realize you actually missed it!
1	@BenneHolwerda @jradavenport oooooo SNAP! (and 100% correct)
1	@nhuntwalker They were both fantastic in Season 2!
1	@nhuntwalker !!!!!!!!!!!! Yay  you.
1	@astronomeara DOOOOOOOOO IT!!!
1	@PeterYoachim I was using Toodledo for a while. I think @nhuntwalker also has one he really likes.
1	@jbprime @AstroKatie @JossBlandHawtho @planet4589 I had an early microlensing limit that held for a long while: https://t.co/NA7H3ayfwE
1	@BenneHolwerda @astronomolly Do we have a HST proposal tag yet?
-1	@emilylurice @jegpeek I've always been stunned that people let that one go without a major ruckus.
1	@j_bellovary @nhuntwalker Heh heh heh heh.
1	@nhuntwalker Looking forward to hearing about the new gig when things settle down!
1	@nhuntwalker You can mail a caucus form in  but you had to do it by the 18th...
1	@nhuntwalker We have a great vote-by-mail system. Why can't we just use that?
-1	@nhuntwalker You have to work then? Can't caucus. Kids are sick? Can't caucus. Don't speak english? Damn hard to caucus.
1	@nhuntwalker Good for participatory democracy  but bad  because caucuses are a ridiculously privileged way to decide something important.
1	@lukedones @paparatti Oh Seattle.
-1	@lukedones @IBJIYONGI The weeks that the h-bar closes are sad  desperate times in PAB.
1	@IBJIYONGI @eteq   &lt;LMC sees SMC about to crash into Milky Way&gt;  LMC: "I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE!!!"
1	@DudeDarkmatter @PeterDEdmonds @JossBlandHawtho There were strong hints from lensing rates that path lengths were longer than expected.
-1	@shaka_lulu Yeah  it's been bugging the crap out of me.
1	@astrokiwi @eteq @abigailStev @jradavenport YESSSSS!
1	@eteq @astrokiwi @abigailStev @jradavenport So  you can do the equivalent of sequential builds like you'd use in talks.
1	@eteq @astrokiwi @abigailStev @jradavenport Ppl who only look at the figures are also unlikely to spend the time to decipher multiple axes.
-1	@eteq @astrokiwi @abigailStev @jradavenport One solution is to make 2 plots instead of one. Page charges aren't -that- expensive  people.
1	@nhuntwalker Bring it on  Universe!
1	@brettmor @GeertHub @astropy @eteq Writing a python version of IRAF's "splot".
1	@kejames @Lexialex I love how it also points home the cruelty of "to make it through  make yourself more like me"= cut off parts of yourself
1	@nhuntwalker Or...binge the new season of Daredevil that just came out?
1	@nhuntwalker That thing where you make a bunch of outdoor plans in the first 15 minutes you're up  then....nevermind.
1	@mcnees That's right up there with "This statement is a lie".
1	@mcnees My daughter  who knows NOTHING about basketball  is ahead in her pool by 20 points.

1	@nhuntwalker In an environment that cultivates an illusion of a perfect oasis of learning  so of course nothing is wrong.
1	@jbprime @niais @emilylurice But it's ok. He really had no obligation to interact with local kids. He was doing his part in other ways.
1	@lukedones Author related to Helen Bonham-Carter? How many Bohnam-Carters can there be?
1	@robertcnichol Everyone should have a hobby.
1	@StartsWithABang @niais @sadydoyle Well  if he was your Kirk  I don't wanna take that from you.
1	@StartsWithABang @niais @sadydoyle Riker did not have charisma. He thought he had charisma  but no one really liked him.
1	@nhuntwalker I'm liking this one. https://t.co/t79FVagcRt
1	@nhuntwalker Nick  I commit to getting Dr. Hunt-Walker a tophat and sword.
1	@katemath @kejames @Alex_Parker &lt;spittake&gt;
1	@Alex_Parker @kejames It's like 90 minutes of hand-crafted artisan Spotify.
1	@kejames @niais @astronomolly It took me a while to figure it out.
1	@kejames @niais @astronomolly In high school a sweet guy confessed his affection by giving me a #TweetYourMixtape of Triumph love songs.
1	@kejames @niais @astronomolly There probably needs to be a #TweetYourMixtape hashtag.
1	@mcnees @Summer_Ash Maybe she needs a blessing from Cheeks.
1	@astronomeara @jegpeek @fuckeveryword Has someone done a ranked list?
1	@astronomeara @jegpeek @fuckeveryword I've been fascinated with why some combinations get more likes and retweets than others.
-1	@nhuntwalker Shoot!
1	@dstndstn @albertoconti @adrianprw @GeertHub @jegpeek SDSS definitely centralized a major layer of analysis.
1	@amyekimball No such luck. It's like you just stand there  but move.
1	@nhuntwalker Did you ever run into "Blogging the Bible"? https://t.co/4JoEFF2YHe

1	@jegpeek @dstndstn I got one of their necklaces as a birthday present  because my husband is awesome.
-1	@mcnees @Disney And maybe the movie is about getting her AND the lightsaver she found back to the rebel alliance.
-1	@mcnees @Disney Until the climactic fight scene where she gets it right right before she kills the bad guy. (2/2)
1	@mcnees @Disney That could be the running gag. She mispronounces it differently every time (1/2)
1	@mcnees @Disney I think they befriend a little girl and work together to bring her to safety.  The little girl would have adorable cheeks.
1	@startorialist @Summer_Ash @slowfactory_ I WILL KEEP ALL APPENDAGES CROSSED IN HOPES OF ANDROMEDA PHATWEAR!
1	@michelle_lmc @surreyastro That little dome is adorable.
1	@lukedones My daughter's elementary school music teacher taught them to sing "Boris the Spider" and "Magic Bus".
1	@katerice22 @Discovery You might want to check out https://t.co/jQFaRhkltP -- there are lots of astronomy projects that could use your help!
1	@SCTrager @albertoconti I was more about "Its really fun to take hits of O2 and have my heart slow to less than 120 bpm"! Also  daytime.
-1	@SCTrager @albertoconti Every time I went off supplemental oxygen it was a disaster.
1	@SCTrager @albertoconti Thanks Scott! Though that look of determination is me muttering "Don't pass out. Don't pass out " at 14 000 ft.
-1	@hubbahubble Sorry I missed you!
1	@hubbahubble You in town? &lt;waves&gt;
1	@Summer_Ash @startorialist My husband surprised me with a piece for my birthday and it's gorgeous. It's foldable &amp; light so great for travel
1	@Summer_Ash Have you seen the 3D printed stuff from n.e.r.v.o.u.s system? It's not officially @startorialist but it's geeky and gorgeous.
1	@niais @nhuntwalker @UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @Summer_Ash Yelling  but in a supportive way.
1	@nhuntwalker @UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @niais @Summer_Ash I guess for me it's about freeing myself from decisions.
1	@nhuntwalker @UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @niais @Summer_Ash "Why haven't you made that plot? I TOLD YOU TO MAKE THAT PLOT!"
1	@nhuntwalker @UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @niais @Summer_Ash I want something more like the tough sergeant from boot camp.
1	@UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash I've got this in spades. I really need a buddy system.
-1	@UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash ...but will disappoint yourself over and over and over again.
-1	@UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash Yeah  that thing where you'll do anything to avoid disappointing others...
1	@UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash But it won't come if you're not actually doing it.
1	@UrbanAstroNYC @astroprofhoff @nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash This is so true. You never know when your best stuff is going to come.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash @astroprofhoff That is genius and deep.
-1	@nhuntwalker @hubbahubble It's one bonus of kids -- they really enforce downtime.
1	@nhuntwalker It's so messed up.
1	@nhuntwalker I think @hubbahubble had some good lifehacking rewards built into her system.
1	@nhuntwalker I should talk to you about what you're using!
-1	@nhuntwalker Hell yeah. I don't know why so many of us are incredibly mean to ourselves  in ways we'd never treat other people.
1	@nhuntwalker So  key is the classic "breaking down tasks into smaller ones"  &amp; then letting yourself say "Good enough! Good job!" when done.
-1	@nhuntwalker It's setting oneself up for failure  frustration  and despair.
1	@nhuntwalker And that means you're *never* going to get the needed moments of satisfaction on a daily/weekly basis.
1	@nhuntwalker The key is that we often give ourselves impossibly huge scopes. Such as "I need to finish my thesis".
1	@nhuntwalker I saw this great "inspirational poster" (eyeroll) about the power of "done". Something being "done" is mentally liberating.
1	@lukedones @TheAVClub Not so sure about that.... https://t.co/VKMPzOTjUC
1	@merrdiff @LSST @UW For realsies? That's great!!!!!
1	@PlanetDr But more importantly  YOUR ADORABLE FLOOFY DOG IS CHIRPING IN A NYT ARTICLE!!!! This IS a great day for science.
1	@reneehlozek @hubbahubble Bingo!
1	@nhuntwalker I looooved Evil Cisco!
1	@hubbahubble If you time your boarding right  you can sit next to the pilot!
1	@nhuntwalker Ok  I'm on the east coast  and  um  YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE FLASH!!!!!
1	@nhuntwalker @niais Candidates then spend all their effort honing a very limited message.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais Yeah  but that would largely amount to "NE picks the dem nominee and SE picks the republican".
1	@nhuntwalker @niais I'd be happy with a system that did 4 states at a time -- one NE  one SE  one Midwest  one west coast in each round.
-1	@nhuntwalker @niais (Though I worry that if it were national  all that would matter is "who has the most $$ to buy ads")
1	@nhuntwalker @niais Because the fate of the nation would not rest on the opinions of Real Americans in Iowa and NH?
1	@mcnees @BruceRauner They are clearly doing good work nurturing a student population with great potential.
1	.@mcnees @BruceRauner Our department's graduate school applicant pool regularly features terrific candidates from Chicago State.
1	@shaka_lulu @vrooje @jradavenport There's also a bias that creeps in that favors a "performance" of this kind of intelligence.
-1	@shaka_lulu @jradavenport So  desensitizing the emotional response so you can grapple with questions can really help.
-1	@shaka_lulu @jradavenport Also  a lot of questioning that feels "aggressive" is not actually personal  rather than "probing the science".
1	@shaka_lulu @jradavenport I wonder if there is a useful way to simulate the process  to develop the habit in a realistic-but-safe situation.
-1	@shaka_lulu @jradavenport So we should do some more aggressive hazing to better prepare you for the outside world?
1	@Jos_de_Bruijne @ScienceChannel @Arianespace @arianespaceceo The telescope will actually fold in thirds to fit! It's pretty amazing.

-1	@astrokatey That too. But really  what would be the point if you didn't have AGB star mass loss to look at?
-1	@mcnees I am squirming as I hold back tweeting every goddamn line from the movie.
-1	@jegpeek I'm ok when it's labeled  and there's just a few. Instead  it'll be a sparse timeline going back an hour but missing lots.

1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor @jradavenport @delurieous To thine own self be true.
1	@davidwhogg @NGC3314 @HIgalaxies So  we know pretty much the same things as before the launch of HST? Really  David?
1	@davidwhogg @NGC3314 @HIgalaxies Step backwards for what? Understanding of galaxies certainly benefited.
1	@NGC3314 @SARA_Obs That's almost an Orion doppleganger.
1	@InvaderXan Maybe adding "Be kind to self" would cover it? Sometimes I notice that I would *never* treat others the way I treat myself.
1	@InvaderXan I love this plan. But I'd add "forgiveness of self" for the days that Operation: You Deserve Better takes a needed day off...
1	@NGC3314 "overlapping self-adhesive linear occulters"
1	@BenneHolwerda @AAS_Publishing @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim @chrislintott My concept was that those PPT links could link to diff figs.
-1	@niais @Summer_Ash @PlanetDr I hate crying on planes.

1	@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim @chrislintott @AAS_Publishing Would save a ton of community effort hacking plots to readability.
1	@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim @chrislintott @AAS_Publishing Could do a modified one for "presentation version".
1	@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim @chrislintott @AAS_Publishing Some med journals let you click on figures to get pptx slide.
1	@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim @chrislintott @AAS_Publishing Also liked the idea of a switch for presentation version.
1	@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @PeterYoachim Isn't @chrislintott involved in @AAS_Publishing as well?
1	@amyekimball ENCHILADAS FOR LIFE!
1	@PlanetDr (No matter how awesome planets are)
1	@PlanetDr And it's not like astronomy's record on minority training and hiring is anything to feel superior about.
1	@PlanetDr Yeah  but they want to be coders.
-1	@astronomolly @PlanetDr And skinny  as in "an excess of skin that spreads and creates an illusion of fatcattedness".
1	@astronomolly @PlanetDr I love a fat flattened cat.

1	@astro_jje @docfreeride @DrMRFrancis I'm a fan of talking it out with someone. Articulating why it's hard usually helps me find the fix.
-1	@gsnarayan @astronomolly Unless SNO's big ball of heavy water fell on you. That would be bad.
1	@astronomolly @gsnarayan Neutrino astrophysicists are actually underground astronomers.
-1	@NGC3314 There are a bunch of papers arguing forms of this  so you are not alone!
1	@BenneHolwerda @jegpeek @nfmartin1980 @astronomolly @NASAWFIRST Some combination of continuous + sparse coverage is frequently useful...
1	@BenneHolwerda @jegpeek @nfmartin1980 @astronomolly @NASAWFIRST There's nothing that says that *can't* wind up being the camera layout.
1	@JellySock @albertoconti @DeepAstronomy @ProfSaraSeager Me too!
1	@Lynne73 @BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts The biking infrastructure is also gradually getting better  w/ more separated bikeways.
-1	@davidwhogg @astronomeara @exoplaneteer I'm baffled. What does this gain you?
-1	@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts I've been in too many bike accidents and near misses to be complacent.
-1	@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts ...but then stick your kids in heavy  ill-behaved traffic with nothing but a bit of foam on their heads?
1	@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts If you are scrupulous about seatbelts and cars with the best safety features...
-1	@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts I do it  but I have serious qualms about taking kids in traffic here.
-1	@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts It's not just the hills. Biking in Seattle is not safe.
1	@BenneHolwerda @niais @drannawatts There is a "Dutch Bike" store in Seattle  so there's a local market.
1	@PeterYoachim @mcnees HAHAHAHAHAHA
1	@NGC3314 No. I'm saving that for my 50's.
1	@amyekimball Right?!?! But 15 yr olds are awesome so it makes it ok.
-1	@shaka_lulu @jonathansick Oh hell yeah. They have an octopus rug. https://t.co/p6ffSs08Xe
1	@NGC3314 @keckobservatory If there are dates in the header  you can probably figure out who was observing...
1	@BenneHolwerda @ebellm @jradavenport Yeah  postdoc advising is usually pretty random. More places (UW included) need to do better.
1	@mcnees Sometimes  they wear icing.
-1	@nhuntwalker "I failed because this situation was one that would never play to my strengths" is *way* more emotionally neutral &amp; useful.
-1	@nhuntwalker Probably helps with imposter syndrome too  by moving away from a generic "I failed because I'm not good enough".
1	@nhuntwalker It's so good to break this down. It's like "Oh. That's why that situation wasn't working for me."
-1	@KnudJahnke That said  many of the stories in #astroSH involve fear for actual physical safety that take it to a different level.
-1	@KnudJahnke Agreed that bullying is a huge problem too. Discussing #astroSH doesn't mean other harassment isn't important to deal with.

1	@amyekimball I MADE THE CUT!!!!!!
1	@amyekimball I actually wind up referring to these sometimes when I teach...
1	@docfreeride @orzelc @reneehlozek And by choosing to employ you  I am sending a message about my own values.
-1	@docfreeride @orzelc @reneehlozek It's not worth the real risk that you'll slip again.
-1	@docfreeride @orzelc @reneehlozek Agreed. Most of this stuff  I don't care how bad you feel about what you did.
1	@astronomeara @astronomolly Who'd you take it with?
1	@astronomeara @astronomolly Whooooo boy. That'll be a....growthful experience.
1	@astronomolly @astronomeara The O'Meara diagram of rates of production of Peeples-Dalcanton diagrams....
1	@orzelc @reneehlozek A lot of that would and should be private  however  making external judgements of real reform harder.
1	@orzelc @reneehlozek ...people who were genuinely capable of reforming might actually reform  and stop.
1	@orzelc @reneehlozek If institutions found out about the smaller stuff before it became bigger stuff  and actually intervened ...
1	@orzelc @reneehlozek I think assessment might be easier if there were more ways to intervene earlier.
1	@mcnees @orzelc But we all tell these stories to ourselves as well. No one likes to think they're a Bad Person.
1	@orzelc @reneehlozek That's a pretty low bar.
1	@astraughnomer Please. You're totally covering up that NASA is building a Space Accordion.
-1	@PlanetDr My dogs are merely dorktastic.
1	@PlanetDr That *is* a booplefloof!
1	@e_astronomer @Meg_Urry (The old "one" vs "you" pitfall...)
-1	@e_astronomer @Meg_Urry Whoops! Did not mean it as such -- I was aiming for "neutral factual statement" rather than admonishment!
1	@e_astronomer @Meg_Urry If your actions show that you can be trusted to be a force for good  you'll probably start hearing more.
1	@e_astronomer @Meg_Urry It's typical to bury this stuff because they have no faith or trust that it will be dealt with.
-1	@e_astronomer @Meg_Urry I would strongly doubt it's a US-only problem.
1	@docfreeride @ct_la Seconded.
-1	@ct_la @docfreeride The endless battle between holding people accountable vs putting stuff behind you for sanity....
1	@ct_la @docfreeride Well  it's *better*  but still flawed. I'm sorry it didn't get better fast enough for your path to be different.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais I use emacs so it would have to be my right pinky.
1	@niais @nhuntwalker My eldest does. She loves both kids and money. Youngest can do "mother's helper" gigs.
-1	@nhuntwalker @PeterYoachim @niais It's often a harder problem when your kids are school age.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais I would have given a pinky to have family in the same city.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais Oh yeah. We didn't live close  but would (and could afford to) fly family in when I had work travel.
1	@PeterYoachim @nhuntwalker @niais &lt;shudder&gt;summers&lt;/shudders&gt;
1	@nhuntwalker @niais Always a good time to get married  but never a good time to plan and pay for a wedding...
1	@nhuntwalker @niais But  if you're in an entry-level position that can go somewhere you want to go  then keeping to at least part time helps
1	@nhuntwalker @niais If you're in a holding pattern job  then yeah  definitely stop slinging espresso and save the money.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais Childcare can be an investment in your future earning power  for certain career paths.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais Definitely  but it's short and long term $'s too. We're more secure now because neither of our careers stalled
1	@nhuntwalker @niais I remember my mom pointing out that there was never going to be a "good time" -- "Hmm  my next 18 years? totally clear."
-1	@nhuntwalker @niais This convo makes it sound impossible and awful  but I still have no regrets about having kids. #weird
1	@nhuntwalker @niais Your day is abbreviated  but you can often get a second shift in after kids go to sleep. Provided they sleep.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais There's a reason my students and colleagues would always get email from me at midnight.
-1	@nhuntwalker @niais And yeah  the day to day scheduling stuff is crazy. Both my and my husband's jobs are flexible  and it's still tough.
-1	@nhuntwalker @niais Yup. Definitely not trying to imply that it's cheap!  Every time a kid enters kindergarten  it's like getting a raise.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais But costs at infant level are way more expensive than at preschool age  so even 1 year off can save a ton.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais It's basically college tuition level expenses without 18 years of previous saving.
1	@archillect @VealSlab I think it might be ESO's VISTA telescope: https://t.co/nwhqpHlnT9
1	@albertoconti @blakebullock @JasonKalirai @ProfSaraSeager @matt_mountain That's a terrific picture of everyone!
-1	@nhuntwalker I *still* have a problem with it  even now that I really can buy my own damn food.
1	@astrofairy @RoyalAstroSoc @apontzen Congrats  Andrew!
1	@_sarahmartell_ @niais @mcnees Right? Someone on a playground once opined that with parenting "the years are short but the days are long".
1	@Thomas_Connor @niais @mcnees Not to mention anything about our relative velocities.
1	@niais @mcnees My eldest kid just turned 15 today  so she's closer to 25 than I am.
1	@mcnees The map for "one" looks uniform. It gets more un-uniform up to six and then smooths out again.
1	@mcnees And the mountain west never says never. https://t.co/kunK3539v0
1	@mcnees Why the regional bias against certain numbers? https://t.co/LpXIHhB65c
1	@mcnees Could be boob-related  maybe?

1	@mcnees @niais Only in Alaska are you free enough to live that dream.
1	@niais @mcnees Like *you* weren't also searching for gerbils. Come on  Sarah.
1	@mcnees Alaska's pulling its weight though.
1	@mcnees I got a lot of mileage out of searching for various internal organs. Spleen. Pancreas. Liver. Bladder.

1	@mcnees https://t.co/A8u15UDelo
1	@mcnees Why do some places care so much about the pancreas?
-1	@mcnees So that I can tell you how much time I wasted entering random words into the twitter mapping search you sent around?
-1	@bradpholden @nhuntwalker A girlfriend of mine took up piano because she realized her kids never saw their parents struggling.
-1	@bradpholden @nhuntwalker But they're often really happy to see more senior people struggle the same struggle.
1	@_sarahmartell_ @nhuntwalker Twitter: Come for the cute animal pictures  stay for the accidental community mentoring.
1	@Cosmic_Horizons @darth_ben @nhuntwalker @DudeDarkmatter @astronomolly @jradavenport Except me. I just seem to persist at being old.
1	@Alex_Parker @nhuntwalker Tod speaks highly of it.
1	@astronomolly @jradavenport @nhuntwalker The ascii shrug works.
1	@jradavenport @astronomolly @nhuntwalker "and then I headdesked."
1	@astronomolly @nhuntwalker I -finally- shot it down though. Which is better than publishing something exciting but TOTALLY WRONG.
1	@astronomolly @nhuntwalker I'd always suspected that "interesting feature" was an artifact but it kept standing up to every test.
-1	@astronomolly @nhuntwalker I wasted my sabbatical writing a 95 page paper that I finally figured out was wrong.
1	@nhuntwalker You may currently suck at algorithms but you're doing good on the "life coaching" bit!
1	@nhuntwalker Yup. And If you don't start with your baby steps  you never run.
1	@nhuntwalker I need this framed in my office or in a needlepoint pillow.
-1	@nhuntwalker I think these fears contribute to why a lot of mid career folks drift more into admin and astro-management.
1	@nhuntwalker Plus  you start to wonder if you're even still smart enough.  Maybe my best work IS behind me.
-1	@nhuntwalker But  I'm so overcommitted I wonder if I even have the time needed to invest in the necessary growth. Which sucks.
1	@nhuntwalker And  it's time for me to stretch in new directions.
1	@nhuntwalker I'm currently facing this from a mid career perspective. I've spent a significant frac of a decade thinking about a few things.
1	@nhuntwalker Actually a feature of most research careers.
-1	@nhuntwalker Yeah  it hurts to throw yourself at your ignorance when you've gotten comfortable with mastery elsewhere.
1	@nhuntwalker &lt;thumbs up!&gt;
-1	@nhuntwalker Growth mindset  Nick! "I suck at algorithms RIGHT NOW."
1	@megschwamb That's a great term. Sad  but great.
1	@jonathansick @ruthangus @jradavenport @GeertHub @libcce @eteq @shaka_lulu @chrislintott @adrianprw @davidwhogg Hacking= The new afterparty?
1	@jradavenport @jegpeek Seconded. I'm going to be teaching a "writing for grad students" class in the spring and was hoping to cover this!
-1	@Alex_Parker @astronomolly @startorialist Though now I'm wanting a 4 pieces set of different regions  because GREEDY!!!!!
1	@Alex_Parker @astronomolly @startorialist Yay!
-1	@Alex_Parker @astronomolly @startorialist Which I say because your usual MO is to fix problems as soon as mentioned....
-1	@Alex_Parker @astronomolly @startorialist Though sadly  they're melamine and not ceramic....
1	@Alex_Parker @astronomolly @startorialist Ha! And have a banquet service.
1	@PlanetDr @aomawa @startorialist @astronomolly Yup! That's why I only have a picture of the display rather than ALL OF THEM.

1	@michelle_lmc No. Not at all.
1	@InvaderXan Question for @corbett?
1	@niais @carylgronwall Another question: Do we need 2 meetings a year? @AAS_Office #aas227
1	@nhuntwalker @magnus99k I def sympathize with the motivation. But it's notable in being about the only thing that he maybe didn't get right!
-1	@nhuntwalker @magnus99k I'm pro Joe West but telling Iris her mom was dead was a dick move.
1	@mcnees I get this.
1	@astronomolly @astronomeara There should be a "photos with PHAT" hashtag.
1	@astronomeara That's very nice  but I refuse to answer a courtesy telephone at the Gaylord.
1	@emilylurice @astronomeara @astronomolly It's hard to tell but I'm thinking those are animatronics?
1	@astronomeara @astronomolly I'm remotely fascinated by this venue while at the same time having no desire to ever  ever experience it.
1	@shaka_lulu @RubixsQube Where winter may or not be coming  depending on your model atmosphere.
1	@Summer_Ash @shaka_lulu NYC. He's based in Seattle  but I think travels.
1	@Summer_Ash @shaka_lulu You might want to see if this guy is planning to pass through. Amazing work. https://t.co/dHU8VyoMTu
-1	@mcnees Your sleep was astronomically insignificant though.
-1	@jbprime Which is the only galaxy in this fight with a REAL bulge? That's right. Andromeda.
-1	@jbprime Andromeda is ready to sick M32 on Milky Way's ass.
1	@jbprime Milky Way's mouth is writing checks it can't cash.
1	@LonelyProbe That's fine. Everyone is allowed to enjoy art as they choose.
1	@astronomolly @robminchin @jegpeek This seems to be a theme. I think you're spending too much time out of town!!!
1	@astronomolly @BenneHolwerda I hope there will still be some in February!
1	@nhuntwalker @jradavenport @niais For real. Seattle needs waaaaaay more low income housing  embedded EVERYWHERE.
-1	@nhuntwalker @niais ...but then reacting poorly when their cultural norms are not instantly embraced by the  existing culture.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais (i.e. Embracing sending their kids to public schools where white kids aren't the dominant culture....
-1	@nhuntwalker @niais Lots of mistakes made for all the predictable reasons  at the same time that people are doing lots of the "right" things
-1	@nhuntwalker @niais Eager beaver white parents bringing money and gung-ho-ness to public schools that historically served black students.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais I'll have to dig it up but there were some really interesting Times pieces about schools negotiating changes.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais I'd totally look at the neighborhoods in east/south Seattle that are light rail accessible.
-1	@niais @nhuntwalker My eldest fled the local school for high school because she was (rightfully) sick of it.
1	@niais @nhuntwalker It's pretty uniform. And since they changed how school assignment is done  the schools are resegregating fast.
-1	@niais @nhuntwalker Right where I am  it's not so bad  because I'm not zoned single family. But  all the SF zoned stuff north of the canal?
1	@niais @nhuntwalker (grammar is hard)
1	@niais @nhuntwalker Which explains why so much of why my 5 mile radius is pretty damn white.
1	@niais @nhuntwalker But  I later found out that that choice put me in Seattle's historically redlined areas.
1	@niais @nhuntwalker Bridges = significant commute time.
-1	@niais @nhuntwalker We were in the same boat (knew my job but not his). Chose to look only where I wouldn't have to cross a bridge.
1	@niais @nhuntwalker Happy to skype over this if you want.
1	@astronomeara @nhuntwalker @brettmor I thought about getting them to cater one of the PHAT team meetings.
1	@astronomeara @nhuntwalker @brettmor When you have a collaborative visit with Jess  we will make Tropicos Breeze happen. Full bar too.
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor Also  you can park at the Oaktree  buy tix for a movie  get your drink on at TB  then sober up at the cinema.
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor The baliadas are my fave.
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor And really  Tropicos Breeze is freakin' perfect. Pupusas  tamales  green booths  and continual Univision.
1	@astronomolly @BenneHolwerda @xayma @te_pickering Yeah  while the Kindle has that functionality  it's definitely not as easy.
1	@BenneHolwerda @xayma @astronomolly @te_pickering I first switched for travel weight  but my vision is going and now I love font adjustment.
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor Also  it's right around the corner from Tropicos Breeze  which has excellent cheap Central American food.
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor There's also a pretty big one right to the Oaktree cinema on Aurora. More parking.
1	@VealSlab Right???
1	@megschwamb @lukedones And @caprastro.
1	@mcnees @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI @Mad_Science_Guy But guess what? Funding cuts! No money to allow us to offer it again.
1	@mcnees @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI @Mad_Science_Guy Those students had real world credentials when applying for jobs.
1	@mcnees @UrbanAstroNYC @IBJIYONGI @Mad_Science_Guy UW used to offer evening 101 class that was often taught by grad students.
1	@IBJIYONGI @mcnees @Mad_Science_Guy Step away from the eggnog  McNees.
1	@masequeira1 @PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI At 18  you're often advanced if you know enough to do your own laundry.
1	@masequeira1 @PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI And in what other field are we expecting people to demonstrate deep intellectual insight at EIGHTEEN?!?
1	@IBJIYONGI @PlanetDr ESG at MIT was pretty amazing. I'm so glad I started out that way.
1	@PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI I finally mastered E&amp;M when I took a class on motors. It moved into a physical  kinematic part of my brain.
1	@IBJIYONGI @PlanetDr Because that's who a lot of the professoriate is made of. And so the cycle continues....
1	@PlanetDr @IBJIYONGI And the signaling works in the opposite reinforcing way if you're "in". "Ah yes  I -do- know this  because I'm special"
1	@Summer_Ash @Cheekmergency @mcnees Merry Cheeksmas  Estonia!
1	@Summer_Ash @Cheekmergency @mcnees "Translate from Estonian"? https://t.co/Yr0JaPI8IZ
1	@Summer_Ash @mcnees @IBJIYONGI Queen of the Cheekdom
1	@DrRubidium @mcnees Oh my gawd.
-1	@mcnees You sit on a throne of lies.
1	@mcnees @CavanaghTom We couldn't believe it!!!!!!!!! (Also  I'm only pretending that I wasn't about as excited as she was)
1	@nhuntwalker @Summer_Ash @astronomeara @SCTrager Seconded!!!!
1	@nhuntwalker @astronomeara @Summer_Ash @SCTrager Yes!!!  THERE WILL BE NO OTHER!!!
1	@nhuntwalker @SCTrager @astronomeara @Jidenna Prince?
1	@SCTrager @astronomeara @nhuntwalker Has someone come up with the definitive #BlackHarryPotter Lockhart yet?
1	@nhuntwalker @astronomeara Naw. She's too smart and focused. I'm going with Ginny. Though she could ham it up as Bellatrix.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash Must be! One benefit having totally different jobs is that work-related convos focus on the meta level.
1	@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash I was very touched when my future husband asked me about "the TAC" when we were dating.
-1	@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash Yeah  I avoid the what in pretty much all non-work situations.
-1	@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash "I've been struggling with this thing that is tedious and hard  but now I've figured out a good solution"
1	@nhuntwalker @niais @Summer_Ash I'd bet they do care and can understand the "how"  if not the "what".
1	@laurawatkins_ @michelle_lmc "We invited several but they were all busy"
-1	@michelle_lmc (Saw the meeting name downstream -- sorry for lack of due diligence)
1	@michelle_lmc Can I ask what meeting? Also  men should consider boycotting as well.
1	@galaxyhistorian @astronomolly @jbprime Resolution won't be as good  unfortunately!
1	@mcnees 😮
1	@mcnees Ok fine. I'll just be over here figuring out how I can see it again tomorrow.
1	@mcnees There was a nearly infinite number of ways they could have screwed it up AND THEY DIDNT!!!!!
1	@mcnees Same. Perfect.
1	@gwmck @Alex_Parker I was wondering if that was your R2  Grant!
1	@nhuntwalker I usually double or triple the crust recipe then freeze a bunch of dough circles so I can make more on a moments notice...
1	@mcnees @Summer_Ash She feeling better?
1	@Summer_Ash @mcnees For real!!!!
1	@jegpeek @astronomolly #HDST
1	@mcnees @orzelc I haven't seen the show  but there really isn't a whole lot of psychological depth to most characters in the book.
1	@astronomeara THAT SUIT!!!!!
1	@astrotweeps Neato!
1	@astrotweeps This is a gripping story!
1	@lukedones Bonkers. I'm old enough to remember when z=0.5 was high z. 10000 reasonable candidates at z&gt;4 was not what I expected to ever see
1	@astrokiwi @astrotweeps That is a terrific ritual!
1	@astronomeara I Dirac-delta'd it.
1	@13adh13 wth?
1	@sir_galahead @NolaTRedd @universetoday true dat
-1	@masequeira1 yeah  nip it in the bud. Two of daughter's elem. teachers told class they hated math. Not helping.
1	@GruntledChalkie but I knew she could do all the skills he claimed she lacked.
1	@GruntledChalkie honestly  I'm not really sure what that means  curriculum-wise.
1	@GruntledChalkie at her old school in Minnesota  most of the kids were 2 to 3 years below the level they were supposed to be by 2nd grade.
1	@astrotweeps @astronobeads that is nice
-1	@Nancy_A I miss the leaves turning color – any snow  yet?
1	@OtherOrbScience striking!!
1	@masequeira1 wow! Great party.
1	@DavidBflower ah  I get it. For a moment I envisioned you with an unfurled poster in your seat.
1	@DavidBflower @FlyDeltaA @KLM loose???
1	@masequeira1 wow  you are doing this birthday right! Felicitations!
1	@michealjroberts @astrofrog ha! That is the actual year I learned Fortran
1	@13adh13 yes  yes it is.
-1	@13adh13 So  someone probably had to think up this fashion stunt in the first place.
1	@13adh13 is this real? From last night  or another time.
1	@JohnDebes thank you for finding this so fast.
-1	@michael_w_busch @fossilfriendly @sondy unbelievably  10 percent of adults in Florida cannot vote for this reason
1	@sondy @karinsandstrom good luck! very interested in your experiences.
1	@NGC3314 lol me too
1	@cosmos4u ah.  Still  people are so mobile these days  especially in Florida.
-1	@cosmos4u what  worse than Katrina?
1	@kevinschawinski @luca_fowler @vrooje @AnnaKWeigel I was just thinking the same thing!
1	@JayQPublic all right  I will keep this in case my Twitter gets flooded
1	@sondy I'm possibly willing. Pls email details.
1	@NGC3314 Yeah  right. I went through something similar for DPS.
1	@NGC3314 do you mean as a captcha?
1	@spacejammie @hauck But even there you can get it down to 20 hours/week. At R1 institutions  maybe it is only 5-10 hours of your time.
1	@spacejammie @hauck Well  it depends on where you go. A "Teaching institution" will have you working 20-40 hours/week on your courses.
1	@hauck @spacejammie Me  too. In the beginning I spent 6-8 hours prep for each hour of lecture. Oy!
1	@hauck @spacejammie Yes  but counting hours works for both types. I recommend that for clarity.
-1	@hubbahubble @nytimes and I have been criticized at work for not speaking enough. Yet  often crickets or interrupting when I do talk.
1	@Paladin1969 @brianwolven lol
1	@brianwolven 👌
-1	@brianwolven ah! Now I get it  unfortunately
1	@brianwolven I don't get it.
1	@kennicosmith good to know
1	@kennicosmith i'm going to try the grating frozen butter
1	@gravitate_to_me @jjfplanet somebody needs to go wake up Jonathan
1	@astronomeara not saying for now. But soon.
1	For those interested in what I did last week @astrotweeps  it's been put in 'storify' form  below: https://t.co/rbMqmc6wMC
1	@verbiscer Thank you  Anne!
1	@ArjaRoxe Thank you!
1	@verbiscer Thank you!
1	I probably won't be tweeting much here this week  because I'm hosting @astrotweeps til Sunday. Come join us there!
-1	@gwmck @wkerslake ah. It's the "simultaneously" part that I missed. No  I don't them all at once. Very weird.
1	@wkerslake @gwmck I actually see all 12. Is this a joke?
1	@JohnDebes what is this?
1	@Rainmaker1973 I really like this - thanks for sharing it.
1	@cbellh47 nice work! Looks like the outburst is over and the comet is going back to normal
1	@cbellh47 thx
1	@cbellh47 Nice result  Charles. What do you estimate the magnitude to be right now?
-1	@astronomeara  damn ear worm!
1	@Paleophile literally. Read my other tweets
1	@cbellh47 what is your estimated magnitude?
1	@cosmos4u @gabonn like something from Batman movie
1	@DrPhiltill which journal????
1	@DoctorZen @iGrrrl @drugmonkeyblog also  POs weigh programmatic balance  portfolio  geographic issues  and others. #NSFrotator
1	@cbellh47 thx. I'd like to know your mag estimate.
1	@cbellh47 are you really???? Hot dog.
1	@cbellh47 anymore obs of 174p?
1	@brianwolven @ObservatoryCats same
1	@outseide @waidr @noaliekate ??
1	@NGC3314 oh. I believe it.
1	@NGC3314 what is your guess?
1	Congratulations to Dr. Ophelia George for her successful dissertation defense today! #geosciences @USFResearch https://t.co/rX14gHtSqy
1	@samayanissanke @gravitate_to_me Ah  well  congrats for solving that problem!
1	@gravitate_to_me @samayanissanke (that I was PO for)
1	@gravitate_to_me @samayanissanke Ah  thanks. Now I wonder what happened to his NSF grant.
1	@gravitate_to_me @samayanissanke did he move? I thought he was at Colorado
1	@NGC3314 I find that standing in the shade helps  as my Celestial navigator father taught me
-1	@aussiastronomer ugh
1	@SungrazerComets @StarkeyStardust what are our odds?
1	@brianwolven @asrivkin why am I not surprised?
1	@Paleophile our antenna is barely up to the challenge - $7 dealie from grocery store. So happy to pull in NBC #radioastronomer
1	@_hroe @PlanetDr @NewsfromScience yes  but I remember they were going to put out something more detailed in August or September
1	@PlanetDr I don't see a link  but email faith vilas to find out more fvilas@nsf.gov
1	@PlanetDr AFIK  it's the same as the AAG  but has no November 15 deadline.  I'll see if I can find a link.
1	@InvaderXan time for one of my fave cat pics: https://t.co/NNmVHmH0ce
1	@dizzheart @chicagotribune more like "wife wins medal"
1	@NGC3314 yes  you're correct about the beams. We did make lots of bizarre jokes on that job  though.
-1	@sondy Sorry! soldier on
-1	@Pharaoness I must have studied for it wrong - there were no strawberries involved
1	@JohnDebes @startorialist @LandsEnd so did my daughter until she could read
-1	@JLGalache @billclinton @HillaryClinton sick of this
1	@firejohn78 both
1	@CyborgN8VMari oh  the power
1	@shannonmstirone @sondy btdt
1	@VealSlab okay thx
1	@JohnDebes @BenneHolwerda I always vote
-1	@JohnDebes @BenneHolwerda regardless  I think it's important to educate whenever possible
1	@JohnDebes @BenneHolwerda Florida is not one of those states  however
-1	@JohnDebes @BenneHolwerda yes it's strange to live in an area that is dominated by one party. Temptation is not to vote.
-1	@JohnDebes  what's the dilemma? You're allowed to have opinions
1	@algi80 I got everything else  but was missing the Roman empire analogy. Srsly hoping for Clinton win here.
1	@algi80 ?
1	@gnorth @pugmum1 I'm there!
1	@masequeira1 wondering the same thing...
1	@merrdiff @KyleCranmer this is really cool - I'm glad you summarized everything.
1	@lukedones @astromarkmarley Everyone knows that Friday afternoon is always saved for the best.
1	@godFreeWorld great! How much practicing/playing in typical week?
1	@JamesVanFleet @CBSNews @winknews omg no! What's the rest of this story?
1	@asrivkin @brianwolven ok phew. Hope to see these tonight back at the hotel
-1	@brianwolven @asrivkin are some of these not safe for anything? Let me know
1	@NGC3314 agreed
1	@erinleeryan @PlanetTreky yup
1	@hauck ooh I love the headwaters
1	@sondy Hmm  maybe add some salts/gatorade-type-stuff? Maybe just go home and rest. I hope you're feeling better soon.
1	@sondy Are you dehydrated?
1	@jacobrichardson thank you for telling me what that is!
1	@JacquelynGill woot! here are some more 'Congratulations' for you!
1	@JacquelynGill hooray! What agency?
-1	@kat_volk @NolaTRedd Having been there last year  I suspect texting-while-touristing.
1	@AliumBritt @merrdiff lol  right! not really  oh well
1	@AliumBritt @merrdiff at least they are still spherical  right? 😀
1	@lukedones Sounds obscene. &amp; looks like it might get Tallahassee more than Tampa. Already sopping wet here
-1	@JohnDebes uggggggh  that's awful
1	@JacquelynGill @emilylurice does not surprise me
1	@asrivkin @astrotweeps oh! I didn't know that. Haven't been there this week. Off to catch up.
1	@cpm5280 nice!
-1	@sondy sounds horrible. Reminiscent of my daughter's previous experience w/nut allergy - epipens  etc. I hope you have what you need now.
-1	@sondy ugh!
1	@PBarmby @mcnees @physicsmatt just wondering. Someone I told showed me that Wikipedia changed it back to 'alive' so it was confusing
1	@physicsmatt thank you
1	@Juan_Kinda_Guy @physicsmatt Wikipedia is waffling on this. Earlier today it was reversed.
1	@physicsmatt thank you  I couldn't find it
1	@physicsmatt link/proof?
1	@mcnees thank you!
1	@PeterDEdmonds @RetractionWatch @charlicarpenter this one leaves out the ever popular never introducing her at all.
1	@PeterDEdmonds @HuffPostWomen I think this kind of satire does more harm than good.
1	@kevinschawinski @keckobservatory yep! I never drink coffee until the Hale-Bopp perihelion year
1	@godFreeWorld I used to live there #gradschooldays
-1	@godFreeWorld jealous. Where?
1	@David_A_Cocklin @themagster3 great job!
1	@tomkerss 30s=old age? Oy
1	@danfalk about your "supposedly" – is this is too good to be true?
-1	@asrivkin @brianwolven @Valgren6 @HopeJahren Those are deadly. I had to have an intervention once  years ago.
1	@DrPhiltill I still like it
1	@DrPhiltill I always loved that phrase -"mass wasting"
-1	@JohnDebes @jfaherty okay  I was afraid there  for a sec
1	@JohnDebes @jfaherty was?
1	@AmandaFreise really? What are you using?
1	@lukedones I just want to read the science!!
-1	@emcconover @airandspace I really do not enjoy that museum
-1	@Paladin1969 @starwars @noaliekate very sad!
1	@CyborgN8VMari no  not on mute. Pls carry on.
1	@MCNebrewla @merrdiff try asking to have them waived.
1	@merrdiff @MCNebrewla yes. True.  Although I do know academics who have paid for this out of their own pocket.
1	@MCNebrewla @merrdiff wait til you go to publish it in journals #itgetsworse
1	@Astroguyz barely there = time wasting. In that case I work on something else instead
1	@AscendingNode I have pre1998  but what are you looking for?
1	@DrShepherd2013 @sagesteele mine too  enjoy!
1	@masequeira1 @mcnees saving to watch later.
1	@gnorth @JohnRMoffitt @maximaxoo @marsrader @StarChild_100 @loretobgude @DeepStuff omg is it Friday again?
1	@DrJoVian @StellarPlanet you can do fax over computer. Btw
1	@biphenyl mine too!
1	@RichardFPenn yes  that was a kind of experiment in itself
-1	@kevinschawinski @HIgalaxies how far are the galaxies roughly  z?
1	@kevinschawinski @HIgalaxies are those ripply things artifacts?
1	@Pharaoness that's exactly what I said about Ryden's book. None of my students would red the foot notes!
1	@masequeira1 @mlmarshall13 As an older introvert  I tell you that this continues  but points replaced by assignments  promotions...
-1	@dvcotton @ArjaRoxe I dunno- in one case the person is afraid of being raped/killed. #notthesame
1	@lukedones @LokiVolcano i'm guessing that's a beer joke.😄
1	@kgusler @sarahcoll_14 @zipthepip @cherrylkd @MichaelJewell78 @Smith83K @frankidemerle @ptgelci Wow  I had no idea this was Fri. until this.
1	@sondy It's tweets like these that confuse me - I keep thinking you already have your doctorate....
-1	@sondy @lukedones ps. you're not a fool.
-1	@sondy @lukedones well  maybe I'm wrong about .asc.
-1	@lukedones @sondy oooh  that's really bad
1	@lukedones @sondy Isn't that just ascii??? plain text  I mean?
-1	@sondy does Kurucz go that low? https://t.co/Bdh9KWWugo
1	@PeterDEdmonds @marynmck @MIT I really think this is pervasive - not just at MIT
1	@CyborgN8VMari that is really deep
1	@sondy your profile pic is great! Where was it taken?
1	@JohnDebes please go on ....
1	@lukedones @BadassoftheWeek @JarodAnderson woot!  Looks like the one in my backyard
-1	@Robotbeat @caorann9 @NativeApprops -understood you  so let it go. Now I see that is what you meant. I disagree w/u.
1	@Robotbeat @caorann9 @NativeApprops Chris  your 1st reply seemed to put cult app in a positive light  or at least neutral. I thought I mis-
-1	@RichardFPenn I know. But think of a painful memory  and imagine your brain refusing to "go there" anymore
1	@RichardFPenn seems like my brain has learned to screen out particular things over the years
1	@CyborgN8VMari heart-breaking
1	@R_Trotta yes  for real &amp; I've got to go.  Lofoten Isl in Norway. It's not mine. I have no idea where it came from - seen it all my life.
1	@StarzanPlanets totally forgot to include her Twitter handle @starstryder
1	@starstryder @twenty3eighty4 congratulations!
1	@asrivkin @astro_Liz @KalunaHeather @pyroxena @HiCommander @CarlyHowett That would be fun  I'll think about it.
1	@ahenk75 @AlanStern I hadn't heard about the Star Trek test before
1	@john1966olsen happy weekend to you too!
1	@john1966olsen i'm quite safe. I took the picture through my binoculars ￼
1	@FODcdn @SkyandTelescope @fauxtaographer how can you not be impressed by Saturn?
1	@FODcdn @SkyandTelescope @fauxtaographer its up in the daytime frequently
1	@JohnDebes #mariaisjealous
1	@lukedones @nick_attree @elakdawalla @AlanStern @verge the Chiron's going to be my fave car now
-1	@verbiscer @elakdawalla yes  now I remember *that* ring  but had forgotten the name of the moon assoc w/it. My bad. Thx!
1	@verbiscer @elakdawalla ?
1	@elakdawalla @lukedones verry interesting
1	@masequeira1 what is the real fluff?
1	@gnorth Was ist das?
1	@jacobrichardson @USFResearch it's crazy. The lighting wasn't the greatest for pics  so I had to overly lighten the bkgd to see your faces
1	@masequeira1 of course  you're welcome. But thank you for running with it.
1	@masequeira1 @mcnees You're great at this. I'm so glad you wrote it up and put it on a blog &amp; that it's getting attention
1	Congratulations to new PhD @jacobrichardson ! From @USFResearch #VolcanoesonMars https://t.co/hcNtjDqKz5
1	@masequeira1 Fantastic job  Mark!
1	@CyborgN8VMari Now I have to start over again w/friends in this town
1	@CyborgN8VMari She said shd have been done slowly  over time  in a non-disruptive way. wth. She's very liberal  progressive  this threw me
1	@TristinaWright @CyborgN8VMari Sadly  I learned a few weeks ago that someone I used to consider a friend believes this.
1	@CyborgN8VMari @SignyTheSage Good (I think)
1	@LarsTheWanderer @NASAWatch lol.  I'm guessing it was on his bucket list to do before the year was up
1	@CyborgN8VMari omg r u ok?
1	@astromarkmarley @lukedones trust?? Seriously? Wow I'm impressed
1	@lukedones @astromarkmarley Okay  now I feel like I'm watching bizarro episode of Jeopardy
1	@masequeira1 this is a really good idea. I'm so glad you're doing it
1	@masequeira1 omigosh how exciting!!! Seeeee - this will be great visibility for the students' work. Pls let me know when it's up.
1	@maximaxoo @gnorth @JohnRMoffitt @loretobgude @fcain Nice!

1	@lukedones @AlsBoy so  like a week before your next deadline?

1	@upulie no they are actually doing something different. I'll try to find a better article
1	#GravitationalWaves ripple through social media - story highlights tweets from many I know on Twitter https://t.co/PhFxCAOCKB via @dwnews
1	@astronomeara happy birthday to you  too!
1	So  in effect  @DrMLHarris of @PhysicsWorld says don't worry so much about the cake picture of #LIGO announcement... https://t.co/tp8wk03ID0
1	@RachelFeltman @kimberlykowal So wait - was the bakery instructed to keep the embargo?
1	@lukedones yes  me too!
1	@BlackPhysicists @mcnees okay.... Thx
-1	@masequeira1 my hair is clean and soft  so works for me. Totally nerdy
1	.@BlackPhysicists @MIT well it feels pretty clean to me
1	@JayQPublic not precipitation
1	@phalpern In Tallahassee - I know the one. I didn't know he had another.
1	@GruntledChalkie not without coffee!
1	@GruntledChalkie Oh  okay. You say it like you think it's easy or something.
1	@timmermansr Ooooh.  There are parts of Minnesota I miss and we were thinking of taking a winter vacation like that next year. Gotta link?
1	@timmermansr What kind of trip/vacation are you taking? Where  what  when  how? Looks great.
1	If you're not already following @astrotweeps and @astromarkmarley  start now #astronomyfun #exoplanets #solarsystem https://t.co/Oj45Jyhdad
1	@astrotweeps good! I found this confusing when I was at NSF.  I remember asking someone to name their model  don't remember who it was
1	@masequeira1 I actually like the snow and if it's not too cold. But not 20 below
1	@masequeira1 well I paid my dues with 14 Minnesota winters
1	@masequeira1 we had A week or two where the highs climbed only into the 60s!  In hindsight  it was winter
1	@StellarPlanet @DrJoVian you know we want to see it  though
-1	@erickstephen @FOX13News @BN9 ugh. Hate this. I'm glad it's over
1	.@FOX13News Kids at King now being told that #KingHighSchool lockdown is over.
1	@erickstephen @FOX13News @BN9 I got a robocall saying it was only modified lockdown
-1	.@StellarPlanet yes  I didn't know what to make of the pulsar planets a few years before  but w/51 Peg  I thought "ok  this is serious."
1	@StellarPlanet I do remember  talking about the exoplanet discoveries in my first astronomy courses at Penn State Erie  as new prof.
1	@solarstellar @StellarPlanet me  too!
-1	@Paleophile It's not unbelievable  just stupid. Especially because  oh well  never mind.
1	@Paleophile Yes  let's!
1	@kevinmgill @LEGO_Group Holy animation  Batman! Well done.
-1	@CyborgN8VMari I totally get this and am facing similar struggle
1	@Nancy_A Yeah  and I think Pi is too long  too. Ask them to shorten it.
1	@masequeira1 Yes and apparently a 'botox brow' as the article explains. Hmmm.
1	@masequeira1 omg don't even get me started. Hugs come rarely these days  maybe even seasonally.
1	@JacquelynGill I wish I'd have thought of that answer....
1	@megschwamb great  thanks for the link.
-1	@megschwamb Psl post a 'cheat sheet' of your talk.
1	@masequeira1 yes  exactly!
1	@lukedones uh-oh
1	@astrokatey I like how you can just report to NSF instead of depending on the institution's title 9 office. Still  we will see.
-1	@lukedones oh no  then that really is crazy
1	@astrokatey but will they? It'll be interesting to see agencies enforce this.
1	@lukedones I hope you weren't texting/twittering
1	@DrPhiltill @AlanStern @NewHorizons2015 yes  I did  actually
-1	@boundangle I don't know  probably numbered in order discovered  but am not going to worry about it  actually.
1	@ProfChrisWelch thx  new word for me.
1	@ProfChrisWelch what does the namechecked mean?
1	@john1966olsen happy weekend to you  too!
1	.@SungrazerComets @sandygrains Of course  if confirmed  it should really be called "Planet 9 form Outer Space"
1	@SungrazerComets @sandygrains lol! (but no!)
1	@LCTTA @SungrazerComets Yes  indeed!
1	@masequeira1 same here. But we have a few weeks to do this
1	@erinleeryan @lukedones @barbylon so where you going?
1	@TrueSciPhi sounds about right
1	@sondy thanks for writing that. I wish I could help more than I am.
1	@Paladin1969 @bertrandom Ah  you were more of an engineer  then?
-1	@masequeira1 Sadly  no it's too big for cheesecake. But perhaps I should test that.
-1	@Mario_Livio @LIGO These rumors of rumors are getting annoying.
-1	@boundangle yes  I remember that. I always hated the name
-1	@dvcotton @ArjaRoxe Yeah  and anyway  the pattern to deal with is the abuse  not the trigger.
1	@dvcotton @ArjaRoxe And  yes  it's hard to recognize it in self  but well worth the time it takes.
1	@dvcotton @ArjaRoxe I assume you're referring to Ott. If so  I also read complaints from men  unrelated to unrequited love.
-1	.@dvcotton @lizstrahle @ArjaRoxe Mainly  I think people should learn to recognize &amp; deal with abusive/controlling behavior in self &amp; others.
1	@ArjaRoxe @dvcotton Some may call it old-fashioned  but it's just having good boundaries.
1	@ArjaRoxe That’s not old-fashioned. :)
-1	@ArjaRoxe @dvcotton antiquated?
-1	.@dvcotton @ArjaRoxe these problems arise from issues of control/power  not from romantic feelings. People shld educate themselves abt abuse
-1	Heart doctors outraged Florida dumps hospital standards after big gifts to GOP @CNN https://t.co/xIq7n5LzQO
-1	@masequeira1 okay  I see. Grim plan
1	@masequeira1 what is a designated survivor
-1	@CathRn111 @STEMJeff That's really awful  but promising that experienced teachers are better
1	@Gizmodo @jeremythomas33 good timing – Just as my teenage daughter learns to drive
1	@DrMRFrancis tip: use transcribing software for most of it
-1	@awgonnerman yes looked dead
1	@JayQPublic no I wouldn't think so
1	@DrMRFrancis Thanks  I've seen that done before
-1	@DrMRFrancis Am I missing something - is this a new request?
1	@dssearcher2 lol makes you wonder
1	@erinleeryan @sondy thx Erin!
1	Want to go to grad school in planetary science? Here's a good resource/tool from AAS DPS  https://t.co/BhP3GXdNEU  @sondy @DPSCommittee
1	@sondy NSF is easy to search  but NASA harder. Funding also usually/sometimes acknowledged in papers  meeting abstracts.
1	@sondy Also look at DPS  AGU  LPSC abstracts for universities.
1	@sondy Well  always in motion  the future (and funding) is  but she/he should look at who is being funded in the areas of interest.
1	@sondy There's lots more.  But are you talking about astronomy  plan sci  geology  chem  physics? What kind of program?
1	@lukedones @PeterDEdmonds Thanks  Luke!
1	@PeterDEdmonds Who is the astronomy person?
1	@AstroKatie @DrMRFrancis @blakestacey he was the highlight of the movie to my 14 yo dtr
1	@DrMRFrancis @hpcprogrammer New year near winter solstice makes more sense to me. Kind of like a new Moon starting out of darkness
1	@gwmck no kidding
-1	@DrMRFrancis stop - you're ruining my Sunday
1	@SungrazerComets whoa!
1	@gwmck uh oh I hope that's good
1	@merrdiff Macys does
-1	@DrMRFrancis @merrdiff this is why I hate seeing Marie Curie as a role model
1	@Astroguyz Yep!
-1	@NGC3314 I hate when that happens. It's always a good idea to insert a relevant nonsense word to make files easier to find later #lifehack
1	@Paladin1969 me  too!!
1	@startorialist thanks for letting me know
1	@Paladin1969 yay - enjoy
1	@gnorth you betcha!
-1	@telescoper @GeertHub pic missing
1	@radjanirad @theAGU it is awesome
1	@astrotweeps thank you!
1	@awgonnerman how old is he?
1	@Wikisteff @OtherOrbScience indeed
1	@kevinschawinski I may have to mute you for a few days
1	@kevinschawinski geesh. I know.
1	@kevinschawinski cool. I'm not going until next Tuesday
1	@kevinschawinski when you going?
1	@cathomas09 evidently  lots of people are looking past the test scores  since the U.S. prize fellows also got in somewhere....
1	.@PeterDEdmonds @NatureComms I concluded public accountability explains  a lot with peer review recommendations
1	@astronomeara @NatureComms pilot?
1	@RiAus I can only dream of such an honour!
1	@PlasmaNerd @realscientists OK  well my advice would be to trust yourself and know that you are an expert. Be confident and enjoy!
1	@PlasmaNerd @realscientists Why would you think that?
1	@PlasmaNerd @realscientists Journalists have very short deadlines  that's the nature of the job. Sometimes less than an hour to write.
1	@PlasmaNerd @realscientists why is that  if you don't mind me asking?
1	@realscientists @PlasmaNerd in my experience no  journalists need info on specific stories within the hour  not general info occasionally.
1	@Astrophiz Would love to! Let's talk.
1	Fed up with politics? Watch @astroduff talking with @ProfBrianCox on @RiAus about physics. Fantastic stuff! https://t.co/sd0NVrucyF
1	@BlackPhysicists @Helen_E_MC I don't live in South Australia. It's one of the less populous states of australia.
1	@BlackPhysicists @Helen_E_MC People might be better off if they use evidence more and opinion less.
1	@AunatEridu @astroduff Yep. I actually took part in a survey for this article.
1	@pauldutton1968 @AAOastro *nobody move. They only detect motion*
1	@gravitate_to_me Oh  very cool.  How long until we can probe IMBH mergers via GWs?

1	@MJIBrown @strom_m thanks Michael!
1	@thereminfan thanks! 😀
1	@_sarahmartell_ @eurekaprizes @austmus Thanks bud!
1	@BenneHolwerda @SCTrager @astronomolly @Harcel @mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 fvour-wearrrrrrrrrrrp then. Simple.
1	@mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 @BenneHolwerda emphasis on 'four'
1	@mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 @BenneHolwerda four-werp.
1	@jsalsman @AstroKatie @PeterCawdron and what is the consequence of this?
-1	@Nightskyonline @perthobs lol. No air in space doesn't mean you can't get irradiated to death!
1	@Nightskyonline @perthobs this is assuming you have an atmosphere and benchmarking off a familiar situation (a home heater). ...
1	@Nightskyonline @perthobs at 150 km  you could have 2 x 10^10 times the power of a home heater and still be OK. Sand grain is 10^20 x power
1	@Nightskyonline @perthobs A home heater is ~500W. You'd sit about a metre from it and be OK. Extend that to 150 km &amp; heat spreads over 1/r^2
1	@Nightskyonline @perthobs is it by radiant heat  or by heating an assumed volume of air surrounding it?
1	@Nightskyonline @perthobs Still not sure exactly how that kills a person. Ideas?
1	@Nightskyonline @perthobs So the total power radiated in all directions by the sand grain is 6 x 10^22 Watts.
1	@Nightskyonline @perthobs Surface area of a medium sand grain is 4 x pi x r^2 with a radius of 250 microns  this area is 7.8 x 10^-7 m^2.
1	@Nightskyonline @perthobs Energy = 2.87 x 10^21 W/square metre
1	@Nightskyonline @perthobs Start with Stefan's Law: Energy = sigma x T^4 where sigma is stefan's constant.
1	@Nightskyonline @perthobs Not sure what assumptions are. Radiant heat from a 15 million degree sand grain?
1	@perthobs @Nightskyonline how?
1	Talking space at Leichhardt School - such clever questions! @CSIROSMiS @Aus_ScienceWeek #NatSciWk #5ScientistPledge https://t.co/3kDxxd6Veu

1	I love #scicomm when things like this happen @MacAstroSoc @Ggreybeard @JohnRombi https://t.co/Psd67UD5bb
1	@Thinking__Cat @SKA_telescope @SYD_astrofest I did the @WorldSciFest in Brisbane a couple of months ago and I'm sure there will be others.
-1	@amyekimball @naomimcgriff and therein lies the problem. You don't feel safe.
-1	@amyekimball @naomimcgriff dude  come on. Anti sodomy laws are anti lgbti laws. Threat of five years in prison is not 'family friendly'
-1	@amyekimball @naomimcgriff that page says five years in prison. Sodomy laws are deliberately targeted against gay men.
1	Had a great evening at @MacAstroSoc  speaking about black holes and colliding galaxies. Thanks all! https://t.co/oiqTCyixcP
1	@Aus_ScienceWeek @questacon @SKA_Australia @SNAICC Yep - they will be in the audience. Definitely talk abt that.
1	@Aus_ScienceWeek @questacon @SKA_Australia @SNAICC :-)
1	@Aus_ScienceWeek @questacon @SKA_Australia @SNAICC zzzzzzzzzzzzz
-1	@Aus_ScienceWeek @questacon @SKA_Australia @SNAICC My biggest fear in life is boring people.
-1	@Ggreybeard I chose the cheapest fare - unfortunately. I won't make the mistake of travelling with Etihad again.
1	On Monday 18 July I'm speaking abt #blackholes and #galaxies at a free #astronomy event in Campbelltown @MacAstroSoc https://t.co/IavkkjRAls
1	@amyekimball @RadioNational Oh yes  that's another winner. God bless the Netherlands.
1	@DRG_physics @the2016asa What do you think...?
-1	@hula_clay @SydScienceFest @maasmuseum @astroduff A bit hard to tweet when I'm hosting I'm afraid. Hopefully someone will!
-1	@aprilfollies @egaly @AstroKatie @DrRubidium and be aware that you might not hear about it because women warn women about the harrassers
1	@egaly @AstroKatie @DrRubidium Hire women. Promote them.
1	@GMTelescope Next conference you should add G&amp;Ts to that wheel ;-)

1	@drannawatts @jr_pritchard @SpaceSchoolUK Wow  yes. I will never forget that. @SpaceSchoolUK was fantastic.
1	@astronomyblog Well said!
1	@RiAus In the first 5 years  about ten thousand. 100 currently known. (I'm referring to colliding galaxies that emit 'megamasers')
1	@RiAus I'm calculating the number of molecular signals from colliding galaxies that we will find with our new radio telescope  ASKAP.

1	@CanberraDSN @ABCstarstuff @CSIROnews Nice shot! Here's my entry..... http://t.co/0yX1tdvG0f
1	@SeanMElliott @AstroKatie @Helen_E_MC you got it!
1	@AstroKatie @Helen_E_MC I held a mirror up in my mind.....
1	@brendonbrewer @mathemaniac I think in pictures mostly. Actual equations not so much.
1	@aussiestargazer @NBCFAus well done!
1	@DoctorKarl @worldscifest sounds great  would love to do a gig there!
1	@AstroExeter @SKA_telescope @jodrellbank I sure am! :-)
1	@answerpc no.
1	@BlackPhysicists Yeah thanks. I have a mild ankle sprain and some tendon soreness  but nothing that shouldn't heal. It was a wonderful week!
-1	@BlackPhysicists No  it's not a high-tech affair I'm afraid. You'll have to imagine.
1	@AstroExeter @AstroKatie @DoctorKarl @Sharpie081 @sylmobile Look forward to seeing you there @AstroExeter !
1	@AussiePhinatic @DoctorKarl @sylmobile @Sharpie081 I understand it will be recorded by @UNSWPhysics and put on their YouTube channel.
1	@BlackPhysicists @SciBry There are some plans to develop citizen science for SKA (currently the pathfinders). @radiogalaxyzoo is great.
1	@BlackPhysicists @SciBry Sounds like a good idea. Are these chats on twitter?
1	@BlackPhysicists @ComradesRace no  I'm doing some longer races this year.
1	@Helen_E_MC Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur Hur :-)
1	Learn what inspires #CSIRO astronomer Lisa Harvey-Smith in this short @Science_Academy interview! https://t.co/YP5RJ1GEtI @lisaharveysmith
1	@Erica_Vowles @RadioNational cheers Erica  thanks for having me!
1	@thereminfan @YogaGlo totally! 😀
1	@thereminfan @YogaGlo I've got 60km of run training this weekend  so I reckon I can handle it!

1	@MeReachingout @thereminfan @ESA_Rosetta It's clear that we disagree on this issue. Enjoy the comet landing.
1	@MeReachingout @thereminfan @ESA_Rosetta When you say 'you guys' I assume you mean astrophysicists. Thanks. :-)
1	@esascience @SungrazerComets @mggtTaylor I would say inappropriate in the workplace or offputting to young women considering sci/eng careers
1	@BlackPhysicists @SKA_telescope @TheNRAO These disks are best studied at higher frequencies  need to wait for SKA high frequency receivers.
1	@MJIBrown typical rms is 0.6 mJy  more details here: http://t.co/avV4ylffBU
1	@JontiHorner Have sent you an email.
1	.@JontiHorner Satellites produce v.strong signals that affect radio telescopes. CSIRO are developing filtering techniques for SKA. #ASRC2014
-1	@JontiHorner Me too! I slept 11 hours on Sunday and 10 hours last night. Still tired.
1	@JontiHorner sure  why not! I hope we need to do that.
1	@AunatEridu @AstroRach Sounds great but no - I guess it is an internal thing.
-1	@AunatEridu @AstroRach Sorry - the what now?
1	@astronomyblog seems so!
-1	@Helen_E_MC @whereisdaz Research papers speak only to other experts. Taxpayers also have the right to know where their money is going!

1	@aussiestargazer @roberthollow @AstroKatie @JontiHorner @AstroCate Is a director or NL automatically more engaging or interesting?
1	@AstroCate @JontiHorner @AstroKatie I think as a professional society we are all collectively accountable for this.
-1	@JontiHorner @AstroKatie indeed. The WiA Chapter has a role here. #fail
1	@JontiHorner @NorthEssexAstro gave me the resources  experiences for my astronomy enthusiasm to blossom. Now I'm a professional astronomer.
1	@CSIROSMiS @btucker22 @aliceleung Jonti Horner is an astrobiologist! @JontiHorner
-1	@ivbemmel @jr_pritchard was that quote about SKA1 low or SKA1?
1	@BlackPhysicists @ComradesRace @TeamSKA_Africa @SKA_telescope @AAS_Women Thanks so much. Your ongoing interest and support is very generous!
1	@Tim_O_Brien :-)
1	@Tim_O_Brien I got an A star! No joke :-)
1	@BlackPhysicists @daandutoit @ComradesRace I am running! http://t.co/xClJnYka9c
1	@AunatEridu @SKA_telescope @CSIROnews The CSIRO Science Operations Centre at Marsfield headquarters. Remotely operate Parkes  ATCA  ASKAP.
1	@jegpeek @Arsenal Awesome!
1	@Science_Academy @USCAR_ surname?
1	@AunatEridu I'll take that! :-)
1	@AunatEridu No  London doesn't have entry qualifications. It's just massively over-subscribed. You have to enter a lottery to get a place.
1	@AunatEridu Oh yeah  sounds like a great event. Really dream of London Marathon though. I can never get an entry.
1	@AunatEridu Are you asking if I am running Boston? If so  then no.
-1	@BlackPhysicists Bit of both. We cross soft sand dunes  including 'big red'  Australia's highest. We also cross gibber plains and salt lakes
1	Congratulations to the new Fellows of Australian Academy of Sciences. A fine bunch of recipients! http://t.co/nxUaTqLaER @Science_Academy
1	@Aus_ScienceWeek looks like I am describing a basketball!
1	@Aus_ScienceWeek I look fed up on this photo - but actually I had a great time!
1	@42jkb @ScienceAU Hey Julie - great to see you!
-1	@RoyalAstroSoc responds forcefully to @MailOnline's shameful treatment of Maggie Aderin-Pocock &amp; Hiranya Peiris https://t.co/UD4R2HPAIh
1	@jen_gupta at what distance?
1	@gravitate_to_me thanks for the RT!
1	@NASAhistory @matisidro or you could have said Caroline Herschel  astronomer.... But instead you hinged her achievements on her brother.
1	@Helen_E_MC ditto! Normally Hate early starts but running in the blueys is worth it! Enjoy
-1	@reneehlozek Don't be a pessimist. The past was more intolerant and more warlike.  Long way to go but the future is bright.
1	@ProfMike_M Looking forward to seeing it
1	@jegpeek @dalcantonJD To paraphrase Rosenblatt: the act of reading tweets  is a unique experience and your view is valid as any other
1	@jason__rhodes @Planck @Caltech How would we be able to collect on the bet?  This isn't science.
1	Has the LHC seen new physics?   @physicsmatt on the search. https://t.co/flO4FPKyX2
1	@jegpeek Wow!  That makes these talks worth giving
1	@albertoconti Thanks!  Fun to think about the potential power of WFIRST for astrometry.  GAIA should be great!
1	@aagie I also thought that we would discover the dark matter by now.
-1	@shaka_lulu @ClimateOfGavin Dyson will often admit to climate change  but argue that the mitigation costs should be put off until later.
1	@jbprime @JossBlandHawtho Congratulations!
1	@adam_m_jcbs @StartsWithABang Please apply!
1	@ProfMike_M go for it... I am going back to sleep.. Very early in New Jersey
-1	@ProfMike_M the gamma rays bursts would be the smoking gun
-1	@ProfMike_M the deep drops in the stars brightness implies that a very large comet abundance. These are killer comets
-1	@ProfMike_M maybe the comets killed the aliens?
1	@lukedones @cosmos4u Good paper on whether planets of this size are rocky: http://t.co/8yV7fUNSJe
1	@lukedones @cosmos4u Depends on its true mass
1	@cosmos4u The properties of these massive rocky planets are not well understood.  Do they have plate tectonics? Thick atmospheres?
1	@cosmos4u At 5 earth masses  it is likely rocky and it should have Earth-like effective temperatures.
1	@cosmos4u This 3-&gt;2 idea is generating interest and some criticism (see http://t.co/UjF2KSSLrE)
-1	@jbprime This article shows a misunderstanding of economics.  More supply means lower cost.
1	@dalcantonJD @AstroKatie @reneehlozek Julianne- you have always had a fondness for dwarf objects...
1	@AstroKatie @reneehlozek Most everything and everyone I love is smaller than Pluto.
-1	@AstroKatie @reneehlozek I will take Eris in a fight with Pluto
1	@AstroKatie @reneehlozek IAU is still right... pluto is a dwarf.
1	@lukedones @reneehlozek You  are right  but they are both dwarfs.  Don't let Stern reclassify Pluto
1	@reneehlozek Eris is bigger! #sizematters #plutoisadwarf
1	@reneehlozek Did it happen now or in 4 hours?  All depends on your slicing of spacetime
1	@reneehlozek Blinding reduces "confirmation bias" but often reduces ability to study foregrounds.  Useful but no panacea.
1	@reneehlozek @Perimeter When we don't understand a number  we have a chance to learn something profound.  Fine-tuning misses the opportunity
1	@AstroKatie @reneehlozek CMB acoustic fluctuations are 80 sigma detections of dark matter and probe lots of its properties.
-1	@StartsWithABang Agreed but if it is too low  we may never see it
-1	@RobertGaristo No   In the 1980s  most astronomers (and the data) favored Omega = 0.2-0.3.  This once was an argument against inflation.
1	@sasharahlin @reneehlozek We all make up theory as we go along...
1	@reneehlozek but we were right about l=1800 and systematics in the autocorrelations
1	@david_hurn @nytimes The prediction of the existence of the neutrino spurred physicists to look for ways to detect it
1	@thomaszurbuchen cmb data  large scale structure and Lensing data provide very strong independent evidence consistent with sn data
1	@astronomeara YES!  Especially given the LIthium mystery!  What are prospects?
1	@jegpeek Twitter was very useful to communicate doubts at a time when everyone was sure BICEP2 was correct.
1	@jegpeek Still need to write my lecture  so am going to wait read the papers  and think about it.
1	@shaka_lulu @jradavenport download it to your ipad
1	@brant_robertson @reneehlozek They presented two results (WMAP EE cleaned with 353) and (LFI EE cleaned with 353).
1	@brant_robertson @reneehlozek I have heard that the lower tau was presented at the Ferrara meeting but wasn't there.
1	@chris_tibbs @DrDa5id Misread the ESA web page clock.  Landing is today!
1	@robcarrphoto @Matt_Burleigh In the picture  why does the X-ray move at an angle relative to the Axion?
1	@RichardFPenn @LeeBillings Axions convert to x-rays in the B field.  X-rays should be moving away from the Sun.
1	@reneehlozek If you never miss a train  you are getting to the station too early
1	@JossBlandHawtho @jbprime So far  the media has portrayed this as "watching the sausage being made".
1	@jegpeek fun talking...hope you thrive in baltimore
1	@reneehlozek  or good day care
1	@astrojohnjohn @reneehlozek @niais @berkeleyjess @BuChanda
1	@DrMRFrancis @DudeDarkmatter @btucker22 @BadAstronomer @astroduff   H0 in the local patch  could differ by ~5% from global value
-1	@DudeDarkmatter @btucker22 @DrMRFrancis @BadAstronomer @astroduff Still think that there are problems with Planck 217 GHz.  Pushes H0 to 68.
1	@reneehlozek say hi to eiichiro
1	@R_Trotta I agree  but that is not the motivation for the human program.  NASA science mission spends about 5 B/yr- HST  Mars  US Planck .
1	@shaka_lulu Made the Washington Post article
1	@shaka_lulu You will need to ask about schmutz in the questions.  I am mostly going to be talking about the work on oscillations with Daan.
1	@peterdedmonds See you in Boston-- hope to comment on gravitational waves in the Kavli talk -- will talk about two epochs of acceleration
1	@peterdedmonds  working on the paper now
1	@cosmos4u @seanmcarroll yes.  if the foregrounds are near the minimal case  r  is around 0.1
1	@jbprime As Nancy Reagan taught us  just say no!
1	@reneehlozek  Yet you seem to function...
1	@reneehlozek Yet you see to function
-1	@ckmcbride @peterdedmonds @seanmcarroll @AstroKatie The polarization signal is very weak.  Intensity signal could leak.
1	@peterdedmonds @seanmcarroll In the midst of a crazy trip so would be hard to do. @AstroKatie would do a good job of writing something!
-1	@cosmos4u @AstroKatie @StartsWithABang  Potentially revolutionary result.  Important to think about  also important to check.
-1	@DrMRFrancis @arstechnica Sorry -- just catching up
-1	@jegpeek @astrotweeps @reneehlozek There are features in the plots that look worrying.
1	@jegpeek @astrotweeps @reneehlozek   They are definitely seeing a signal.  Need to read the paper more carefully to see if it is CMB.
1	@peterdedmonds @partialobs   Important if true
1	@peterdedmonds @partialobs   Skiing with Eiichiro Komatsu
1	@peterdedmonds @partialobs  Fun visit to Munich!  Tomorrow  I head to the Alps Watch for an interesting CMB announcement on Monday
1	@jegpeek @dalcantonJD  See  http://t.co/obEDIWtJIE  The slides from the presentation at NAS not yet on-line.  Probably tomorrow morning.
1	@jegpeek High escape fraction at high z helps a lot
1	@aagie Super Bowl is in Jersey not NYC.  Other side of the GWB! Christie is promising to not close lanes today
1	@sondy Wow. That’s some exquisite gaslighting right there.
1	@Astro_JohnCF @PenguinGalaxy  There are also 2 other videos (I’m going to share them too  eventually) at https://t.co/2lKGlawSzF
1	@kevinschawinski I admire that you think this is the bottom.
-1	@robertcnichol it's the SDSS ID - bit ridiculous to read but easy to use it to look up tons of info :)
1	@DrRob_Thacker Thanks! No worries  it’s worth it. Looks great. Safe flights! @startorialist @emilylurice @zazzle @PeterDEdmonds
1	@DrRob_Thacker That would be amazing! :) @startorialist @emilylurice @zazzle @PeterDEdmonds
1	@HughO2 @StellarPlanet I feel like it’s less about the observing runs (remote/queue is common now) and more about the conference travel.
1	@startorialist Are these for sale? I have a gift recipient in mind! @emilylurice @zazzle @DrRob_Thacker @PeterDEdmonds
1	@astronomyblog *hugs*
1	@reneehlozek Just. Why would she do that. I kept looking for some kind of self-awareness or white-feminist parody  but  no.
1	@niais @jegpeek @sarahkendrew  Eeeexcellent. https://t.co/fgs7U6vlwn
1	@niais @jegpeek @sarahkendrew  Me too! I went to sign up last month and then went “oh I need to know what to talk/unconference about. Hmm."
-1	@PeterDEdmonds yes. It and "crazy" have been used a few times at various points in talks.
1	@StellarBones @kevinschawinski It really is.
1	@kevinschawinski I nominate @StellarBones.
-1	@kevinschawinski A MNRAS editor told me Gmail changed its header requirements to be much more strict &amp; MNRAS doesn’t seem to comply.
1	@kevinschawinski Yes  due to Gmail forwarding issues. Workaround: put your direct Gmail address as a cc in MNRAS account profile.
1	@realscientists For concentration while writing  Ravel’s Bolero puts me in the zone. Then a playlist entitled “no words  not boring”.
1	@realscientists First step is giving myself time to think about a proposal &amp; not shaming myself if that takes days before I start writing.
1	@realscientists I am enjoying reading these replies but constantly doing double-take because in my field SLAC is also a Lab at Stanford.
1	@astrobellatrix @astrogrant Ooh  and slides 15 &amp; 16 too... this data is just gorgeous!
-1	I have been meaning to ask @astrogrant @astrobellatrix is any of the CARS targets are disk-dominated galaxies. #EinsteinFellows
1	@PeterDEdmonds thank you!
1	.@cosmos4u I waived the @HubbleTelescope proprietary period. My proposal was made possible by @galaxyzoo volunteers; all should have access.
1	@brendonbrewer What’re you betting? 😉
1	@jen_gupta @chrislintott +1
1	@mikamckinnon @sarahkendrew @TCRatius +a look at our timelines shows we each post on many topics. Discussion ok  topic policing not so much.
1	@TCRatius @sarahkendrew @mikamckinnon even if you'd said "y'all" I'd still have replied in the same way. Research/exploration has value.
1	@TCRatius @sarahkendrew @mikamckinnon I don't see the logic in the suggestion that we "gals" should only discuss topics you approve of.
-1	@astrokatey it'll get worse if it helps their profit margins. Everything is broken.
1	@hormiga @EvoPhD @RallidaeRule @kejames @ExpatScientist @WhySharksMatter Most ✅ men I know verified w/o request; not so for non-men I know.
1	@kejames it was weeks. Can't recall exactly how many  but long enough that I started to wonder if the form send hadn't gone through.
1	@kevinschawinski don't underestimate the power of the dark side.
1	My #observing run  part 2: https://t.co/d5Jomo8Wiw incl. @psmithgb @see_the_sky @astropixie @davecl42 @LEMacKz @BlackPhysicists @kellecruz
1	My #observing run in 2 parts. Part 1: https://t.co/cU8To3ZL3I including @bradpholden @SCTrager @ScienceNelson @jps_astro @gravitate_to_me
1	@MasoomJethwa It’s optical slit spectra of galaxies - the images are generally zoomed in on H-alpha.
1	@kevinschawinski I guess maybe I should be storifying this? @luca_fowler @AnnaKWeigel
-1	@BlackPhysicists I’m unfamiliar with this analogy though  so can’t help there. (Sorry)
1	@BlackPhysicists The dark matter halo (lots of mass) seems really important in disk &amp; bar evolution  but it’s hard to observe.
-1	@BlackPhysicists In simulations  bars form extremely easily in a “cold” (rot-dominated) disk. But they’re not observed quite as often.
1	@BlackPhysicists This phrasing seems to assume that bar formation is inevitable in a disk - which is a really interesting research topic.
1	I was lucky to do my first #observing run with expert observer @megschwamb  whose level of care  alertness &amp; planning I still aspire to.
1	@BlackPhysicists By “settle” I mean dynamically: the orbits of stars &amp; gas become rotation-dominated &amp; lie in a thin plane. That takes time.
-1	@BlackPhysicists Under simplifying assumptions  yes. In general a disk that hasn’t had time to “settle” will be stable against bar formation
-1	@BlackPhysicists … and it constrains (in a complex way) the history the galaxy has had regarding interactions (or not) with other galaxies.
1	@BlackPhysicists It often implies there’s a younger population of stars (though there may also be much older stars)…
1	@NGC3314 It seems pretty awesome - this is my first sciencing with it though. (PS got any science you want to do next semester?)
1	@stoutde yep  night 2 of 2 for this run!
1	@stoutde Yeah  it is a bonus! Science being global means there’s a conversation to be had at all hours. :) Thanks!
1	@Astro_Adept They *claim* there’s no extension cord long enough. Pfft.
1	@stoutde I think the earth is trying to do that… bring some stuff in from the Pacific so those in the Rockies can ski!
1	@ScienceNelson Yay! Observing can feel like a really distanced space sometimes. I’m glad for Twitter. :)
1	@stoutde Someday! And our first priority will obviously be perfect conditions atop mountains that have observatories. 😀
1	@BlackPhysicists I’m at @LickObservatory  on Mount Hamilton  at the Shane 3m. The spectrograph is great so I really want to get some data!
-1	@stoutde If the air suddenly dried up right now they’d still have to wait for wind to evaporate the dew  to avoid drips onto the mirror.
-1	@stoutde The dew is all on the building exterior. When it’s this bad they won’t even open the dome for fear of damage like what you mention.
1	@stoutde Thanks! It happens. Bummer  but there’s always hope...
1	@kevinschawinski Tonight &amp; tomorrow for this run. Tomorrow’s forecast is not really any better.
1	@jr_pritchard @dalcantonJD @jbprime @acooray Maybe NASA could offer incentives for fellows to look beyond the Big Names.
1	@jr_pritchard @dalcantonJD @jbprime @acooray Isn't the increase in research-driven faculty at smaller schools also a landscape change?
1	@dalcantonJD @jbprime @acooray @jr_pritchard Gut reaction: this feels like people pulling the ladder up after they’ve climbed.
-1	@dalcantonJD @jbprime @acooray @jr_pritchard Right. I’m uncomfortable with the conclusion that fewer postdocs should be given independence.
1	@jbprime @acooray @jr_pritchard @dalcantonJD Are there any postdocs in the room when this is being discussed?
-1	@PenguinGalaxy @kevinschawinski alas I think they're all away :( have fun though! And at least you'll know you're not contagious.
1	@fringetracker @kevinschawinski It’s not entirely clear Rubin and Zwicky would have to share it but you’re Swiss so I’ll give it to you 😝
-1	@astrobellatrix consistent with this finding. Sorry  not enough room to properly say all of Kepler is short term compared to this analysis.
1	@mggtTaylor Over here it’s National Coffee Day  which seems fitting… albeit not as fitting as National Space-Mission-Induced Adrenaline Day.
-1	@kevinschawinski @Jeyhan @astrokatey Either there’s been serious post-vote backchannel chat or Congress is trying to have cake &amp; eat it too.
1	@kevinschawinski @jeyhan @astrokatey hmm  I didn’t really see this coming though: https://t.co/oUJlmzsbc7
-1	@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew Again  the argument would be more convincing if it focused on student recruitment &amp; not all outreach funding.
1	@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew Wait  we’re talking about PhDs? I thought we were talking about lectureships &amp; other permanent jobs?
-1	@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew @DrJoVian so perhaps the answer to your particular complaint is more &amp; broader outreach  +time.
1	@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew @DrJoVian another is to improve science literacy overall  which hopefully translates to more science funding.
1	@michealjroberts I admire your laser-like focus on this  but outreach is for other things too. Many of them have been mentioned already.
-1	@michealjroberts @DrJoVian @sarahkendrew you don't seem to be hearing me/us about the link between funding for jobs &amp; outreach being dubious
1	@michealjroberts @DrJoVian @sarahkendrew "can afford" and "willing to afford" are completely different things.
1	@michealjroberts @DrJoVian @sarahkendrew we all want enough funding to support outreach &amp; all interested researchers. Also  I'd like a pony.
1	@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew this is based on the assumption that the current climate will be the future climate.
-1	@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew it's shitty you've had bad experiences. But you've also been dismissive of others with years more experience.
1	@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew by "accept the diversity of opinion" do you actually mean "accept the opinion"? It sort of sounds like that.
-1	@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew yes  funding isn't great  but that doesn't mean outreach to schools is a waste or should stop.
1	@michealjroberts @sarahkendrew I genuinely don't know anyone who does careers outreach who doesn't caution about academic job prospects.
-1	@michealjroberts and if you want to be  you can actively request that training or go somewhere that offers it by default.
1	@michealjroberts people who want to be that kind of astronomer. It's not that nobody should be  it's that not everyone has to be.
-1	@michealjroberts a valid argument  if you think a professorship is the only legitimate destination on the path of a trained scientist.
-1	.@michealjroberts it's only a problem if your model for a modern astronomer is someone who knows the Vega mags of standard stars by heart.
1	@michealjroberts we are in the Big Survey era. I didn't go observing until the final year of my PhD. I know Professors who have never been.
-1	@michealjroberts @NickAstronomer @DrJoVian no argument about high fees (in US that's only 1 year's worth of $$) but what slaughter  exactly?
1	Tune in to @astrotweeps @elakdawalla @mggtTaylor for the latest news on @ESA_Rosetta's final mission  from the cont… https://t.co/6Qhgty7VvH
1	@michealjroberts this whole argument implicitly agrees that only perm. academic positions give an MSc/PhD value. @NickAstronomer @DrJoVian
1	@NGC3314 Nnnooooooooooooo
-1	@kevinschawinski Perhaps  but the veto was always doomed &amp; a failed veto costs a Pres at home. WH decided the overseas message was worth it.
-1	@kevinschawinski I’m talking about the doomed veto. Its purpose is to let POTUS/WH say to the world that they tried.
-1	@kevinschawinski Nah  this veto is optics.
1	@SuffolkNature @osuc_curator @AndrewNCassidy @morbidflight @galaxyzoo Try https://t.co/R4sEWcnq5N to build a project @the_zooniverse :)
1	@ProfMike_M Seems perfect for @BriefJournal.
1	@jen_gupta though smaller bulges are more likely to be pseudobulges (light less concentrated  more rotationally supported)  if that matters.
1	@jen_gupta no typical  no unrealistic. But if it's a spiral I suppose it should be small enough to see the arms :)
-1	@IBJIYONGI @niais I for one am grateful for you “troublemakers”. But also I felt no pressure whatsoever to sign. @PlanetDr @berkeleyjess
1	@realscientists Unconferences are great! Need to be planned differently though. If not planning program  must carefully choose who attends.
-1	@realscientists Conferences that revolve around acts of fitness: skiing  hiking  etc. - immediately puts disabled people in the “out” crowd.
1	@becky1505 I’m actively bringing @kevinschawinski @NGC3314 @BenneHolwerda into the circle of those who can make you sing Disney songs.
1	@becky1505 PS: Kalamazoo @kevinschawinski @NGC3314 @BenneHolwerda
1	@becky1505 @kevinschawinski @NGC3314 @BenneHolwerda JUST TRY AND STOP ME
1	@kevinschawinski @becky1505 Voorwerpjes? @NGC3314 @BenneHolwerda
1	@kejames Remember that thing where Google put together a bunch of tourism photos over years to see places evolve? I want to see that here!
1	@BenneHolwerda so I'm on the second floor @ snellius- where do I go now?
1	cc @margaretkosmala @AndreaWiggins @alicatzoo because due credit wouldn’t fit in the character limits of that tweet. https://t.co/twGRGcMJJI
1	@Summer_Ash @emilylurice @jegpeek Completely agreed. By “persistently” I definitely meant as a community  not that any 1 person must always.
1	@Summer_Ash @emilylurice @jegpeek (and in the latter case we call out any BS persistently  until it goes away)
1	@Summer_Ash @emilylurice @jegpeek “The Leavitt Space Telescope” - 👍. I think we either stop naming them after people  or women are ok to go.
1	@reneehlozek Unintentionally awesome feedback.
1	@ProfMike_M "laffable" was gold though.
1	@startorialist congrats!
1	Cc @startorialist  https://t.co/k1MEIO0HBj
1	@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @CitizenSciences @Jen_A_Smith1 we see differences between @the_zooniverse project demographics.
1	@erinleeryan @gsnarayan @GeertHub that is odd though  I think that setup has worked for me in the past with transparent PDFs.
1	@erinleeryan @gsnarayan @GeertHub can you save the pdf as png and compile with that? Becomes raster but should preserve alpha.
1	@GeertHub @erinleeryan png?
-1	A composite of images taken by @NASA_Dawn in a low-altitude mapping orbit. https://t.co/v7PaAFbKDV
-1	@gsnarayan @IBJIYONGI + @Yale too  given they have a College named for a slavery advocate &amp; refused to rename it because “confront our past"
1	.@NUCIERA has provided mints for everyone at #FF16CIERA. The mints are caffeinated.
1	Penny: @NASAKepler K2 is capable of detecting free-floating planets; with prompt AO imaging we can tell if they’re bound. #FF16CIERA
1	@ScienceNelson absolutely loved that book.
1	@merrdiff this happened to me too  in CA - it was so long ago I hadn't realized they'd still have the record!
1	@astrokatey I fully agree with your sentiments. Unrelated: I stay up late a lot. &lt;waves north&gt; Also I 💚 the fact that email goes to me.
-1	@kejames YES  THIS. Public proposals always creep me out a bit  and the additional limelight-stealing aspect: double #nope.
1	@PenguinGalaxy wondering if @dalcantonJD's recent course is online anywhere.
1	@jen_gupta did you go with the one that resembles a diffraction grating then?
-1	.@MichielJorissen @realscientists Yeah um maybe we could NOT promote the work of a notorious sexual harasser?
1	@tweetedhere @DrKevGuitar @realscientists I apologize for having not removed your mention.
1	@tweetedhere @DrKevGuitar @realscientists Thanks for going out of your way to tell me we are each responsible for our own reactions.
1	@tweetedhere @DrKevGuitar @realscientists As a female scientist I’ve heard that type of “yet” pretty often. Always well-meaning.
-1	@tweetedhere @DrKevGuitar @realscientists I didn’t think it was meant as an insult. Nor did I think it was about a Hollywood stereotype.
1	@DrKevGuitar @tweetedhere @realscientists “strong yet believable” 😞
1	@kevinschawinski Volvos seem an odd starter choice  but safety first I guess?
1	@astrobellatrix plus routing number  maybe. It's easy to put together and easy for banks to read. There's no excuse.
1	@kevinschawinski @eilatg Those with the t-shirts now exchange wistful looks when they see each other on the street. 👕🐿🍸😀😐😞
1	@kevinschawinski I remember. Back when that show was still awesome.
-1	@kevinschawinski Consider getting an account at my bank. They have no problems *sending* money abroad +they can cash checks with app photos.
-1	@kevinschawinski Maybe the Swiss are trying to force the US to update their system.
-1	@kevinschawinski When this started I was all “the Swiss are banking ninjas  so I’m sure they can navigate the antiquated US system.” #NOPE
1	@kevinschawinski This exemplifies why it’s taking so long for your system and my system to talk to one another.
1	@kevinschawinski Can you still deposit via photos of a check taken from within your banking app?
1	@kevinschawinski @LeoBurtscher #monsters16 There was another paper out recently that claimed similar: Mechtley+. Sample selection important!
1	@drarnakarick of course! I use it all the time &amp; I thought everyone did!
1	@drarnakarick (I pretty much redirect everything through it so I can use that feature all the time)
-1	@drarnakarick gmail undo send?
1	@DrJoVian @StellarPlanet sorry! Didn't mean to cause alarm. Also very glad you're safe :)
1	CARS is doing some really cool stuff with ionisation. Question just now about light travel times for light echoes @astrobellatrix #galpath16
1	.@astrobellatrix is talking about CARS  aka "35 nearby quasars with MUSE" and I haven't even seen one yet and already YESSSSssss #galpath16
1	@astrokatey slightly trolling @becky1505 with a mention because she can get push notifications but currently can't reply mwahahahah
1	@astrokatey non-tethered people around me: nope
1	@npr247 yep  @astrokatey just said they'll be posted soon. Posters too!
1	@astrokatey yay! Thank you!
1	There are rumors that the wifi password has changed - any truth to that @astrokatey @rareflwr41? #galpath16
1	@astrokatey is the conference logo anywhere online? Couldn't find it on the site. Want to feature it in a slide tomorrow! :)
1	@astrokatey so by tweeting that question  I was compounding the issue. Gah! :)
1	So far @becky1505 and I have spotted @astrobellatrix on the ferry to #galpath16 - anyone else? #6am #waytooearly #zzZZzzz
1	.@ProfMike_M @BestGalaxyPics @NUPhotographer hey @twitter  why can't you report a tweet for having stolen content?
1	@internetofshit @kevinschawinski The last time my fridge software froze  it stopped making ice. #puddleofirony
1	@astrobellatrix @astrokatey yay galpath! Also @becky1505 and others :)
1	@realscientists Let’s be a bit careful about implying someone isn’t a real scientist if they aren’t thinking about science 24/7.
1	@GeertHub @jradavenport For some reason this makes me want to keep sending basic code snippets and saying “ta-da! you’re welcome!” 😁🤓😎
1	@GeertHub At some point @jradavenport is going to lose patience and start shouting “I KNOW PANDAS I LOVE PANDAS TOO I ALREADY KNOW” …
-1	@merrdiff So they have a problem with BlackLivesMatter  but not with the idea that black lives matter? Will they at least say the latter?
-1	@merrdiff :( when is an *inappropriate* time for inclusivity? Also that’s not what this would be? It’s life &amp; death  not a party invitation.
1	@jen_gupta There’s really good theater  some good gigs  one of my friends does comedy in LA (@Rontowski).
1	@jen_gupta &amp; the chances of it all being within easy distance of where you stay is low  so pick an interesting neighborhood that’s ~central.
1	@jen_gupta :) There’s actually lots of cool stuff to do in LA but you often have to know where to look/be on mailing lists etc
1	@jen_gupta Leave LA?  No  seriously.  *sigh*  okay. Santa Monica? If you like that whole “beach” thing  or that “walkable town” thing...
1	@NGC3314 It’s an ESO survey - well spotted! Think I may have got the galactic center in one of them but not sure (not directly on center).
1	@DrMRFrancis @PlanetDr It uses more characters  though. We @the_zooniverse use “speaking of the Pope” (even when it’s not about the Pope).
1	@kevinschawinski yep  when I was in the UK. You’re now in a much better time zone to organize it than I… @cfroning @astronomolly @owning_ivy
1	@merrdiff @AstroKatie @planet4589 I guess that would have been clear as soon as they got the signal - sorry for asking instead of waiting :)
1	@AstroKatie @planet4589 @merrdiff right - so by “realtime” they mean earth time  not Jupiter time?
1	@GeertHub I nominate @GeertHub to fix it #wikipedia #anyonecanedit
1	@realscientists I always get “The moving walkway is now ending. Please  look down.” stuck in my head after going through it.
1	@realscientists If you’re in C  does that mean you got to go through the new-age-from-1990 tunnel?
1	@realscientists Tortas Fronteras - good margaritas &amp; food! In B or E  I believe.
1	@jr_pritchard @sarahkendrew @BenneHolwerda Planning to tread water for up to 5 years: not the best sign for a party’s strength and backbone.
1	@BenneHolwerda I’m having trouble with this myself. Best guess right now: they were already on the verge &amp; Brexit was a tipping point.
1	@jen_gupta @RASNAM2016 Is that like the analog version of this? https://t.co/7hz2GwaFR2 #NAM2016
1	@BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @grobertsborsani congrats!
1	@eilatg @kevinschawinski @acooray @KnudJahnke Definitely. My panel strongly felt it was a really good start though.
1	@kevinschawinski What is the point of this comment? It’s deeply unhelpful  especially as we don’t yet have proper stats.@knudjahnke @acooray
-1	@acooray I think that’s something the HST TAC organizers would really really want flagged. Raise hell so it won’t happen again. @KnudJahnke
1	@eilatg @kevinschawinski @acooray @KnudJahnke PIs are allowed to reveal themselves - but panels shouldn’t guess (PI or gender).
-1	@kevinschawinski @acooray @knudjahnke No  it didn’t backfire - it was generally really well received. That panel behaved badly. Most didn’t.
1	@eilatg They weren’t. And panelists were expressly told to NOT try to guess. @kevinschawinski @acooray @KnudJahnke
1	@kevinschawinski Umm yep I take my previous tweet back. At least in some small part.
1	@PenguinGalaxy *hug* I’m really sorry.
-1	@orbitingfrog thank f*ck. @aagie @becky1505  PS miss you  sad I’m not there to say hi :)
1	@aagie @orbitingfrog in a jacket and tie?!?  Please tell me this is only for dinner in hall. Otherwise you will crush my non-corporate soul.
1	@NGC3314 “Kinda”? You okay? ;) @radiogalaxyzoo @owning_ivy
1	@aagie @dotastronomy looks like Tuesday is punting weather!
1	@dustchick @Meg_Urry @MartinHajovsky I realise I'm in a glass house here. We call galaxies luminous  ultra-luminous  hyper-luminous… #aas228
1	Came across these while decluttering my inbox between #aas228 sessions @startorialist https://t.co/5zPRbGp5LD https://t.co/h5FYfOzVx5
1	The community makes @galaxyzoo. Shoutout to the moderators &amp; collaborators  including @hannyvanarkel @PenguinGalaxy #aas228
1	@merrdiff sadly I already purchased some  like a chump. (Also the FRB talk is excellent.)
1	@merrdiff Now scheming to acquire a press badge.
1	@merrdiff Absolutely! ...there's coffee in the press room?
1	@merrdiff the Starbucks downstairs was deserted. Odd.
1	@ProfMike_M @chrislintott if that were a stronger effect with increasing redshift I suspect it would make theorists happy.
-1	@chrislintott @merrdiff oh hang on  there is a mic  but it hasn't been used so far.
1	@aussiastronomer @PlanSciCRichey I’m still updating it! I figured this would be spammy on the hashtag so I’m doing it early :)
1	@kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters I believe it was also never really meant to shift much beyond z ~ 1 so an update would be excellent.
1	Morphological quenching of a 4-armed bulged spiral  via @NGC3314 https://t.co/HmnP0J3qb9
1	@nhuntwalker @niais @IBJIYONGI Except there was that one time when it was Lupus.
-1	@NGC3314 I wonder if they think it’s also a deterrent? That’s the same advice as in the video. Active instruction to attack in self-defense.
1	@ProfMike_M It was. Luckily all digits still intact.
-1	@kevinschawinski it’s okay. I don’t actually watch GoT… yet I know about many of the characters who die  and in what order. #thanksinterwebz
1	@kevinschawinski #missingspoilerwarning
-1	@aallan @sarahkendrew Ugh  I haven’t started this yet. But I have started making new notes in my private research blog instead of EN.
-1	@jen_gupta I suspect @chrislintott  just wants more excuses to visit Tucson.
1	@GeertHub @sarahkendrew @markmccaughrean San Diego was 16C and rainy this morning too. People were wearing winter coats  scarves  knit hats.
1	@CitSciAssoc Of course! It’s an important issue and the more member feedback  the better.
1	Also weigh in on whether the next @CitSciAssoc meeting should be in N. Carolina https://t.co/BEWdqYtBmH #transrights https://t.co/71NAePkDBC
1	@jen_gupta nice paper! :)
1	@GeertHub wow  that tweet is disturbing without context! :) congrats @exoplaneteer!!
1	@Blackprojects there are definitely blank images in there - we're working on removing them. Marking them is still useful though - thanks
1	@chrisenorth @boomerang I find it is. I've been using it for a year or so and it's great.
1	@kevinschawinski You’re trying to drink a pink-colored wine outside of Provence and expecting anything other than syrup?
1	@Enceladosaurus I believe Ron Buta gave a talk on this today at U. Alabama! @NGC3314 knows more :)
1	@raminskibba @kevinschawinski We’ll see what happens when they start releasing the details of the Americans named in the papers.
-1	@kevinschawinski @raminskibba They threw eggs and yogurt at his window. As if to say “here’s breakfast  now GTFO you lying sleaze."
-1	@reneehlozek I felt ashamed to be a @Princeton alum when I read this. “We’ll be super diverse from now on  honest!” is nowhere near enough.
1	@Enceladosaurus @PeterDEdmonds I found it useful to hold on to that possibility. You never know. Or  you may find another source of joy!
-1	@reneehlozek :( Hope you got plenty of free flight coupons (and booze) for your trouble!
1	@jen_gupta Or we don’t tweet enough...
1	@shaka_lulu Glad you “ranted”. I didn’t know about @instacart before this &amp; now I wish such a thing existed that *wasn’t* exploitative.
1	@ProfMike_M @girlandkat @JointSpaceOps @SpaceTrackOrg I'm hoping without cause that today's reputation as a day of resurrection holds.
1	@kevinschawinski Uh  and then in the next breath that guy gives a voice to a misogynist troll by inviting him on to interview.
1	@NGC3314 I’m a night owl so I don’t mind staying up to observe :) but yes  summer outreach observing is always a challenge.
1	@chrisenorth @arfon At least  that’s the myth.
1	@chrisenorth @arfon Wasn’t it Linus Torvalds jokingly naming it after himself? https://t.co/42tyUJorQA
1	@kevinschawinski (going back to your question right after the #LIGO press conference)
-1	@kevinschawinski our #LIGO speaker argued BH mergers &gt;&gt; NS mergers for a GW Nobel because NSs aren’t strong enough gravity for a pure test.
1	@kevinschawinski Strangely enough  not an option on the security question dropdown list. Nor cherry earl grey.
1	@kevinschawinski You’ve been ruined by a snarky pair of astronomers who keep adorable pet rats and give away the best artisanal stuff.
1	@kevinschawinski #icecreamtrolling
-1	@astronomyblog I sort of wish they had. I can just imagine what the drop-down choices for answers would be (no free-form answers allowed).
1	@astronomyblog The reason “what’s your ideal first date?” wasn’t on the list is that I’d already chosen it for question #3.
1	@paulcoxon @iamscicomm Thank you! :)
-1	@chrisenorth I’m not emoji-hip either! Was aiming for “ooh  burn… also you’re totally right &lt;should be sheepish but actually unapologetic&gt;"
1	@chrisenorth 🔥🔥💥😏
1	@chrisenorth INDEED. But at this point if I could manage a few hours clear of e-mail microdistractions I’d consider it progress.
1	@megschwamb Awesome! Congrats! @GeminiObs  is lucky to have you :)
1	@BenneHolwerda @dalcantonJD Maybe it’s El Cap only? Hmm.
1	@shaka_lulu @AaronKappel has some really good articles on @ESTBLSHMNT @HuffingtonPost and elsewhere. Good place to start maybe?
1	@kevinschawinski @astrobellatrix @eilatg Bit of a strange list though; e.g. @ezetre+2012’s point is to bring many of these studies together.
1	@kevinschawinski There was an AAS talk about this in January  I think. Very cool! @chandraxray @galaxyzoo
1	@kevinschawinski Bit like this  but with sharks? https://t.co/r1JmKC6zsW @the_zooniverse @kwwillett
1	@realscientists @KarenLMasters @gravinpetra Education &amp; Public Outreach
1	@realscientists @gravinpetra @KarenLMasters your assessment or your field’s? There’s some evidence those who blog do more science  not less.
1	@ehafen Really interesting chat. Talked with @kevinschawinski later about balancing agility with security+privacy infrastructure building.
1	@KarinaVoggel @kevinschawinski @claudiacicone @bennytr Buoyed by a tart that was less a baked good and more a delivery system for schnapps.
1	Apparently fondue isn’t authentic Zürich; nevertheless @kevinschawinski @claudiacicone @bennytr and I just ate all the cheese in the canton.
1	@shaka_lulu @dalcantonJD @jradavenport if seminar/talk Q&amp;A style is always “pokey” but rest of dept experience is nurturing  is that okay?
1	@mggtTaylor @sallyemmacooper @Dr_Lucie @jodcast It was so much fun! Science + sciComm + enough sleep to survive = #winning
1	Listen only because @mggtTaylor @sallyemmacooper @Dr_Lucie are brilliant  not for my sleep-deprived ramblings. https://t.co/AQTARylGux
-1	@vrooje @SAOImageDS9 @Jeyhan @merrdiff Huh  weird  maybe it was that. Changed pref  from “Damaged  will not open” to “you sure?” And opened!
1	@merrdiff @Jeyhan @SAOImageDS9  from memory with my previous laptop  region files from one version of DS9 weren't compatible with another.
1	@SAOImageDS9 @Jeyhan @merrdiff It wasn’t that - option key gets around that already. It said the file was damaged.
1	@Jeyhan thank you! Had to go back to the Snow Leopard archive but it opened and loaded a file without crashing. :) @merrdiff @SAOImageDS9
1	@Jeyhan @merrdiff I remember doing that on my previous laptop! Do you have a version number that works?  Also ccing @SAOImageDS9
1	@merrdiff Alas  my new laptop came with it… but I have the X-win version it in a custom software folder. Took 3 mins to open  then hung. &gt;_&gt;
1	@jen_gupta @KarenLMasters @portsmouthuni  Yay  flyers!  I was sort of stunned we’d never had any before.
1	@PeterDEdmonds Mathematician  though as far as I can tell no current academic affiliation. Seems to have been really something 10 years ago.
-1	@kevinschawinski Indeed  this does seem to be a grudge based on reading other tweets. Not the first time he’s been problematic.
1	@ProfMike_M Interesting. And nurses don’t feature in the UK poll. Thank you! (apologies for my google failure.)
1	@jen_gupta  a) awesome b) super awesome c) totally the awesomest
1	I’m particularly enjoying reading @realscientists this week! Mainly because #cheetahs + #science = #WIN. https://t.co/KoNK8VAeBw
1	An interactive version of periodic origins here: https://t.co/MGgIGQpXAd from @astronomyblog @chrisenorth  https://t.co/HEaNuElK8K
1	@jen_gupta Sometimes they’re telling me because they want to know how legit it is. I point out most objects have multiple names  so it’s ok.
1	@sarahkendrew @e_astronomer @Authorea? (I mostly use @GitHub.)
1	@chrisenorth @chrislintott Is there any reason they’d build it really asymmetrically so as to reproduce the observed light curve?
1	@chrisenorth We’ve also discussed how to put an upper limit on it based on assumptions that it’s intrinsically a normal (or bright?) F3.
1	@jegpeek @chrislintott @Astro_Wright and @tsboyajian
1	@chrisenorth @chrislintott ah wait  I see what you mean :)
1	@chrisenorth @chrislintott (so linear is probably reasonable on average over 1/14th the total build time)
1	@chrisenorth @chrislintott assuming occultation of flux in erg/s/cm^2 is really construction in m^2/time  right?
1	@chrisenorth @chrislintott if [Delta flux represented by 15% this century] is constant  why do we need to know where we are in the build?
1	@chrisenorth @chrislintott Does it require that starting date? Requires assumption of same rate overall.
1	@chrislintott @chrisenorth It’s like 1400 years  right? 700 for the side facing us…
-1	Speaking of known harassers  why is @BlackPhysicists willing to be listed as a partner at https://t.co/Ys9v5xCEWA ? https://t.co/Mt9ZkFFk0b
-1	@reneehlozek or “I take responsibility for learning how to never do harm again”. @orzelc @dalcantonJD
1	@UltraSteveG I’m guessing that’s a harmonic - have you flagged it in Talk? Thanks for classifying! @PulsarHunters @BBCStargazing
1	@astronomyblog *hugs*  It’s okay to feel like a mess.  Also I know external validation is not the point  but you are so  so valued.  *hugs*
1	@kevinschawinski the conference centre was fine. And it wasn't too hard to leave the hotel for more affordable food. Still soulless  though.
1	@astrobellatrix Yes  there was scatter - also it was a specifically selected sample so that may have helped things along...
-1	@astrobellatrix It was one of those 5-minute talks and I missed how she calculated AGN Mdot  but it was SFR:Mdot ratio.
1	@kwwillett @ProfMike_M standard answer to title-as-question is "No". Provocative.
1	.@ProfMike_M cautions there's still work to do with dynamical models of bulges &amp; disks - this work is the start. A very good start. #aas227
-1	Using just B/Tot ratios as a constraint  @ProfMike_M kinematically separates bulges and disks &amp; they seem "astrophysically plausible"#aas227
-1	.@ProfMike_M is updating #aas227 on spectral decompositions of bulges and disks in @MaNGASurvey. SF in S0s is in bulges  not the disks.
1	@NGC3314 that must have been... Slow.
1	@davecl42 @ESAHerschel I missed the full data description while in tweet composition mode - definitely ask Lewis? This is a great talk.
1	@asymbina I love (and hate the truth in) this description. @see_the_sky @Enceladosaurus
1	@ProfMike_M Should be fun.
1	@chrisenorth I interpreted it as a sign of +1 excitement and fatigue. :) Congrats!
1	@astrobellatrix @eilatg #arrrrrrghyemateys
1	@jradavenport @qobilidop @merrdiff @sarahkendrew @BenneHolwerda @NGC3314 @dunkenj Thank you for all the help! Going w/ conda +separate IRAF.
1	@NGC3314 @BenneHolwerda I use IRAF so much less frequently than Python … hmm.
1	@BenneHolwerda Because PyRAF?
1	@BenneHolwerda Occasionally.
-1	@jradavenport @nhuntwalker @dalcantonJD @astrokiwi @reneehlozek @mcnees Sadly our diverse campus center only seems to have a BK for burgers.
-1	@dalcantonJD @astrokiwi @reneehlozek @nhuntwalker @jradavenport @mcnees Also this is an evil conversation to have pre-lunch #WestCoast
1	@astrokiwi @nhuntwalker @dalcantonJD @reneehlozek @jradavenport @mcnees Not sure there’s a more perfect burger than In n Out animal style.

-1	@CoopSciScoop @Astro_JohnCF @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters Note: FotW wasn’t rejected because of a "definition of citizen science” issue.
-1	@CoopSciScoop @Astro_JohnCF @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters I suspect it will go ahead on the Zooniverse platform as an independent project.
1	@CoopSciScoop @Astro_JohnCF @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters Is this the Faces of the World project?
1	@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters Really? Hah!
1	@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters That’s a good point.
1	@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters The term just flags “the public is involved at some level above a BOINC”  but that’s all.
1	@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters I’m definitely not saying *don’t* use the term. But the actual content is in the details.
1	@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters It’s a bit like saying “the NSF should fund me because I’m a scientist doing science."
1	@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters I’m making the point that for practical justifications like that  it’s too broad.
1	@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters Sure. This sub-thread is a response to use of “citizen science” in proposals as justification.
-1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters We’re not actually disagreeing  you know.
-1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters There’s no single agreed definition  not even about core points  and that’s another problem.
1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters My point is: you do have a definition &amp; not everything counts by it. And that’s okay.
1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters I agree. But I saw posters at the CSA meeting in San Jose that wouldn’t.
1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters New knowledge: my friend and I now know the pH of her pool. And maybe more about pH.
1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters Okay. Does it count as research if there’s no intent to publish?
1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters By some definitions  measuring my friend’s pool chemistry w/her counts as citizen science.
-1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters Either everything counts that claims to count  or you discriminate. When is it artificial?
-1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters Define “artificially”? If the alternative is dilution to the point of meaninglessness…
1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters How do we reconcile all those definitions? Who decides what counts as citizen science?
1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters Thing is  so many different things are called “citizen science” it’s not a useful shorthand.
1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters I find it useful to separate practical reasons from fundamental reasons for using the term.
1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters so… it *is* about separating citizen scientists from other scientists?
1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters I’m not against the term citizen science/scientist. I just don’t think it’s The One Term.
1	@kevinschawinski @coopsciscoop @karenlmasters Great  so why suggest everyone should use a single term?
-1	@CoopSciScoop @kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters We should ask them; for me  it’s problematic in how othering it is. Why not “collaborators”?
1	@kevinschawinski @karenlmasters @coopsciscoop “Minority”: should we go by person count or effort count? In the latter they’re the majority.
-1	@kevinschawinski @KarenLMasters @CoopSciScoop Even though some of our most engaged volunteers a) blur boundaries  and b) hate the term?
-1	@NGC3314 @KarenLMasters @CoopSciScoop I think highlighting it could come across as gimmicky/distracting. Doesn’t help convince skeptics.
1	@dalcantonJD @lukedones Dehumanization of citizens by police officers should be against police culture; instead it seems it’s encouraged.
1	@dalcantonJD @lukedones YES. Inexcusable. Over and over  lives shattered. Here  they did it when the paramedics were looking for her too?!
1	@dalcantonJD @lukedones And the part on the gofundme site about him cutting off their wifi “so they’ll want to move”.
-1	@dalcantonJD @lukedones Obviously this isn’t the worst part of any story with a tragic death in it  but this person is despicable. Rage.
1	@GeertHub They’re only comfortable for the rare sub-species of leaning-people (pictured).
1	@Seplute @PenguinGalaxy There’s the “Meta” category at https://t.co/RtXxlpXvnc &amp; generally @mrniaboc keeps track of @the_zooniverse surveys.
1	@JohnRSports @cosmobiologist I am getting too mold for this.
1	@c0nc0rdance Thanks for the paper! They must be in the water once the water hits the pool  after its cooled a little bit.

-1	@JohnRSports No  John. Rather: With hopes for the absence of sorrow (#Istanbul). Bing is on top of its game as usual.
1	@biyolokum @JohnRSports @istemfer Bonus: she is out in the field right now hunting trees! Thank you  again  Istem &amp; Duygu ❤️
1	@JohnRSports Indeed! @biyolokum is the brains/heart behind that operation. Cheers  -B.
1	@c0nc0rdance This helps a lot! Thank you very much  DNA!
1	@c0nc0rdance Did you use the Jitterbug continuously? I want it to last as long as the experiment does  and it is a long experiment!
-1	@c0nc0rdance the orbit for the current shaker I have is 3mm  the larger shaker has a 25mm orbit. shaking: 250rpm (former)  90 rpm (latter).
1	@c0nc0rdance Correct. App: Experimental evolution -- exploring the benchtop incubator options (alternative is a T controlled room).
1	@c0nc0rdance Been using VWR's but observing too much variability inside the "controlled volume" of the equipment.
-1	@c0nc0rdance How about using a generic benchtop incubator shaker with microplate adapters? I wonder if that would be a sustainable option.
1	@JohnRSports Thank you  John!
1	@___MissFisher Merhaba Gizem. Karabuk konusmam e-konferans olacak. Gelecek uc boyutlu konusmalarimi buradan duyururum elbette. Tesekkurler.
1	@DownHereOnEarth  I say change the world by being who you are. It won't be easy  but it will be worth it!
1	@fedkukso Federico  you asked me a very similar question the other day. You should meet @thisischristina  if you haven't already!
1	@JohnRSports Hi John. It will be broadcasted online through various channels. Happy to share it with you when it is available.
1	@cosmobiologist @ScienceAlert This is great! Thanks Graham.
1	@mcanseverrr @JohnRSports I suppose Bing will translate your suggestion into "say is Mohammed plug in weakness happy url?"
1	@JohnRSports Hey @bing  how do you explain this bazaar translation? What kind of algorithm will insert a proper noun where there is none?
-1	@betulland @JohnRSports Yet another reason why Bing sucks. Compare with the Google Translation  not even close. https://t.co/EFQnr9emUN
1	@JohnRSports Wow. Very true It is good that #Falcon9 is not a race horse!
1	@betulland @CafeSciBoston @LeLabCambridge @novapbs @NovaCafe Thank you!
1	@JohnRSports Sounds good. Feel free to email me if that does not work. Cheers  -Betul
1	@JohnRSports Hi John  I provided the citation. Please let me know if you do not have access  happy to share via email. Best  -Betul
1	@JohnRSports Indeed :) I was referring to the availability of a recent preprint on the reconstruction of ancestral genes  not "alex" genes!

1	@mikeduncan ok @kevinschawinski now I reeeally want to know what the deleted tweet is!!
-1	@JohnDebes it didn't mean to  it was jsut having a bad day
1	@JohnDebes ?
1	@dalcantonJD @astronomeara truth: every time i'm on a telecon w/ @brant_robertson i wonder how many ppl would get "they're good dogs  brent"
1	@aussiastronomer who is Ursula in this version ?
1	@JasonKalirai congrats!!!!!
1	@astronomeara not my job

1	@PlanetDr 📝📝📝
1	@PlanetDr 👏👏👍👍
1	@JasonKalirai was wondering what's been going on in there
1	@njgoldbaum that's ok.
1	@mcnees this was my rubber stamp on fb today
1	@kejames not the implosion I was expecting today 😒
-1	@PlanetDr it kind of broke my mind. Same company  same car  same overnight parking situation.
-1	Gonna miss you  @SenatorBarb https://t.co/xpWEaQVL3k
1	@kevinschawinski unconvinced that would actually help the people
1	@kejames i just finished "dark forest" and it was more uplifting
-1	@astraughnomer #jealous
1	@aussiastronomer tho honestly ... I think whichever way this goes that'll be the outcome on this one
1	@aussiastronomer ding ding ding
1	@AllPlanets @NASAKepler wow. That picture. Wow.
1	@DrRubidium ❤️
1	@demitrimuna i ate them all
1	@JohnDebes ouch  best part: googling his name now suggests "aliens"
-1	@reneehlozek i first read that as "a man at a party literally once chided..."  which also works.
1	@astronomeara @dalcantonJD i lol'd
-1	@kejames yeah. I was there the first week of July and it was incredible how cheap everything felt
1	@mcnees yeah
1	@KirkDBorne thanks for advertising! it's a (fairly) new fellowship  so takes effort to get the word out
1	@PlanetDr member of janitorial staff who's been on medical leave for several months
1	@b3ko it is. This is that program  a "monitor"
1	@b3ko so that these variations can robustly be calibrated out for real data (i.e. Make the field "flat")
-1	@b3ko it's a crap abstract :) using a calibration lamp to uniformly illuminate the detector to see what variations there are on detector
1	@njgoldbaum it is :)
1	@njgoldbaum what fraction of your time is spent answering python questions?
1	@JohnDebes @dstndstn galaxies are debris disks that just got out of hand amirite

-1	@benjaminsharkey gotta admit  as an alum  this hurts
-1	@DrMRFrancis :'(
1	@jessicaesquire @DrMRFrancis this is exactly why I'm forcing myself to watch the debate tonight: complacency prevention
1	@DrMRFrancis @jessicaesquire imagine 4 years tho.
1	@astronomeara https://t.co/3nRGxlET8Z
1	@brendonbrewer both simultaneously. if I feel I can't advocate at all  I won't agree to write
1	@carylgronwall great talk from Lea today btw
1	@BeckePhysics @BenLillie exactly!
-1	@BenLillie @BeckePhysics Sure  &amp; I'm not disagreeing with that  but much of the misunderstanding of what science *is* is baked in in school
1	@astronomeara good times  now to finish up the galaxy catalog.....................
1	@MJIBrown @rcrain_astro @KarenLMasters (@kevinschawinski's "model" that inner CGM of red spirals should be dif from red Es had us excited)
1	@MJIBrown @rcrain_astro @KarenLMasters brighter than about 19mag in FUV (galex  AB). 19.5 is really pushing it. Very few QSOs this bright.
1	@MJIBrown @rcrain_astro @KarenLMasters @amelia_fmc @RossEHart yep. Bright enough to be obs'd w COS in reasonable time  &lt; 50 kpc proj
1	@MJIBrown @rcrain_astro @KarenLMasters @amelia_fmc @RossEHart not enough UV bright QSOs. We looked.
1	@MJIBrown @rcrain_astro oh hey I know that plot
1	@Quasilocal @astronomeara @lumenphosphor yeah.....no.
1	@aussiastronomer yay Elodie!!
1	@Quasilocal @astronomeara @lumenphosphor please tell me that's a typo
1	@MJIBrown 😒
1	@rachelosten software is necessary but not sufficient
1	@BenneHolwerda @PenguinGalaxy it's hard to find...i got my copy at a used bookstore in Wellington. ST's library didn't even have a copy

1	@sondy yowch
1	@iva_momcheva @eteq @LouisStrolger @demitrimuna great minds https://t.co/XNtwBS9CpR
1	@demitrimuna @astrogrant @eteq I admit to being mildly amused at your recent postings Demitri  given that this was in the works
1	@Harcel @njgoldbaum @eteq @stsci exactly that :)
1	@brettmor @eteq what  emoji on Twitter isn't enough detail for you? 😎
1	@njgoldbaum @eteq nope  internal @stsci funds of awesome
1	@eteq @LouisStrolger sooooooo can we tell everyone yet how you're solving Pythonastronomy etc
1	@JohnDebes and probably some of this week's deadlines.........
1	@JohnDebes @sarahkendrew 1.7" in Fed Hill before 7am.
1	@npr247 @kevinschawinski good to see you were paying attention :)
1	@DrMRFrancis (november?)
1	@DrMRFrancis yaaaasssssss
-1	@astronomeara your being on an airplane today came up in a skype convo  this morning  you'll be shocked to discover
1	@SCTrager @michael_w_busch @astrotweeps note the red Line under the 0.3 :)
1	@DrRubidium up 3% in the last  4 years
1	@astrotweeps which maybe they should advertise more.....  (My 1st encounter w NSF was as a panelist and I had no idea what was going on)
1	@astrotweeps oooooh it's super obvious from this end!: "stay on the PO's good side"
1	@astronomeara 🌮
1	@astronomeara 🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮
1	@kevinschawinski starting??
1	@astrotweeps @DrMRFrancis so points to your student for having calendar pop ups!
1	@gravitate_to_me more surprised than anything else...hadn't thought I could become one of "those" people. Still not really I guess.
1	@BenneHolwerda three guesses of my current location :)
-1	@jegpeek only reason not an A+ is because of lack of oxford comma tbh
1	@jegpeek @BenneHolwerda @conselice cc @gfsnyder
1	@erinleeryan @JohnDebes just checked and apparently me too  don't know for how long it's been though
1	@realscientists ....the early scientist gets the bird?
1	@Summer_Ash I hear you're responsible for this? ❤️❤️🌈🌈 cc @jegpeek https://t.co/93WXwUtr5G
1	@astrotweeps I'd be flabbergasted if anyone following astrotweeps is not also following @AstroKatie!
1	@DrRubidium s/grading and grant writing/review article writing/ and yeah.
-1	@ProfMike_M @deborahblum It's also...as a resident of Baltimore....I find sensationalism of these kinds of headlines to be almost dangerous
1	@realscientists NOT A BIRD
1	If you like birds or at least pictures of birds check out @realscientists now https://t.co/Sgy3FWXCew
1	@njgoldbaum 300 to 550.
1	@BenneHolwerda @SCTrager @drannawatts the grocery store as in life
1	@josh_sokol it's like you and @jegpeek are the same person
1	@jegpeek https://t.co/6x2LYsctyN
1	@jegpeek what I don't get: WHY CAN'T THEY JUST READ THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE
1	@jegpeek but here's the thing: if the SCHOOLS can't afford A/C  heat....what makes them think kids will be better AT HOME?
1	@astrotweeps @dalcantonJD our group uses the Paper app a lot. Just finger or stylus tho
-1	@astro_jje @JohnDebes even worse: a BALTIMORE accent =-o
1	@astro_jje @JohnDebes do it do it do it
1	@jegpeek @AnnFinkbeiner same webcast link
1	@astrokatey a rocket to launch it into space
1	@JohnDebes @astro_jje bonus: baltimore's housing marking is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy less whack than auckland's
1	@telescoper @sarahkendrew @jegpeek so not dull. the fun doesn't stop for those pesky summer months!
-1	@astrotweeps @biotweeps totally using #fighttheavocado as a #worklifebalance hashtag now
1	@PlanetDr I'm really glad I decided the laundry could wait 15 minutes
1	@jegpeek @aprilfollies "actually"
1	@astraughnomer @astronomeara @Summer_Ash @shannonmstirone OK  now highly amused--- I hadn't seen these tweets when I linked earlier today!
1	@AstroKatie @mcnees what i &lt;3 re this story is all day my feed has been full of "no we did not find aliens" which out of context = awesome
1	@hubbahubble https://t.co/IwEtO0oxel
1	@DrRubidium A+
1	@SCTrager @Harcel @BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 but the "e" in "ear" and "best" are different
1	@SCTrager @Harcel @BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 "ear......p"
1	@Harcel @BenneHolwerda @mattkenworthy @jabberjabber0 I can't even make that sound in my head
1	@BenneHolwerda it's less than a year old. iphone 6s.
1	@aussiastronomer @dalcantonJD @AnnFinkbeiner maybe i shoudl have let it go through the spin cycle
1	@aussiastronomer @dalcantonJD @AnnFinkbeiner but mine was a good 20m in the rinse cycle
1	@aussiastronomer @dalcantonJD @AnnFinkbeiner ( i remember something like this when researching when my dad's phone drowned)
1	@aussiastronomer @dalcantonJD @AnnFinkbeiner my theory is it doesn't help compared to say  just leaving it be.
1	@planettvguide @arielwaldman i now suddently care about prox b!
1	@TCNoel @SciTriGrrl @DrNeilTyson yeah. when i first saw someone tweet it this morning i was super pleasantly surprised &amp; then was like  oh.
-1	@TCNoel @SciTriGrrl @DrNeilTyson too bad it's not  actually  you know  NdGT
1	@astronomeara so btw: favorite papers talking about elemental abundances ratios in cgm/igm? email me?
1	@astronomeara (funny part being that with July = Phase II month  conferences for me in summer actually kind of hard)
1	@astronomeara teaching  schmeaching
1	@astronomeara I like this idea

1	@NGC3314 hey @erinleeryan you seen any cakes recently
1	@NGC3314 gonna laugh so hard if it discovers it doesn't exist
1	@bjmclaughlin I *think* it uses the same info as populates https://t.co/hINe1cqaGw but I'm not 100% sure
1	@bjmclaughlin (the account just went live about 36? hours ago  which is why you haven't heard about it before...)
1	@bjmclaughlin straight from the source! @STScI schedules @HubbleTelescope observations  so that schedule is scraped and livetweeted!
1	Telecon time. @astronomeara currently in the lead for "best Skype status". https://t.co/3m6XZI2Ue5
1	@Jos_de_Bruijne @BenneHolwerda  but @ESAGaia could do the "here's a ground-based snapshot of the field" thing.....

1	@arielwaldman similar but different  have you seen @planettvguide?
1	@BenneHolwerda @erinleeryan @SCTrager lolololololol

1	@mcnees given that it had 2 followers before I started following &amp; advertising it....I now take all the credit for its followership :)
1	@BenneHolwerda @SCTrager let's discuss how walking outside and thinking you just walked into a wall feels.
-1	@SCTrager @BenneHolwerda define "brutal"
1	@BenneHolwerda here  this week is finally nice and cool after ridonkeylously hot last week
1	@BenneHolwerda aaahhhh
1	The little divots that deviate from smooth spectrum are bc trace amts of heavy elements in the "atmosphere". Ask @JohnDebes for more info :)
1	@BenneHolwerda ?
-1	@BenneHolwerda :(
-1	@BioInFocus @sondy ironically  if the target audience was already on twitter...
1	@MJIBrown *looks at clock and checks arxiv*

1	@xuhulk @roseveleth @antichrista cc @sondy
1	@kevinschawinski @hubble_live @hubbletelescope @ngc3314 yes. a summer intern set it up  more details to come.
1	@BenneHolwerda show off
1	@JohnDebes whereby "awesome" you mean "terrifying"
-1	@JohnDebes or vomiting  given the subject matter
-1	@JohnDebes @HistoryInPics @deltacarina would not put up with that shit  Being in a car fucks w/ their equilibrium enough  zero-g just cruel
1	Yaaaay!!! @astro_jje is hosting @astrotweeps this week! From New Zealand  where it's already the FUTURE 😳 https://t.co/8fOjQ5DdyH

1	@erinleeryan @JohnDebes give me SOME credit...I have plenty of hard cider  Scotch  and mezcal in here to see me through
1	@DrMRFrancis so it's good to see non-louisiana people bringing attention
1	@DrMRFrancis I have a friend (who posts on fb a lot  too) who's running one of the shelters in Baton Rouge. + brother's brother lives in BR
1	@DrMRFrancis i'm really glad this is actually getting coverage. South Carolina is still recovering from floods 11mo ago  but no one cared
-1	@NGC3314 @janerrigby ...what's sad is i know the song well enough it's now playing in my head.

-1	@jeff_foust @PlanetDr I can confirm it's awful out there
1	@McMillan_Astro @astrotweeps @LMHowes maybe we are talking about different stars
1	@jegpeek @dstndstn @astrotweeps given that oxygen is the most abundant metal?
1	@astrotweeps yep. my point is just that iron isn't the only metal :)
-1	@astrotweeps except that  by MASS of metals  the CEMP stars are actually not extremely metal-poor. Just IRON-poor.
1	@jbprime @MBKplus @bigticketdw @cooperUCI JAMES don't you know that if the title is a question the answer is NO ?!
1	@sondy cc @MAST_News
1	@jegpeek @SaraOgaz42 amen amen amen
1	@DrMRFrancis yep
1	@EthonRaptor @corbett gonna guess an igloo at the South Pole doesn't need a fridge
1	@hubbahubble @justincely @willowdower but RIAs are broad: some straight out of college  some have had multiple postdocs
1	@hubbahubble @justincely @willowdower yes  i believe so? Justin can speak to software branch jobs better than I can.
1	@hubbahubble @justincely @willowdower ST is chock full of "alternate" career paths :)
1	@hubbahubble i haven't a clue! but if she's willing to relocate....
1	@hubbahubble also see @STScI past tweets for screenshots of past postings
1	@hubbahubble @justincely @willowdower keep an eye on the job listing site (&amp; follow @STScI). new postings all the time!
1	@hubbahubble common for RIAs to go to grad school in astro. e.g.  @m_j_durbin is starting at UW this fall after working on (iirc) WFC3 team
1	@hubbahubble RIA = research instrument analyst. https://t.co/segmdqZKpV many hires all the time  not current an ad out  but likely soon
1	@hubbahubble RIA is most obvious. also exist lots of software jobs  e.g.  https://t.co/09uh4H5OoE (cc @justincely  @willowdower)
1	@hubbahubble ---can use CS skills  possibly get into research  see if astro grad school is for her  or other route 2/2
1	@hubbahubble depends on what kind of job she's interested in! though sounds perfect for one of many @STScI jobs--- 1/2
1	@mcnees looks kind of like a planetary microlensing lightcurve
1	@DrRubidium Again.
1	@kevinschawinski TV not there yet  just to exoplanets. Cc @planettvguide
1	@jegpeek @jason__rhodes rename after launch?
1	@astrotweeps sub-grid models all the way down
1	@PlanetDr  was there a solution or do i just go make dinner and hope @NBCOlympics can get their shit together?
1	@PlanetDr @NBCOlympics best part is it looks like it does when there IS video but it can be fast-forwarded. but no  no no.
-1	@PlanetDr @NBCOlympics it's beyond awful. and I WOULDN'T HAVE TO WATCH IT IF THE SITE STAYED ON THE WEB ADDRESS I'M AT
-1	.@PlanetDr @NBCOlympics BUT NO! I cant even get the goddamn EXISTING VIDEO to JUST PLAY without redirecting to the GODAWFUL "daily dismount"
1	@PlanetDr @NBCOlympics I literally closed all my devices and had it streaming. Opening Japanese floor routine  planned for 3 hrs of awesome.
1	@marshallperrin @jegpeek @pkgw @JohnDebes @Iguananaut scientists who muck up code ...
1	@willowdower @jegpeek @JohnDebes @pkgw @Iguananaut @marshallperrin INS lacks software developers per se-- lots done  but not as a job title
1	@jegpeek @pkgw cc @justincely
1	@aussiastronomer eek!
1	@astrotweeps or all that mattered was once they formed their first stars!
1	@astrotweeps I loathe the phrase "galaxy formation". as if galaxies ever stop forming!!
1	@mirikramer space can wait. just ask @powellstacie
1	@NGC3314 +1 for book placement
1	This week on @astrotweeps is @AndreeaFont  who's talking about playing w/ fake galaxies to learn about real ones :-) https://t.co/AWft8c1uk4
1	@BenneHolwerda gods I'm glad she's ok
1	@DrRubidium @lisamjarvis hickeys but without the fun part
1	@te_pickering @brianwolven Christ
1	@DrMRFrancis @fivefifths many
-1	@kejames we just barely missed it  caught the end. I sure as hell hope she's ok
1	@WoodLloydWood @MoonriseFest yep  this was in the evening and it was shining. Bonus real moon in background :)
-1	@brianwolven though tbh if cleaning up everyone else's mess  @MrTrashWheel is probably a Ms :/
1	@brianwolven @jsnell @MrTrashWheel yaaaaassss
1	@brianwolven @jsnell I made sure to refer to Baltimore's 🚈 earlier today
1	@jdlafontaine hey  @eteq  next time you name a new dwarf galaxy  you should totally name it Pygmy
-1	@PlanetDr yikes  i didn't realize that! how **awful**
1	@jr_pritchard pretty sure that was back in April ;)
1	@astronomeara I bet there's not even any meowing
1	@astronomeara still
1	@astronomeara even though he only has 14 more followers than my cat?!
1	@mcnees huh
1	@mcnees doesn't look accurate--- https://t.co/iVtksOh3lu *definitely* has many dozens of "self-citations"
-1	@kennicosmith ugh. 6am flights awful. Hope mom is ok
1	@brianwolven heh
1	@brianwolven wah?
-1	@mcnees "Christ  what an asshole."
1	@mcnees @Gap @PsychScientists einstien  lol
-1	@njgoldbaum @yt_astro bad habit
1	@njgoldbaum @yt_astro don't know why I was messing with install script
1	@njgoldbaum @yt_astro ooooh yeah that's what I did last time. I guess I didn't properly replicate :) thanks
1	@njgoldbaum @yt_astro need dev with source for trident
1	@njgoldbaum @yt_astro basically  did exactly what had worked so well for osx  but on linux
1	@njgoldbaum @yt_astro not really sure how to use either and am about to leave for the day :-) I did have inst_conda = 0 bc astroconda
1	@njgoldbaum @yt_astro  interestingly *not* needed on any of the osx installations: https://t.co/jQAEpWsuT4
-1	@mcnees you're depressing
1	@JohnDebes @merrdiff hey john what's the WBS for "I need to read Harry Potter RIGHT NOW"?
1	@merrdiff 2007....I remember picking up DH at midnight at a local B&amp;N and baaasically not putting it down til 4pm. good times.
1	@merrdiff I was having it delivered to work  so therefore could not fall for the "we'll deliver it at midnight!!" ruse
1	@kejames thanks :) one of my favorites  even if I got the date wrong-- August 2005  shortly before starting grad school! strong memories...
1	@astronomeara @united ughgghhhghhh
1	@astronomeara @united wow. That's what? 5  6 hours?
1	@michael_w_busch @astrotweeps have you read both? I thought the 3rd wasn't out in English yet  but has same translator as first.
1	@BenneHolwerda @astrotweeps I second station 11
1	@astrotweeps Three Body Problem Ancillary Sword trilogy
-1	@realscientists cross-pollination of different education research programs. eg: do physics ed  math ed  chem ed etc. learn from each other?
1	@realscientists muggy Baltimore morning here. Just got back from the grocery store  now time to read a student's paper!
1	@realscientists good morning!
1	@JohnDebes yay having a hashtag
1	@kejames sure  but also  balloons!
1	@mcnees asshat troll
1	@AcademicsSay @realscientists @MissSinBin 100% accurate
1	@PlanetDr ja  pretend :)
1	@PlanetDr "Prof. Hickenlooper" / "Dr. Hickenlooper" TOTALLY going to be my made up scientist names now because TOTALLY MADE UP NAME
1	@PlanetDr OMG HICKENLOOPER IS A REAL NAME THANK YOU SARAH this is information i needed this makes me smile
1	@PlanetDr @sarahkendrew flash floods on 83S but dry on way to parking garage
1	@PlanetDr @brianwolven i was astounded to see the rain gauge
-1	@PlanetDr @brianwolven south baltimore. i tried leaving before the storm hit and drove through the beginning bad of it.
1	@brianwolven @PlanetDr nearly done here. Over two inches!
1	@sarahkendrew @jegpeek I remember visiting Baltimore in July after 3 years on LA &amp; being surprised at the thunder
1	@kashanacauley @mirikramer we will always have ice cream and cash Biden with us in our hearts
1	@kejames @hourlykitten @edbites it's not hourly  and she's not really a kitten anymore...but @deltacarina is always sourced to herself
1	@sondy does remind one why MD is not a in-the-bag "blue" state
1	@sondy was wondering if you'd get to see this!!!
1	@brettmor @nhuntwalker @sharelatex wait  tagging ppl in a tweet isn't the same as an email? :-D
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor @sharelatex got it! I had a [draft] after the \documentclass b/c overleaf was timing out--- removed it &amp; good to go!
1	@nhuntwalker @brettmor @sharelatex and it's same if figure is eps  png  jpg  pdf.... and also the same in the render and in the dl'd pdf
1	@brettmor @nhuntwalker @sharelatex this...an EXCLUSIVE SNEAK PEEK of our figures.... https://t.co/16VG06vsLa
-1	@BenneHolwerda this one was a review of an article on Tinsley  based on both of her biographies. Which I have. Sitting on my shelf unread :(
1	@BenneHolwerda @emsque of course!! cartoons  even :-)
1	@orzelc ok  @mcnees is my favorite new verb
1	@NGC3314 Christ
1	@JohnDebes  1) "as one does" 2) metaphor for a calibration meeting?
1	@mcnees mission accomplished
1	@nhuntwalker I've friends who changed their names based on script to ensure new names could be spelled w/ periodic table symbols (perl  tho)
-1	@njgoldbaum i cannot understate the amount of frustration i've had with this in the past. this time  so smooth  i keep poking it  confused.
1	@nhuntwalker @iDIKher Python script
1	@nhuntwalker @iDIKher depends on the kid  yeah? some B+ is huuuuge effort  others  laziness
1	@nhuntwalker @iDIKher after-school programs FTW. Great for both "good" and "bad" kids.
1	@JohnDebes #sadface
-1	@mcnees holy shit
1	@PlanetDr sounds quite memorable
1	@mirikramer I did! I did! I thought it captured the relevant nuances.
-1	@drannawatts @jr_pritchard AND cost / benefit is low: "counts" less than time spent writing papers
1	@PlanetDr my parents' dog. his name is Huey  because "he hovers. like a helicopter."
1	@DrRubidium bonus: inside and air-conditioned?
1	@realscientists @cbrnewzealand yay @AucklandUni!
1	@realscientists @BLHSMendis @RealSciMods hello!
-1	@PeterDEdmonds we could have a whole series! "10 ways to not be an asshole when co-authoring a paper" "10 ways to not be an asshole when..."
1	@mcnees ❤️
1	@jegpeek @BenneHolwerda bonus twitter autocomplete suggestion: https://t.co/Kif2Dji16B
1	@jegpeek @BenneHolwerda does a keynote file named "figure pile" count as a "master design doc"? #askingforfriend
1	@erinleeryan @sondy does this mean all-male photos of scientists are also sexist? Please say yes
1	@DrMRFrancis that's how us chromies feel using firefox
1	@jegpeek @DavidJHelfand "Think everything you believe."
1	@JohnDebes and eat donuts
1	@astrotweeps more pictures please!!!
1	@startorialist color me impressed!
1	@BoingBoing cc @startorialist
1	@DrMRFrancis amen
1	@jegpeek i'm so flabbergasted twitter actually DID something
1	@jegpeek he got banned?! that's AWESOME!!
1	@artologica @nccomfort I lol'd.
-1	@jbprime @eteq yep. parallel deep fields will be all the rage!
1	@sondy ...I just realized @ObservatoryCats follows @deltacarina but not me. I'm kind of proud.
1	@eteq @btucker22 unproductive
1	@JohnDebes @rosemcgowan (same image was @stsci's header image until the recent Crab image was released...)
1	Hey @JohnDebes check out @rosemcgowan's header image :-) STIS has made it big-time!! #STISfunfact https://t.co/O9x6QQlOZB
1	@josh_sokol done anything on @SuperASASSN?
1	@josh_sokol no  seriously  i'm not sure i remembered it was a binary ;)
1	@josh_sokol OJ 287!! I know very little about this given I'm a coauthor on a not well-cited 2010 about it
1	@mirikramer deleted!
1	@astrotweeps but if I go do I get an Antartica passport stamp ?
1	OH HEY @corbett is hosting @astrotweeps this week!! FROM THE SOUTH POLE!! ⛄️🔭🐧 https://t.co/OUJdccuvFL
1	@hubbahubble @jr_pritchard even *better* situated for negotiation in the future
-1	@jr_pritchard @hubbahubble like  it super-sucks at the time  but being extra-established as a starting faculty *really* helps 1st few years
1	@jr_pritchard @hubbahubble though  tbh  folks who go through rigamarole more than once are better suited to negotiate  start new groups  etc
1	@jr_pritchard @hubbahubble?
1	@DrMRFrancis it'd be so entertaining if that wasn't the case :(
1	@hubbahubble currently (finally) reading the wired article  saw thing re tmrw's panel. that's awesome! i hope it goes well / is fulfilling!
1	@DrRubidium brill
1	@OmanReagan @mirikramer NASA is seen by some as a vehicle for science  by some as a way to develop technologies useful for military defense?
1	@mirikramer I guess it's: how much of a "speech" is the words vs the action  the event?
1	@mirikramer isn't even being present political though?
1	@DrRubidium I want to like this once for the message and again for your gif game
-1	@eteq damn  Alan Rickman still gets me
1	@eteq ouuuups
1	@joaoalves and Lehner cc @jegpeek @jchowk
1	@astronomeara the good stuff? without being there about all I can say is "anything real Kona"
1	@astronomeara you gonna pay for it? Including the snorkeling equipment  piña coladas  and everything I need from Waimea coffee company
1	@astronomeara *observer
1	@astrotweeps magnetic fields
1	@astronomeara @DeepAstronomy spotted in the wild #futureinspace #luvoir https://t.co/pBQGyFpfva
1	@JohnDebes "there was traffic"
1	@nhuntwalker @dalcantonJD ...color-coded by velocity groups!
-1	@astrotweeps @DPFink something perverse about that much data turning into an animated gif
1	@astronomeara I don't even have a STIS one! (Hey @JohnDebes ...)
1	@astronomeara https://t.co/3zs2AKG1Bk
1	@astrotweeps moar pictures plz
1	@MBKplus @jbprime @cooperUCI I have like 8 or 9...
1	@BenneHolwerda but don't worry  i have gin in the freezer the cucumber also gets to play with
-1	@BenneHolwerda i dislike tonic
1	@njgoldbaum if when i'm trying to remember the password i have the guidelines of what was / wasn't allowed  i can usually get it
1	@jbprime @eteq galaxies!
1	@DrMRFrancis yes
1	@nhuntwalker @shaka_lulu and @SiouxperNova!
1	@JohnDebes *ad
1	@AllPlanets Christ that's quite a visual
1	@Emmerge @jegpeek omg
1	@NGC3314 @NASAWebb yeeeeahh
-1	@NASAWebb that is kind of terrifying
1	@NASAWebb O.O !!
1	(And  of course  @astronomeara is responsible for the bumper sticker awesomeness #luvoir) https://t.co/ZL2dTdSaCi
1	@PlanetDr @NASAJPL that about sums it up
1	@jegpeek @tonyfan4ever @stsci #sadface
-1	@jegpeek I miss gmail :(
1	@jegpeek is that what you use?
1	@mcnees looks new to me!
1	@astrotweeps \rho / \bar{\rho} = 1  natch
1	@astrotweeps nm  did maths  ok. carry on.
1	@astrotweeps ?? I'd go with 1.
1	@BenneHolwerda new one will fit king size comforter though :):)
1	@BenneHolwerda I can usually get a load in per week....
1	@mcnees and see how easy it is to give credit
1	@DrMRFrancis yaaaaas
1	@NGC3314 @BenneHolwerda 3rd book comes out in English in September
1	@jchowk @cfroning @BenneHolwerda O.O
1	@cfroning @BenneHolwerda I also rec Station Eleven. Beautiful.
1	@BenneHolwerda ah :)  have you read the ancillary justice trilogy?
1	@BenneHolwerda already finish it? :)
1	@mcnees @deray fucking A
1	@mcnees now imagine if you were also female
1	@SCTrager @El_Lobo_Rayado @BenneHolwerda "but are the senior people who don't do Twitter really worth connecting with?"
1	@mcnees lol
1	@El_Lobo_Rayado @SCTrager @BenneHolwerda dooooo iiiiiittt
1	@SCTrager @BenneHolwerda BONUS: easy way to get student's name to other people in community  "meet" other people w/out $$
-1	@SCTrager @BenneHolwerda 1000%. I just found a paper that was basically written in response to one of mine &amp; no one ever emailed it to me :(
1	@DrRubidium 😂
1	Now David Rosario continues on what we can learn about mid-IR AGN with @NASAWebb #jwstroe https://t.co/BMKlxhU2df
1	Summary of Rieke's talk: [Ne VI] and how what's been learned from @NASAspitzer will be useful for @NASAWebb #jwstroe https://t.co/cp0eV0K1LZ
1	@jegpeek relevant to our interests: https://t.co/37dYLOVQSv #dtu
1	@aussiastronomer 😂😴
1	@mcnees surprising part being that it's been filed  not that it happened
1	@biphenyl @dalcantonJD oh  yes! i thought was response to the spatial resolution comparison. one issue is no GO on Euclid  yes?
1	@NGC3314 @sarahkendrew @NatureNews that's 4 words :P
1	What's your #threewordthesis? @NatureNews is collecting them :) https://t.co/pJmWkaiKy0
1	@Harcel @massimastro @BenneHolwerda @astrosteven @npr247 yay for being able to see stuff!
1	@Harcel @BenneHolwerda @astrosteven take @npr247's bet :)
-1	@Harcel @BenneHolwerda @astrosteven @npr247 nothing is crazy expensive right now with the current GBP
1	@massimastro @BenneHolwerda @astrosteven ("sheer luck" is astronomer speak for "cosmic variance")
1	@BenneHolwerda @astrosteven all I know is @npr247 is betting a bottle of Ardbeg #JWST will find a z=20 galaxy in the first year. #jwstroe
1	@NGC3314 to be sure. which is why easy readability = major benefit! (@massimastro is "early-career"?)
1	#HotSci @STScI today: @eteq on dwarf gals &amp; Barrera-Ballesteros on @MaNGASurvey. 3:30pm EDT https://t.co/dP4m8h5QTq https://t.co/y6VWd15iet
1	@hubbahubble samesame
-1	@ProfMike_M i meant to time how long it'd take to get a response like that.  i dislike drinking ashtrays.
1	@BenneHolwerda not that i know of. my understanding is "key" drives design; clearly not the case here
-1	@ProfMike_M (final disclaimer: even though I'm at ST  i actually have nothing to do with running our TAC. just hear lots about it.)
1	@ProfMike_M now this is a bigger issue to address than just how to allocate telescope time!
1	@ProfMike_M and i'm unconvinced any change in organization structure can truly address that.
1	@ProfMike_M what i'm saying is when science case is good but data being requested can't actually achieve it. wool over eyes of non-experts
1	@ProfMike_M yeah  that too :)
1	@ProfMike_M oh sure. but "doable" isn't clear cut. observe SgrA* from Scotland? not doable. answer science Q with certain data? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1	@ProfMike_M currently  can't observe ANYTHING from scotland! ☁️☁️☁️
1	@ProfMike_M i find they are fairly intertwined
1	@ProfMike_M ... when *no* experts can weigh in
1	@ProfMike_M I'm *not* saying decisions should be made *solely* by experts; am saying issues can arise (akin to your random num generator)...
1	@ProfMike_M ... basically always choose smaller program  especially if no expert in the room who can actually speak to differences
-1	@ProfMike_M another trap: 2 proposals both claim to do same science  one asks for half the time. non-expert panel psychology will ...
1	@ProfMike_M in theory  I agree. but in practice  means time can go to team w/ best salesmanship  not actually the best science. annoying.
1	@BenneHolwerda early release science and otherwise. GTOs basically know what they want (hence why they built the instruments!)
1	@old_pyjamas @ProfMike_M uh  that's 100% irrelevant.
1	@ProfMike_M in a science utopia  perhaps that would work
1	@ProfMike_M seems to also run issue of people who are conflicted cannot review  leaving proposals subject to review by non-experts
1	@ProfMike_M do you have a better method than what is currently done?
1	Definite theme so far is "we've learned so much from @NASAspitzer! imagine how zomg @NASAWebb will be!!" (paraphrased) #jwstroe
1	@erinleeryan cc @startorialist
1	@BenneHolwerda #woopwoop
1	@kejames i'm in scotland and am yet to see or hear a bagpipe
1	@PlanetDr bummed all the action will be in the middle of the night here
1	@hubbahubble number 1 reasons to have conferences  tbh
1	@PlanetDr @sarahkendrew to be fair  i went for a run here yesterday and it was lovely  in part because it wasn't sweltering hot
1	@aussiastronomer oooh cake
1	@PlanetDr @sarahkendrew 🙉
1	@newscientist @DrRubidium yeah  it it is a well done costuming / lighting / etc
-1	@newscientist @DrRubidium and that's not even a picture of her :(
1	@kejames so  you know  actual stuffs
1	@astrotweeps hallo!
1	@astrodave2 nothing is infinite :)
1	@aussiastronomer mmm....nap.....
1	probably the biggest recent new #JWST news is that @NASAWebbTelescp is now @NASAWebb :-) #jwstroe
-1	@astrokiwi @AAOastro strange and annoying
1	@cosmicpinot @AAOastro before the brexit vote I was like "oh my god how have they not voted yet" and then I was like "oh"
1	@corbett @aussiastronomer tylenol pm (depending on length of flight)  also: good eye mask + noise canceling headphones
1	uh  Australia  @AAOastro  this is kind of weird. https://t.co/a1FdLE0Wcv
1	@albertoconti I don't see NEARLY enough old bay there
1	@DrRubidium ooooooh
1	@astrotweeps took me quiiiite a while to figure out that authors were mis-referencing each other!
1	@astrotweeps 👋
-1	@astrotweeps poor 16sw :'(
-1	@astrotweeps and also terribly misnamed in much of the literature! See footnote in https://t.co/lHAgUuyPX6
1	@mcnees ☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️ #ImissLA
1	@mcnees a what now
1	@mcnees no. https://t.co/gBCazvXp5Z
-1	@mcnees I'm not looking forward to adjusting my circadian rhythms in Edinburgh Sunday :(
1	@NASAWebb YAY shorter handle!!
1	@mcnees i wouldn't say i'm a "fan" of clinton  but....this does make my heart go pitter-patter a little
1	@DrRubidium ~gulp~  (I'm suitably impressed!)
1	@DrRubidium is your barre class really as early in the morning as it seems like it is?
1	@lynn_carter8 @sondy yep
-1	@mcnees gonna miss them
1	@kennicosmith it is in fact pretty sweet
1	(as team lead &amp; moving-target guru  @JohnDebes can tell you how much of a #STISfunfact-filled time it was getting observations to happen...)
1	@astrotweeps tweet?
-1	@jbprime that's galaxy-speak for "drunk"  @astronomeara
-1	@jbprime wtf is up with gizmo
1	@DrRubidium haven't looked at list but....all white heroes?
1	@sondy be safe
-1	@ProfMike_M unclear  actually. Visa is through Swedish spouse's right to be there...  Meanwhile 10% of their savings disappeared overnight
-1	@JohnDebes idk  maybe slam on the breaks?  and it's not like a human  let alone a driverless car  can tell the diff btwn "Doctor" &amp; "robber"
-1	@JohnDebes I couldn't complete it. Only factor in some is gender of victim?!
1	@alicebell @jr_pritchard wow
1	@aomawa @hubbahubble filed under "work w/ people who you want to work w/"; collaboration not just about shared interests but comfort  safety
1	@JohnDebes @Astro_Wright @astroprofhoff what about it?
1	@JohnDebes @Astro_Wright @astroprofhoff candidate also likely to not know who is on "the committee"  who is influential  etc
-1	@mcnees yeah  just found &amp; read that. seems...bizarre
1	@mcnees https://t.co/ijDEvP4KvO
1	@mcnees ~blink~  *googles*
1	@mcnees @niais that was FOUR DAYS AGO you can't expect it to be relevant NOW?!
1	@mcnees I wonder when the last time the cameras were turned off was
1	@BenneHolwerda @iva_momcheva https://t.co/fUpaLtlB9H
1	@BenneHolwerda @iva_momcheva now I don't have to RT it for this year
1	@mcnees hostage is when a bill with 53 yays  47 nays = failed. because MATH.
1	@StartsWithABang @AdamFrank4 @nytimes "may"
1	@PlanetDr thinking of you today
-1	@PlanetDr Monday the pilot began an announcement with  "At the risk of starting a mutiny...."
1	@aussiastronomer @TroyBernier cc @TrueSciPhi
1	@PlanetDr https://t.co/RNBK8KxHqw
1	@PlanetDr oh jeez  that's particularly inconsiderate
-1	@PlanetDr oh gods that's maddening
1	@PlanetDr ugh. i hope you can make your connection and get where you're going. superannoying.
1	@PlanetDr @Delta YAY!
1	@hubbahubble ptango!
1	@mcnees surely that's more than covered. Donate: https://t.co/s6vilKyqn7
1	@willowdower @jegpeek @ashleenwilkins and by if one or both senators have spoken yet &amp; by party
1	@jegpeek @willowdower I was able to get to Mikulski's box but not Cardin's
1	@mcnees tried but @SenatorCardin's voicemail is full!! #holdthefloor
1	@SenatorBarb @SenatorCardin thank you for speaking up today
1	@kejames @PlanetDr the jumping!!!! i don't know if i've ever been so excited about something as he is about that
1	@PlanetDr @kejames not a bunny  but the jumping!! https://t.co/pAyPszb83I
-1	@kejames really sorry that happened to you
1	@kejames WHAT
1	@BadPhysics kitty toys?
1	@kevinschawinski *i* do! as with most things  problem isn't me  it's everyone else :-P
-1	@kevinschawinski @nobelprize doesn't mean it's not a problem. morally wrong to ascribe this success to only three people.
-1	@kevinschawinski @nobelprize except for the fucking ridiculous "only three individuals" nonsense
-1	@mcnees saw that earlier (before deleted) with a big dose of what the actual fuck
1	@artologica @Alex_Parker @brianwolven @ZachWeiner TI-89. Natch
1	@merrdiff @NASAWebbTelescp #sigh
1	@DrMRFrancis @maggiekb1 @pourmecoffee it was clear :)
1	@DrMRFrancis @maggiekb1 @pourmecoffee policing language is just another way gents like to control women
1	@mirikramer sweet!
-1	@DrRubidium ugh
1	@PlanetDr @jemillerwbal whoa
1	@scorfano @BenneHolwerda then we're all outta ideas
1	@JohnDebes am camped out with laptop in @CafeAzafran. not ideal  but doable.
1	@astrotweeps I just got a great idea for the February 2018 TIPS 🍾
1	@josh_sokol not for H0. DE yes
1	@josh_sokol will ask. Help which part exactly ?
1	@erinleeryan @astrotweeps @MarkDavidLacy STIS has about a zillion modes  like zomg. #STISfunfact #quantifiablytrue
1	@BenneHolwerda @astronomeara and here I was like  "10? le sigh"
1	@jchowk @sondy also: passive language. And "that"
1	@jchowk @sondy check for inverted language. Eg "rate of formation" --&gt; "formation rate"
1	Not my style but cc @startorialist  https://t.co/sjZAggQbpo
1	@sondy @brianwolven ❤️❤️
1	@brianwolven @sondy to be fair  my mom is quite tech-savvy. she just like sending things on paper :)
1	@evolscientist @PlanetDr @USPS @sondy I'm not stupid enough to ever expect anything out of the 21230 folks
1	@PlanetDr @USPS @sondy actually I somehow just got 6 sheets. + a few sheets of forever global moons!
-1	@PlanetDr @USPS @sondy NoooooooooooOOOOOOoooooooooo  I was going to wait half an hour to buy because of obnoxiousness of making an account:(
1	@astrotweeps webex?
-1	@astrotweeps damn!
1	@mcnees yep
1	@sondy get a super good cooler
1	@astrotweeps is "innate talent" even the relevant metric?
1	@astrotweeps wow.
1	@astrotweeps have you ever lived more than 100 miles from where you grew up?
1	@astrotweeps hey  John  what's an echelle?
1	@astrotweeps lolz #oh1997
1	@astrotweeps O.O
1	@astrotweeps the internet makes knocking soooooo much easier
-1	@astrotweeps wouldn't work nowadays :/
1	Yeah so apparently my team lead  @JohnDebes  is running @astrotweeps this wk. I wonder if he'll livetweet meetings? https://t.co/GK4UOGALxp
-1	@astrotweeps canceled meeting time is the bestest time
1	@astrotweeps the @stsci lists are likely more up to date / complete
1	@astrotweeps @FimusTauri see also: if @HubbleTelescope directly overhead Baltimore  it's closer to @stsci than Boston is !
-1	@starstryder sex without worries about pregnancy!!!
1	@JohnDebes @josh_sokol yep
1	@josh_sokol I am? :)
1	@biochembelle @DrMRFrancis wait. Wait wait. ALL replies get seen by ALL of my followers?! da fuk?
1	@mcnees end of an era
1	@mcnees s/men/women/
1	@kevinriggle @sondy (is this in response to https://t.co/FrZ6UxhRUO ?) (i'm totally stoked)
1	@brianwolven @markgurwell @owlbar (neither had i)
1	@NASAWebbTelescp @astraughnomer the JWST version of https://t.co/ZRqpvZRcb7 ? :)
1	@NASAWebbTelescp @astraughnomer fair enough :)
1	@astraughnomer btw I loved loved loved all those pics....the only woman in the room was also the only scientist 😍
1	@astraughnomer Bill Nye effect?
1	@brianwolven @abbey_burger @OtherOrbScience On menu. "Baltimore burger"  #omnomnom
-1	@brianwolven damn  now i want a crab dip bacon cheeseburger. cc @Abbey_Burger
1	@starstryder !
1	@brianwolven the @OwlBar has a good crap dip pizza
1	@astrokatey ahahahahahahaha
1	@jegpeek @yongAstro currently watching https://t.co/K31Tl71bpU
1	@PeterDEdmonds @josh_sokol probably some planetary atmospheres that succeed
1	@PeterDEdmonds @josh_sokol VERY few examples where actual spectra are visually shown rather than illustrations of interpretations of results
-1	@JohnDebes for the older kids I wonder who much of it is affected by how stupidly early we have the school day start
1	@JohnDebes @sarahkendrew I'm so glad I turned off notifications for that group.
1	@mcnees isn't that weird tho? "I like this place but I can't say why"
-1	@mcnees it's the next morning and i'm still kind of sad i don't have an answer to this  having spent upwards of 4 months cumulative there
1	@Astro_BL what was the most enlightening thing you learned ?
1	@mcnees I'm honestly not sure
-1	@mcnees damn I miss Santa Barbara
1	@mcnees BOOO NO IV STAY IN SB OR AT LEAST GOLETA
1	@mcnees omg ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Santa Barbara
1	@BonnieMeinke @groorg1 @artologica @asrivkin @brianwolven @ArtscapeBmore @stsci this makes me so happy
1	@mcnees lolz
1	@astrotweeps Hi Michael!
1	@groorg1 @YAE_STSCI of interest: https://t.co/Gm3cPULgbl
1	@PlanetDr same one that was hanging out @brewersart Wednesday? more social than I am!
1	Of interest to @PlanetDr and @sarahkendrew https://t.co/yzQPYJTCyd
1	@sarahkendrew @planetdr #ImissLA
1	@DrRubidium @stedwardsu congratulations!!!!!
1	@davidwhogg @jegpeek @willowdower $
1	@BenneHolwerda WE'VE PAID OUR DUES AND DONE OUR TIME NOW SET US FREEE
1	@BenneHolwerda BUT THIS IS MAY IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THIS
1	@hubbahubble 😂
-1	@Alex_Parker @PlanetDr @lukedones [ insert spoiler quote here ]
1	@PlanetDr @Alex_Parker @lukedones and @deltacarina can hear it on the chimney https://t.co/7TU3XMM39m
1	@PlanetDr @Alex_Parker @lukedones two more and we hit a record https://t.co/vA38s9dJ14
1	@BadPhysics @MerriamWebster they are and it's fantastic
1	@Summer_Ash @lukedones @mcnees @DrMRFrancis https://t.co/rprUZYOVE1
1	@Summer_Ash @DrMRFrancis is there a link or screenshot anywhere?
1	@AstroKatie @PeterDEdmonds @RachelFeltman it's a "mentor had a good set of data"-project. same with finding planets.
1	@jegpeek @sdssurveys "same same....but different"
1	@JohnDebes @astrokiwi it also says you're on the COS/STIS Instrument team :)
-1	@JohnDebes tbh started as "what the hell have i done in the last year that i need to put on my scieval" so hopefully i'll keep it uptodate?
1	@JohnDebes @astrokiwi I used to have "last updated" on the pages. Might need to add that again!
1	@Summer_Ash Cool! @AstroAthens was in one of our first #BDNYC cohorts (I think) &amp; it's awesome to see her active on the outreach scene!
1	@MissAerospace @Summer_Ash @TrueSciPhi Ha  good eye!
1	Matching auto-replies from @jen_gupta as evidence of how fun her job is! ;)
1	@DrRob_Thacker @vrooje @startorialist (there are discount codes on site like @zazzle all the time)
1	@mcnees Bonkers is putting it mildly!
1	@mrtommyb @badreligion @elsisrad Hope you enjoy @againstme  too!
1	@jradavenport @aussiastronomer That I can live with (I hope)
1	@aussiastronomer @jradavenport That's what baby leave is  right? ;)
1	@aussiastronomer @jradavenport NOW I NEED TO MAKE A PARODY VIDEO OF THIS!!!!!
1	@aussiastronomer You magnificent genius! (I had missed it)
-1	@aussiastronomer I wish it were that easy! Non-tenured+parental leave = quiet Emily :(
1	@aussiastronomer Yes indeed! 'Reasonable accommodations' etc. etc. etc. I'm sure HR knows about them.
1	@Jeyhan @kevinschawinski @HdxAcademy @JonHaidt Could also be small number statistics - 10x less compared to other fields
1	@stoutde Exactly.
1	@cmp150writes @StarTalkRadio Also  planets can be detected by observing a star 'wobble' ever so slightly as the planets orbit.
1	@cmp150writes @StarTalkRadio If the timing of the shadows changes slightly  that's evidence for more planets in the system.
1	@cmp150writes @StarTalkRadio We have evidence that multi-planet systems are common  but we're still not able to detect the smallest/furthest
-1	@mikamckinnon Tragedy of Sandy in Staten Island partially caused by false alarm of Irene the previous year  bc people delayed evacuation :(
1	@abigailStev @badreligion Awesome! You might enjoy this: https://t.co/jCR62G7eqN cc @jegpeek
1	@jegpeek What's not to love about a band featuring the Brian May of bio/punk? ;)
1	So I described @SOFIAtelescope as a 747 with a @HubbleTelescope in the back (they're about the same diameter mirrors). To @DoctorGraffin.
1	I had brought @NASA &amp; @SOFIAtelescope stickers. One needs no explanation  but the other hadn't seen first light yet.
1	Thank you @sondy  and @hubbahubble &amp; @berkeleyjess  for leading the field in speaking out. https://t.co/urUp3rrJRj #astroSH #astroally
1	@astro_alexis @jfaherty @kellecruz @SIPL68 Thanks so much!
1	@SIPL68 I have not seen this before - Thanks! Any chance you could scan the whole article or send more info?
1	@JacquelynGill Reminds me of this: https://t.co/GkuzUmamJb
1	So many familiar faces - and a @startorialist front &amp; center! https://t.co/iNKYRzKCiA
-1	@mcnees It's a curse. You have it  I have it  @nialldeacon has it...
-1	@mcnees Is this a threat or a challenge? It's been a while since I made a new parody video....
1	@UrbanAstroNYC @sarahcottentail @StarTalkRadio @Summer_Ash ➡️bucket list
1	@UrbanAstroNYC @sarahcottentail That would basically be @startorialist on @StarTalkRadio  which totally has to happen at some point!
1	@aussiastronomer At UCLA we used to share iTunes libraries on the network  which was fun. I think @ikashell had the Little Mermaid!
1	@aussiastronomer PART OF YOUR WOOOOOORLD
1	@jegpeek @Summer_Ash Do we call leading dudes patriarchs? Founding fathers  I guess. I don't like implying 'mothering' as women's value.
1	@Summer_Ash @jegpeek I'd love to find out! Maria Mitchell Observatory &amp; Swope Telescope  seem to be doing okay.
1	@jegpeek @Summer_Ash But an even better way to honor matriarchs (what a word) is to make more of them.
-1	@jegpeek @Summer_Ash Naming after a women: fine. Randomly assigning female gender despite overwhelmingly male team/field: bullshit.
1	@aussiastronomer  Good idea! I see twitches from the outside  but no recognizable features yet.
1	@Summer_Ash @aschwortz Truth!
1	@mcnees Wait till you see what I've got already - there's more for babies &amp; kids than for adults!
1	@ShenovaFashion Aww  thanks!
1	@aomawa We'd love it if you sent us photos of you wearing them for @startorialist! Cc @astronobeads
1	@kejames I've only done annual reports so far  and all but one were approved very quickly with no further communication.
1	@chris_tibbs https://t.co/PpdSWGsnhs
1	@murdomesser But @NASAWebb (&amp; @NASA_TESS) will help us understand these *types* of planets &amp; their atmospheres.
1	@murdomesser I'm not sure... might be too bright of a target for @NASAWebb! JWST will focus on transiting planets  not RV planets like this.
1	@startorialist Oops  of course not! Boo  @target!
1	@sarahcottentail @StarkeyStardust @DrFunkySpoon It's your world  we're just sciencing in it 💖💖💖
1	Heyyyyyyy we are getting very close to nice round numbers of followers (base ten) for @startorialist on Twitter  Instagram  &amp; Tumblr...
1	@sarahcottentail Luckily the guy was harmless and very polite. I am amazed I held it together for that long!
1	@pkgw @jasonleecurtis_ @jradavenport Fair compensation &amp; benefits makes it easier for many to participate in science.
1	@pkgw @jasonleecurtis_ @jradavenport Agreed  but for different reasons. Research=job in order to value time  effort  skills  etc.
1	@abigailStev Also @megschwamb @sarahkendrew @niais might be able to help!
1	@AdamFrank4 Planetary-mass object  until it is proven to have formed around a star!
1	@StarTalkRadio @planetjuneberry Yup  that's me! Wardrobe by/because of @startorialist  for all your #Astrofashion needs!
1	I'm in a posting frenzy at @startorialist so I won't RT them all  but this is one of my faves! https://t.co/3agNsIHUjC
1	@aventureralicia Thanks for the photo! Mind if I post it on @startorialist?
1	@reneehlozek Love your research group hashbrown! #hnauts
-1	@keckobservatory @JohnDebes Autocorrect or inter-instrumental rivalry? ;)
1	@JohnDebes Is it still being called NIRSpec to distinguish from @keckobservatory instrument?
1	@demitrimuna People or ... old white dudes? I am not surprised in the least.
1	@jradavenport @merrdiff Theater gels are also super fun to play with when experimenting with light! Esp. sample sets w/ transmission curves.
1	@jradavenport @merrdiff @kgarofali @PeterYoachim @brettmor A spruce goose? (https://t.co/ohhtSB5pLB)
1	@jradavenport @merrdiff @kgarofali @PeterYoachim @brettmor Titanic was the biggest  fanciest ship of its time! It just happened to sink.
1	@aussiastronomer I feel like that's typical of new jobs: firehose of info you can't process at the beginning  then random drips later on!
1	@aussiastronomer Oh! 'Weird' is not the word I would use...🤑
1	@aussiastronomer Yikes! It is nontrivial to go from grant to paycheck (even after getting the grant!)  but it is oh so worth it.
1	@aussiastronomer My 9-month salary is paid over 12 months. If I have summer salary from a grant  it ~doubles my paycheck!
-1	@startorialist @w00ki33 So jealous! Give her an extra 🙌 from me!
1	@pkgw @dstndstn https://t.co/tkio14HHg9
1	@PlanetDr @astrobetter @enceladude Yay! I still use it myself  and thank past Emily for sparing no detail.
1	I'm bringing fabric posters on @astronomyontap  @startorialist  &amp; #Astro101 labs to the @sdssurveys collaboration meeting  because I can!
1	My @startorialist outfit for #SpeedScience at @AMNH tonight! https://t.co/Q1c1HzEYRN
1	@mikamckinnon That's exactly what we do with @astronomyontap! I'm still looking for someone to start Geology on the Rocks... 😜
1	@jegpeek @astro_alexis You should be asking  what's taking the rest of astronomy so long to catch up? ;)
-1	How nerdy would it be if I asked @EllenStofan to sign my Venus First Day of Issue envelope? @USPS @WorldStampShowN https://t.co/WJsih7P9SV
-1	@astrokatey APS offers ~$10k grants  but competition is tough. I wish @AAS_Office did something similar  even if it were less $$$.
1	@Summer_Ash @astropixie @startorialist One AAS Hack Day  @eblur27 set up @IFTTT for us  just after we launched (so 2014 I think)
1	@mcnees Oh good  cuz I already lost 5 minutes trying to figure that one out...!
1	@mcnees I like to think he's the same character in SV and Freaks &amp; Geeks...
1	@GoAstroMo @browndwarfs @EllieInSpace Maybe try @AnnorlundaInc? Small company specializing in short ebooks.
-1	@jegpeek nope  unfortunately not - we only have October 2013 &amp; March 2016 events.
1	@jegpeek @rhaegal records &amp; edits @AoTATX for YouTube  though!
1	@jegpeek Not usually. Sometimes @waystationbk has streaming that's recorded  but we only have two events  one saved &amp; one online.
-1	@jegpeek @MarsRovers Yeah  even (especially?) when @NASAjpl does it  it's gross. Why not just... hire women  and pay them fairly!
1	Sometimes only @metasimpsons &amp; @Summer_Ash's @startorialist posts can get me through a long Monday...
1	@hubbahubble DON'T MIND IF I DO!!!   (power's back  whew)
1	@PeterDEdmonds And the one where he throws the radio down the well!
1	@pkgw I should have included you in my original tweet! You can be BDNYC-North ;)
1	The stories behind @astronomyontap  @startorialist  &amp; my 'secret' identity! https://t.co/173kocidn3
1	@Summer_Ash Twinsies!!! And @startorialist is on there!
1	@Summer_Ash @startorialist I bow to your witty captions! (Yours should go on the Instagram!)
1	@dalcantonJD @jegpeek IKR?!? I only learned about it at AMNH! I point it out every chance I get.
1	@jegpeek Do you know what happened to Brontosaurus? That's the *real* Pluto of the dinosaurs!
1	@iva_momcheva @KellySchwark @YurisNight I think there was one (at a planetarium?) upstate  at least in 2014...
1	@DustinGrowick @drunkascheese @startorialist I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL ALL THE PUNS ARE USED! Also  SEAtorialist for marine bio fashion!
1	@drunkascheese @DustinGrowick We're all over @ShenovaFashion at @startorialist!
1	@michelle_lmc @PBarmby Love those mid-conference runs!
1	@hubbahubble Absolutely  if it's physics related. ;)
1	@brianwolven @niais 👏👏👏 That took me a second
-1	@mcnees Oh they were not that far off. Another guy lived on dropped fruit for a summer (i.e.  not even killing plants). Indie store.
1	@astronomyblog Compilation post sounds right - compost for short ;)
-1	@aussiastronomer (I am getting my mass/radius ratios confused - bad astronomer!)
1	@aussiastronomer Is mini-Neptune definitely distinct from Neptune? I think I meant to ask about 2-6 R🌍  but that's Neptune...
1	@aussiastronomer I mean smaller than Neptune - is it worth a different designation? (I've seen mini  sub  &amp; 'gas dwarf')
1	@aussiastronomer @hubbahubble @AstroDressing
1	@mikamckinnon I've called my pool a fluid dynamics &amp; chemistry experiment for three summers now (&amp; had varying levels of success)
1	@akemdin @StarTalkRadio Aww thanks  you're too sweet! More where that came from at @startorialist ;)
1	@UpportunityU meet @AstroOnTapCO!
1	@Mad_Science_Guy Today! Just a few minutes ago :)
1	Some days all I do on here is RT @startorialist &amp; @astronomyontap  and I'm okay with that.
1	@mpgroome @PaleoExplorer RAWRtorialist for a Dino version of @startorialist  but Dinos on the Rocks could work for @astronomyontap!
1	@mcnees @Summer_Ash @gravitate_to_me My favorite quote: 'Great minds...' something something
1	@Summer_Ash @natemccrady @xeni I CAN RECITE THEM ALL!
1	@megschwamb @GeminiObs Okay  @astronomyontap Big Island to start!
1	@megschwamb @GeminiObs Yay!!! Does this mean we'll have @astronomyontap Hawai'i soon? ;)
1	@startorialist What an awesome bag  too! What are the odds a recycled banner would have a galaxy on it?!?
1	@Summer_Ash 💖 Can you come by AMNH tomorrow at all? @mikamckinnon wants us to #chirpforLIGO! Or over video chat maybe?
1	@aussiastronomer That's 10^-55 grams  right? So they would effectively travel at c  like neutrinos?
1	@Summer_Ash sez you  killin' it with @startorialist posts! ;)
1	Hi Twitter! I'm now on @instagram (same username as here) as well as contributing to @startorialist &amp; @astronomyontap feeds! Yay! 📷⭐️📷🍻📷
1	@jegpeek Done and done. And I mean done. https://t.co/mVc9rr5bFm
1	@mcnees (You follow @metasimpsons  right?)
1	@mcnees You can't quote the Simpsons in your sleep? Stand back  amateur ;) https://t.co/dqY7rtcuKS
1	@gsnarayan Thay have to come back &amp; start classes  but hopefully next time!
1	@jegpeek @laurawatkins_ What? TELL ME MORE!
1	@_hroe @astromarkmarley @PlanetDr Seconding 'Dear Colleagues' for anything in the field (REU  grad school  post doc  faculty)
1	@Mad_Science_Guy Yup  and Brokeback even!
1	@Mad_Science_Guy Nope! It's the too obvious ones probably. ;)
1	@Mad_Science_Guy Nope! I might have even seen it in the theater thanks to study abroad. :)
1	@aussiastronomer Point Break is new! Good-bye Lenin I've seen two or three times  one of my faves.
1	@sarahcottentail I like 'women crushing it' better. ;)
1	@sarahcottentail You do a great job! I just don't like in general that 1) women get one day &amp; 2) 'crush' is form of the praise
1	@davidwhogg @ashpags @rhaegal @abigailStev @jegpeek There was a poster skirt submitted to @startorialist last summer IIRC (still looking)
1	@jradavenport @hubbahubble @laurheth @brianwolven Now we're getting somewhere....! 😆
1	@natemccrady @jegpeek Fine  if you want to out yourself! Would've been funnier to let people think it was Bill Murray or something...
1	@ban8tr @sarahkendrew @jegpeek @KyleSammin Nah  I think there's an uncertainty principle that prevents it ;)
1	@jegpeek My best friend's sister's boyfriend's brother's girlfriend heard it from this guy... He might have been quoting you  though...
-1	@jegpeek @sarahkendrew @KyleSammin wise person once said to me: "there are two types of people: those w/ imposter syndrome  &amp; assholes."
1	@cmwalla @BoingBoing @ShenovaFashion @startorialist tags aren't working right... There should be four posts!
1	@cmwalla @BoingBoing We love @ShenovaFashion on @startorialist! https://t.co/u4dL53yBUS
1	@brianwolven @mcnees @Alex_Parker @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera Or find a trusted professional
1	@mcnees @brianwolven @Alex_Parker @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera !!!!! https://t.co/GFuRTNW91e
1	@Alex_Parker @brianwolven @mcnees @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera One vote for Blue Moon &amp; orange sherbet  IIRC. Dammit  now I need ice cream.
1	@Alex_Parker @brianwolven @mcnees @erinleeryan @Mpyrifera There's a place in Asbury Park  NJ with an amazing beer float menu.
1	@brianwolven @mcnees @erinleeryan I LOVE BEER FLOATS
1	@brianwolven @mcnees @erinleeryan well that escalated quickly! It's Sweet Action  before anyone rushes to judgement for Sam Adams
1	@demitrimuna This sounds like a job for @ScienceBetter!
1	@KarenLMasters @Summer_Ash @LucyNewnham1 @startorialist That's nice &amp; all but I would like a piece of actual cake! ;)
1	@mcnees I had to look up Katherine Johnson (again) but she should be a household name too: https://t.co/o1atd9QZL1
1	@becky1505 @BBCStargazing @tarquydrawers Sounds like a job for a UK-based @astronomyontap!
-1	@drarnakarick Oh  oh no. :(
1	@jegpeek @ashpags Part 2 will start day-of. (Part 1 was a lot of work! Yinz tweet too much!)
1	@ashpags @jegpeek Done!
-1	@Summer_Ash @shaka_lulu @mikamckinnon @ashpags @startorialist Did I miss anything? https://t.co/ZWdXGjKNBz
-1	@mcnees Nothing  that's just my resting exasperation  ;)
1	@rachelosten @jegpeek @astronomolly @niais I got pre-check by luck &amp; it was glorious! I'm seriously considering GE even for 1-2 trips/yr
1	@Summer_Ash @shaka_lulu @mikamckinnon @ashpags @startorialist I think the origin story is in my tweets - should I Storify?
1	.@aagie @saracamnasio @astrobites Seamful Astronomy?!?!
1	@shannonmstirone It's @Shadowplaynyc! Highly recommended.
1	@jradavenport @davidwhogg @dalcantonJD @adrianprw cc @JohnDebes #aascar
1	@kellecruz @merrdiff Cash=time&amp;money. People doing this hard work should be (richly) compensated for it!
1	I'll be at the @astronomyontap &amp; @startorialist posters (248.02 &amp; 03) after the public policy plenary (~12:30pm)! #aas227
1	@Mad_Science_Guy @jfaherty @kellecruz @PaigeAlexisG Yes - your sources were CUNY-centric but nicely representational!
1	@StartsWithABang @AstroInclusive @niais @kellecruz @astrokatey talk amongst yourselves...
1	@StartsWithABang @AstroInclusive y'all should talk about Thursday plans...!
1	@GalAstronomer @merrdiff @startorialist @Summer_Ash @ashpags @MCNebrewla uh oh! Not mine  I think....
1	@reneehlozek Send me a selfie for the post if you'd like!
1	@drarnakarick https://t.co/hS0MNiAbsq
1	Paging @jegpeek @Summer_Ash @kellecruz to the AAS Resource Center please!
1	@pkgw Well then Happy Birthday! 🎉🎈🎁
1	@MCNebrewla @startorialist Of course not! I have two costume changes in my bag ;)
1	@JohnDebes @Meg_Urry Better: have the extra work be valued/compensated by the community!
-1	@JohnDebes @Meg_Urry but this puts a lot of stress/extra work on other underrepresented minorities.
1	Are wearing an awesome science shirt at #aas227 today? Meet at the AAS booth at 5:30 pm for a @startorialist photo shoot!
-1	@DrMRFrancis @Summer_Ash Wait  there are *bad* puns?!?!?!
1	@w00ki33 @startorialist Just you wait ;)
1	@aussiastronomer Cab was ~$65 with tip - worth it to split!
1	@JohnDebes oof yeah i'll assume driving from now on.
1	@JohnDebes @FlippersPizzaUS @GaylordPalms By what mode of conveyance?
1	@bradpholden @dalcantonJD @astronomeara @astronomolly Real people! Cirque de Soliel I think? Juggling  turned into acrobatics later.
1	@dalcantonJD @astronomeara @astronomolly Here is the view from my room (you're welcome): https://t.co/NkOKYunLCv
1	@JedidahIslerPhD @kellecruz @kevinschawinski Yes  &amp; public areas have free wifi. Should've specified for *in-room* wifi
1	@ashpags @iva_momcheva @johngizis @eblur27 @Summer_Ash @jegpeek @janagrc Yes  for @startorialist #TshirtTuesday of course! ;)
-1	@jegpeek Stalled at Step 0! Safety pins &amp; stitch witchery it is. CC @ashpags @erinleeryan @rhaegal @kellecruz
1	@jegpeek @kellecruz @ashpags @rhaegal I could also bring jewelry findings &amp; tools....
1	We're hacking fabric posters! @jegpeek  are you bringing the sewing machine? #aas227  https://t.co/2DRGLOgVvb
1	@jegpeek @ashpags What were we talking about?
-1	@jegpeek @ashpags But the method was genius: wrap in cardboard  tape kitchen towel as handle. Only problem was baffled German security.
1	@jegpeek @ashpags Internationally.
-1	@jegpeek @ashpags Confession: I once transported a computer tower as carry-on luggage. It was 2000 &amp; I was poor.
1	@jegpeek @ashpags If it were me I'd say yes  but since it's you I say doooooooo iiiiiiiiiiit! ;)
1	@ashpags @jegpeek I'll bring safety pins! We'll need scissors  too... Anyone checking a bag?
-1	@vrooje Me  too  but the @startorialist poster last year was very image heavy so I think it'll be awesome. No more ink-wasting-guilt!
1	Glancing at @TrueSciPhi I noticed me  @sarahkendrew  &amp; @carolune are earliest adopters among female astros &gt;1k on Twitter. Neat! #dotastro
1	@reneehlozek Bummer  but yay!!! Go get 'em  Professor Hlozek!
1	Everyone's bringing StarWomen shirts to #AAS227 right? @reneehlozek @iva_momcheva @johngizis @eblur27 @Summer_Ash @jegpeek @ashpags @janagrc
1	@ashpags @startorialist @Summer_Ash You took a photo! ... Why did't we take a proper photo?!
1	Pretty cool that a @Lottie_dolls is on the #ISS! Even more cool if she weren't the only woman there right now. https://t.co/eWQBNeAnVO
1	Tons of @startorialist posts today! Prepare for the RTs in 3... 2... 1... 🚀
1	@startorialist Attn: @kellecruz
1	@mikamckinnon Is there a cure??? ('Where can I get some of these placebos?!')
1	@mikamckinnon PCL! I like that it has a TLA ;)
1	The real reason to study diffuse gas is not mass  but formation of stars &amp; galaxies. --@jegpeek
1	On images of diffuse hydrogen: 'It looks so interesting because there's a lot of information in there' --@jegpeek
1	Astronomy has standard candles (known intrinsic brightness)  @jegpeek uses standard crayons: objects with known colors.
1	Beautiful slide on dust by @eblur27!  @jegpeek https://t.co/ncVYy5ScXT
1	Accepted fact: most of the baryonic ('normal' or non-dark matter) matter in the Universe is diffuse gas *between* galaxies! @jegpeek
-1	And he already scored irony points for writing his Twitter handle@on the chalkboard. @jegpeek
1	Today @jegpeek is visiting @AMNH astronomers to talk about his work on the diffuse Universe. He wins for earliest reference: Ptolmey (155).
1	@sondy @Summer_Ash I am totally lobbying @kellecruz to have us be a part of @ScienceBetter!
1	@kejames She's probably used to being fangirled by kids  but I imagine it takes a while to get used to the adult scientists ;)
1	@kejames !!!!!! I saw her at a Timbers game w/ her wife (plays for the Thorns)  &amp; it took all my willpower not to fangirl. Kinda wish I had!
1	@brianwolven Yes  like that! It easier that I thought. Although it would be nice if the text margins were also a circle...
1	@PeterDEdmonds @startorialist Thanks so much! Means a lot  especially from fellow scientists.
1	@StartsWithABang @Summer_Ash (Can we do something about this astrofashion dark energy?)
1	@StartsWithABang @Summer_Ash I've seen them somewhere before  but not posted/drafted yet. Thanks!
1	@ashpags @Summer_Ash @erinleeryan Also the day @jegpeek came up with the name @startorialist according to my DMs! ⭐️💖😍
1	@PenguinGalaxy Just a short convo with the actors &amp; audience afterwards. Very nice  but a hard act to follow!
1	@PenguinGalaxy I think liberty might have been taken w/ interactions  but it was wonderful to see personalities &amp; stories brought to life.
1	@PenguinGalaxy I don't think it was  but I don't remember the name (Shapley I would have remembered...). The guys are credited as #1  2  &amp; 3
1	@PenguinGalaxy Yes! Also Pickering  Russell  &amp; a 3rd guy. (Try waiting/reloading link? Mine loaded after a second.)
-1	@astronomolly You're hired! I'm so bad at galaxies ;) @startorialist @BeckyQoF @Etsy
1	@kellecruz @Summer_Ash @janerrigby @astronomeara Wait yeah no I don't need help totally fine lalala I can't hear you!!!!!1!!
1	@astronomeara @Summer_Ash @kellecruz @janerrigby Go on....
1	@JPMajor @startorialist Thanks! What was the image you used? (My wallet is glad that doesn't exist anymore!)
1	@JPMajor 'had printed up'? Tell me more! Can I post to @startorialist?
1	@StarTalkRadio Oh  thanks! I do on my other accounts  @startorialist &amp; @astronomyontap :)
1	@mcnees two clips are here: https://t.co/cmxFD6UQif Not sure if the full episode will be online.
1	@UpportunityU Absolutely! Can I post your photo to @startorialist? Where is the hat from?
1	My necklace is c/o @EEJewellery (space shuttle!) and my bracelet is by @muhLISuhjewelry (Butterfly Nebula!) #StarTalkTV
1	Yay  @startorialist shout out!!!! #StarTalkTV
1	Mentored by @AstroAdric while working with #BDNYC I should add. @AllPlanets @PlanetImager @SETIInstitute
1	@LauraJaneGrace you might just be mentioned on #StarTalk on @NatGeoChannel this Sunday  just sayin...
1	@kevinschawinski Yup. They've talked constantly during class all semester  and I've asked them to stop many times.
1	@mcnees Do you follow @metasimpsons? It embiggens the smallest tweet.
1	@mcnees B-oof-urns?
1	Both @Summer_Ash &amp; I have (multiple?) full-time jobs  but you wouldn't think it with our prolific @startorialist posting! ⭐️🔥⭐️
1	@mattkenworthy @Astro_Wright @cosmos4u @JohnDebes @steinly0 Decade? Century?! Never?!?!? Who knows!!!!
1	@mattkenworthy @Astro_Wright @cosmos4u @JohnDebes @steinly0 I am totally starting a betting pool for J1407 vs KIC 8462852! Match of the...
1	@astrokiwi @AstroKatie @sarahkendrew @jegpeek @astrofrog Oh. Good. God. I've never heard of this before and now 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1	@aussiastronomer Ha! I always wondered where terminology came from for the shoes (usually I say 'heels'  but these are specifically pumps)
1	@startorialist @vafarmboy @evoque It is the least useful  most awesome purse I own. 🚀😜
1	@merrdiff @GeekGirlCon @dustchick @see_the_sky @SolarDawnB Lovely to see @StarstuffShirts &amp; @w00ki33 designs! &amp; the people of course :)
1	@the_n_nicole Will you be our @startorialist correspondent? Eagerly awaiting photos!
1	Hey  Hollywood! I'm in the database of the @SciEntEx now - call me  we'll talk science!
1	@KarenLMasters @startorialist @Spoonflower And I second @CelestialBuddy recommendation - they are worth every penny!
-1	@KarenLMasters @startorialist Sorry I'm late to the party! There is Jupiter fabric on @Spoonflower: https://t.co/chsam9VE5T
1	@mcnees @BadAstronomer You can by emailing Laura (see my TL)
1	@owlice @startorialist I DIDN'T KNOW MY LIFE WAS INCOMPLETE UNTIL NOW.
1	@mcnees Awareness of cognitive dissonance does lead to learning. Thank you for listening.
1	.@seanmcarroll @mcnees Not cognitive dissonance  actually  but a well-known ploy of predators to gain trust/sympathy.
-1	@astronomolly @StartsWithABang @niais @Pillownaut @astroengine @dalcantonJD Sure  senior faculty. I know grads/postdocs confronted him.
1	@StartsWithABang @niais @Pillownaut @astroengine @dalcantonJD Lots of people stepped in  but none was powerful enough to make him stop.
1	@hubbahubble @berkeleyjess @astrojohnjohn Thank you.
1	@Summer_Ash IKR?! We should start a shared @startorialist closet....
1	@startorialist @GirlsWillBeHQ I think @wandsci's kids might like some of these designs!
1	@aussiastronomer @startorialist @Gap Pic for the blog  please? :)
1	Attn: @POTUS  @FLOTUS  @VP  @DrBiden  @SpeakerBoehner  @NSF  etc! #astronomy #science  https://t.co/cjZd38vk92
1	@astrobellatrix @eilatg @kevinschawinski That was for their discovery  this is for discovering they have mass?
1	I'm RTing @startorialist frequently this week as we promote our #scicomm survey: you've been warned! Take the survey: http://t.co/3itpSzoBbS
-1	I sat down to write one @startorialist post &amp; ended up with 10 new drafts. I think I have a problem.
1	@aussiastronomer Props for using his past self as an example though!
-1	@aussiastronomer I read this backward and was VERY concerned until I saw the #badtalk was intentional!
1	@astronomyblog @w00ki33 More info here: https://t.co/x37Fy6PAnC
1	@ashpags @Summer_Ash @startorialist Would you believe I just got one in Ireland?!? So summer can have that one! 🎁😘💖
1	@merrdiff Yup  @ruthangus mentioned binaries as a contaminant! But most binaries are wide enough to be useful I think.
1	.@NASAKepler has allowed us to study the *population* of exoplanets for the first time  &amp; @ruthangus studies its dependence on stellar age.
1	.@ruthangus is taking a break from #AstroHackWeek to tell us about her research on stellar ages &amp; rotation @AMNH! @NASAKepler is the 'star'!
1	@phildelio @startorialist Nice! I'd estimate half my nerdy t-shirts are from @PercivalLowell!
1	@StartsWithABang @Summer_Ash Ha! Almost the polar opposite - she's LCDR in the U.S. Navy!
1	@Summer_Ash @StartsWithABang It did! We weren't sure  then we found another pic... I think I fixed it in another post? Oh well! ;)
1	@StartsWithABang @Summer_Ash But... it's actually my twin sister! No  really!!!
1	Thank you  @IStandWithAhmed  for making a @NASA t-shirt a symbol of acceptance as well as awesomeness!
1	@Summer_Ash @startorialist I loved watching these!!!
1	@natemccrady @astronomeara @johannateske @niais Aww  nuts. But you can tell the colors apart on your version?
1	@astronomeara @johannateske @niais Last comment: @kellecruz has students use them on screens and/or color their own!
1	@astronomeara @johannateske @niais @natemccrady (Doesn't print nearly as neon as it looks on my screen  but I kinda wish it did.)
1	@astronomeara @johannateske @niais Mine's a different color palate... Better for colorblind maybe? (@natemccrady?) http://t.co/EMpfGND36e
1	Class 2 of my @STARtorialist semester: bracelet w/ @NASA_Hubble image of NGC 6302 by @muhLISuhjewelry! http://t.co/PS5SnYPYHT
1	I love the bunny suit dancing! https://t.co/zupAC1SSHJ @JHUAPL @NewHorizons2015 #PlutoFlyBy via @PlanetDr &amp; @seackiss
1	I'm also starting out subtle w/my STARtorialism (@EEJewellery today  c/o)  planning to ramp it up over the semester! http://t.co/qfc8s2on9I
1	Excited to start my fifth (whoa) year at @csinews! Back to #Astro101  with a 100% more @startorialist wardrobe. http://t.co/p5JUltgh4k
-1	@mcnees They're missing 'STARtorialist' &amp; 'STARtorialist enabler'! ;)
1	@IAU_org Any comments on closing remarks by Incoming General Secretary Benvenuti?
1	@hormiga @kejames @ProfLikeSubst Agreed  unfortunately. Finding good pre-submission reviewers is important but challenging networking task.
1	Pleasure to film with Donna Hanover at @AMNH today! Look for this @startorialist outfit on @cunytv in December. http://t.co/wZdo5xbMMk
1	@Mad_Science_Guy @AMNH It's there  just under the floor unless we're using it! :)
1	@pkgw @AstroCaroline @jfaherty @kellecruz Bonus points to the first person who gets a tattoo of one of them! ;) 💪🏼 (I would I f I were Joe!)
1	My Twitter accounts collide this week as I host an @astronomyontap event featuring awesome @startorialist designers! http://t.co/MWWRFh2uSK
1	Two of my summer research students wore #astrofashion for their presentations! @startorialist http://t.co/m5hpAGT5D8
1	@Astro_Wright @astrojohnjohn @hubbahubble ESO WASP/HARPS press release from 2010.
1	@kevinschawinski @w00ki33 Get this one  too! http://t.co/hS0MNiAbsq #sorrynotsorry
1	@kevinschawinski All of @w00ki33's designs are here: http://t.co/ufDWjbAaMp
1	Quick search tells me yes  retrograde planet is a hot Jupiter w/ more distant  massive companion. @astrojohnjohn @Astro_Wright @hubbahubble
1	Astronomers: are there multi-exoplanet systems with both prograde &amp; retrograde planets? @astrojohnjohn @Astro_Wright @hubbahubble
1	@PeterDEdmonds @DrMRFrancis Probably! NRAO press release I saw had a whole paragraph on BDs  but I'm not sure whether the object was one.
1	@DrMRFrancis I didn't mean to imply that! I think it's an interesting discussion.
1	@DrMRFrancis It's great to see a discussion of the terms so thanks for that! These are pet peeves of mine.
-1	@DrMRFrancis On the other hand  Jupiter is in no way  shape  or form a failed brown dwarf  because Jupiter formed like a planet.
1	@DrMRFrancis It's an appropriate description for a free-floating brown dwarf (I.e.  one that formed like a star).
1	.@DrMRFrancis Besides  we astronomers love brown dwarfs even if we they are 'failed' stars: http://t.co/9baYYA8XfE ;) @knitted_bd
-1	.@DrMRFrancis I'm in favor of 'failed star' especially bc it makes more sense to distinguish BDs from planets by formation rather than mass.
1	@PlanetDr (That account plagiarizes  according to @GradElitist)
1	@NoisyAstronomer @Summer_Ash You can borrow this for starters! Inspired by @reneehlozek  made by @Alex_Parker http://t.co/IRbDNbQvbG
1	@johannateske @startorialist @jazztronomy @brizbby Did I see it on Facebook maybe? Even the acronym would help.
1	@hubbahubble @IBJIYONGI @astroprofhoff @dalcantonJD @Stardustspeck Not me  either. I hope to follow along on twitter tho!
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy Husband looked at plants I weeded &amp; did't see anything obvious. I have half a mind to bag it all up and drag it to doctor!
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy Unfortunately I react badly to steroids. I wish I could tolerate them enough for them to work!
1	@Mad_Science_Guy Calling a dermatologist today. I know I'm pretty allergic to everything environmental  but this is over the top.
1	@DrRubidium 'X was just joking'
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy Sources online says it can take 2-3 days  @berkemeyerjj said up to 2 weeks. :/ I'm washing all my clothes just in case.
1	@Mad_Science_Guy Okay  whew. This is most definitely a very delayed reaction. I do like ruling things out at the very least.
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy I did have a mark with dark spots before the rash/blisters got worse... I'll look into it.
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy Not really... Are you thinking Mosquitos? We have a ton. This started like lots of bad bites  but got worse
1	@Mad_Science_Guy Oh I'm doubling down on  Benadryl  Allegra  and every topical known to humankind.
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy No woods  but I weeded a very overgrown part of my yard two weeks ago. And I'm allergic to everything environmental :/
1	@Mad_Science_Guy @UrbanAstroNYC I definitely have blisters  and it's been four days. I'll look into sumac more. Thanks!
1	@DavidBflower Thanks! I've seen three doctors with different diagnoses  hence my paranoia...
1	We posted all the @MaisonValentino universe print we could find at @startorialist today! https://t.co/U9LBdyCfkQ
1	@mmmegan Awww! I hate to hear this from awesome people like you. You might like @astronomyontap &amp; @startorialist #shamelessselfpromotion

1	@WWTelescope @aagie @astrojonathan Apparently going to a panorama of the Apollo 12 landing site on the Moon works!
1	Any @WWTelescope folks know how to get complete black so projectors can stay on? Still constellation lines somehow... @aagie @astrojonathan
1	@merrdiff Was this Kathy by any chance? Fellow UCLA grad! :)
1	@Annaleen sunny dogs on a road trip! http://t.co/uep9iP5bvV
1	@20tauri Any chance you can visit NYC on Aug13? I'd still love to have you  speak at @astronomyontap  &amp; it's a special @startorialist event!
1	OUTBOUND FROM PLUTO!!! https://t.co/roHqQ5A1vH @acapellascience
1	ICYMI: @acapellascience made a brilliant new song &amp; video for @NewHorizons2015's #PlutoFlyby! https://t.co/roHqQ5A1vH
1	@acapellascience Don't worry  I'm mostly kidding. :) Great work!!!!!!!
1	@LeMoustier @astrokiwi @Alex_Parker I bet @startorialist knows how to make this happen! ;)
1	@trueanomalies @Summer_Ash @startorialist Thanks!!! 💖
1	@eteq @astrofrog @biphenyl You usually have to request one as grant PI  typically many limitations. I should say more paperwork *upfront*.
1	@astrofrog @eteq Many institutions have 'purchase cards' for spending grant money - more paperwork  but no fronting/reimbursement!
1	@marshallperrin @Astro_Wright @StellarPlanet @jfaherty Never tell us the odds!  Seriously tho  another transiting ring system'd be AWESOME.
1	@labroides Seriously  the world needs @startorialist for marine bio! Start by thinking of a nice punny portmanteau...
1	@demitrimuna The ones I've been to have been awesome! I'll probably miss this one  but I'm thinking about the Lincoln show in July...
-1	@demitrimuna I'm missing tonight (in Montreal!)  but I will be back on Sunday... Which album are they playing?
1	@UrbanAstroNYC @IntrepidMuseum 👏👏👏
1	@labroides @Odysseyblog Marine bio needs a @startorialist equivalent! (You have some gorgeous @MaisonValentino collections to start with...)
1	@da_neekster @Summer_Ash @startorialist Reminds me: can you send me roller derby pics? Working on a big post!
-1	@merrdiff Sorry  it was @NASA: http://t.co/qZBMtwvaIT @NSF has this page: https://t.co/SksKY444nH
1	@merrdiff I think there is one for @NSF now...
1	One last tweet: @Summer_Ash is tweeting from #IA2015 for @STARtorialist which is making me very happy 💖
1	@michelle_lmc @runnersworld @saucony WOW!!!!!!! Awesome!!!!!
1	@aoifemcl It is! That has put the biggest smile on my face! You might like @startorialist  too - my small ways of normalizing women in STEM.
1	@UrbanAstroNYC @Summer_Ash @ashpags @jegpeek @reneehlozek Me either!
1	@verbiscer @tedstryk @lukedones Sure. I know the "clean inning" idea is widespread  but no idea if it's based in fact.
-1	@lukedones (So bad at holding runners)
1	@lukedones If I had to guess  Lester is _so_ bad with people on base and the perception is relievers do better starting an inning.
1	@LDMay Ross is (obviously) the grizzled veteran... I think he's retiring after the World Series.
1	@jerry_drake @DrPhiltill And it'll be hard to tell if it's there until arrival (and even then it'll take some doing to detect).
1	@jerry_drake @DrPhiltill It's possible ice could be present in some of these objects  but it'll be deep down.
1	@jerry_drake @DrPhiltill Er...as you note in your second tweet. I should wait before responding. :)
-1	@jerry_drake @DrPhiltill Bound water as in OH in clay minerals will be there. H2O as in ice is going to be very tough to find.
-1	@DrPhiltill @jerry_drake For typical temps at 1 AU  it's 100s of meters loss per My. For typical NEO sizes/lifetimes  most likely ice free.
1	@cathomas09 Congrats on your great marathon performance! :)
1	@PlanetDr #blessed
1	@PlanetDr &lt;quickly checks previous several hours of tweets&gt;
1	@LDMay There are so  so many ways to have a good baseball game.  But someone will eventually score  even if it takes all damn night. :)

1	@Alex_Parker @PlanetDr @spacejammie @lukedones But we were not allowed to see what was generated for us.

-1	@cathomas09 @lukedones My posts on sci.astro were non-canonical. I suspect many of my tweets will be judged so as well...
1	@Paladin1969 @brianwolven @lukedones Plaid.
1	@nepetro Nope! ARM-IT.
1	@brianwolven @lukedones The metadata for any songs downloaded from my music blog has the genre as "Noise".
1	@lukedones There's a distinction to be made between the Andy Rivkin Published Canon and the Andy Rivkin Cinematic Universe.
1	@nepetro Not that I heard!
1	@nepetro You don't want photos?
1	@lukedones Hey  I'm just reporting.
1	@lukedones That's the public talk associated with this meeting  though the conference per se at the University of Montreal not McGill.
1	@SNMilam If all went to plan  I should have had some @SOFIAtelescope data taken for me a week or so ago!
-1	Tonight's reception is next to an iconic if melancholy Montreal icon. #NousAmours (attn @nepetro @rivkin) https://t.co/8zWfKTm0P6
1	@henrycobb Ooh. Good question. Her talk was only our Solar System. I have no doubt somebody will try   not sure if GTO for them or not.
1	@Paladin1969 I'm not making a value judgment  just a characterization of "fries plus toppings" food. :)
-1	@elakdawalla @tedstryk And the worst parts of reddit are vile as anywhere on the open internet (admittedly  Twitter is also in the running).
1	@decaelus That's a bit obscure. ;)
1	@PlanetDr &lt;3
1	@PlanetDr I'd been practicing Tay-Tay for this event for a little while  not that it was obvious.
1	@PlanetDr @EllenStofan :D
1	@jtuttlekeane @elakdawalla It was competitively selected.  Seems like something that could/should have been mentioned in the proposal.
1	@decaelus Bodega Bar. 5:30  I believe.
-1	@cathomas09 I suspect we both would.
1	@cathomas09 I would ask you to serve as Secretary of Excellence.
1	@brianwolven @sondy @ct_la I don't suspect anyone would stop a non-attendee spectator. I think performances are reserved for attendees.
1	@sondy @ct_la Rules?
1	@CarlyHowett @radjanirad Aren't you two supposed to be in a meeting together?
1	@omcintyre Legit.
1	@cathomas09 @NASAWebb @SNMilam I'll be right there?
-1	I think I can hear @verbiscer screaming from here.
1	@megschwamb @grierja The pleasure of course was ours! :)
1	@megschwamb @grierja We've arrived! We have a table near the door.
1	@cathomas09 And I suppose I'll. E seeing you and  @SNMilam for at least some of tomorrow...
1	@cathomas09 @SNMilam @verbiscer @megschwamb @grierja @PlanetDr I'm triple booked at various times but will keep you posted!
1	@SNMilam @verbiscer @cathomas09 attn. :) https://t.co/tC5nf1sQyK
1	@megschwamb @grierja Sounds good! And it looks like you'll get us both. :)
1	@megschwamb @grierja Jen may keep napping but I'm game. When are you thinking?
1	@megschwamb Assuming we count as "cool" for these purposes. ;)
1	@megschwamb We're staying at the Hilton. We've been napping off our super-early start to the day but I might be coaxed into getting a round.
1	@deepbluedot Thank you  sir! :)
1	@cathomas09 @sir_galahead I only lost about 10 minutes  I eventually work around it. But I did feel dumb. :P
1	@TheyMayBeParted @nepetro It'd be a massive amount of work  though. Especially if done a la The Diary of Myles Thomas.
1	@TheyMayBeParted @nepetro "Another take of 'Dig A Pony' breaks down."
1	@TheyMayBeParted @nepetro Project for 2019: Live-tweet Get Back sessions exactly 50 years later. With scheduled tweets  presumably.
1	@sir_galahead @cathomas09 Those would only have been useful if I could draw a box on the data viewer with them.
1	@radjanirad @barbylon You can't be late to this party--it wasn't going to start without you! ;)
1	@sir_galahead @cathomas09 You know what I could have used?  A middle mouse button. :P
1	Was passed the baton by @cathomas09  am now pointing a multi-ton piece of equipment at a city-sized piece of rock using my laptop.
1	@jimcook310 @nepetro @TheyMayBeParted Fascinatingly  here's the relevant part of the 1968 review from Rolling Stone… https://t.co/StugPYCP9W
1	@lukedones Helicopter?
1	@a20261 I don't disagree that's what he'll be  but he should be first ballot. Especially since he's a good shot for 3000 hits.
-1	@PlanetDr @barbylon This is William of Ockham's suspicion  along with "voting for Hillary and not admitting it".
-1	@starstryder They apparently did this with Dole in '96  not because he was controversial but because he was obviously going to lose.
1	@brianwolven @OtherOrbScience @PlanetDr Too subtle.  This is Twitter. ;)
-1	@brianwolven @PlanetDr No  no. Dehumanizing him makes it someone else's problem. He's a GOP  USA  male folks (etc etc) problem.
-1	@PlanetDr Oh  he is a very  very sorry human being.
1	@gregzink Brookline  I think. :)
1	@Paladin1969 On the contrary  I'm kind of figuring it's much  much later than it should have been.
1	@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon We have to get things signed/approved by various managers  but that's true of everyone everywhere.
1	@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon Oh!  It was when I was at MIT.  Not APL.  Postdocs can propose for whatever at APL.
1	@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon This was 10-15 years ago  might be different now. Might have been specific unenthusiastic people involved.
-1	@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon Proposing to programs other than the 2 I came with was a non-starter. But also unnecessary for my funding.
-1	@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon ...and I definitely got the sense that reproposing to PGG was going to be a hassle. But I pushed through.
1	@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon It's a bit more nuanced than 140 char can hold  but my PGG was ending...
1	@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon And even then there were excuses/reasons I shouldn't propose to the programs where I had expiring grants.
1	@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon I had 2 grants when I came there  and made keeping/reproposing a condition of accepting the job.
-1	@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon At MIT I wasn't even a postdoc--I was a research scientist. Same rules  regardless.
1	@spacejammie @PlanetDr @barbylon At both LPL and MIT I needed permission of the faculty to propose. It was pro forma-ish  but not automatic.
1	@PlanetDr @barbylon @spacejammie And the rise/spread of soft money career paths is at odds with that kind of postdoc structure.
1	@PlanetDr @barbylon @spacejammie "I don't want clever young scientists competing with me for grant money" so not allowed to PI.
-1	@PlanetDr @barbylon @spacejammie Not that people would say that if challenged  but that thinking is behind the whole system.
1	@PlanetDr @barbylon @spacejammie I think it's part of the outdated thinking-Postdocs are "supposed to" find faculty jobs or leave the field.
1	@OtherOrbScience @spacejammie Yeah  we do too.  And the Brown alum to LPL alum ratio is getting out of balance...
-1	@darth The 90's pop-grunge band is very sad to be unrecognized.
1	@planetpatman @amytoast @jgrplanets Per @hauck blue text = Ocean World  white text = other body for context.
1	@JLGalache IPEWG  which native English speakers pronounced "Ippy-wig" and others pronounced "Eye-pewg".

1	@astrokiwi @shaka_lulu @david_kipping I don't know what Isopod Universe is  but looking up "isopods" I hope I'm not already living in one.
1	@shaka_lulu @astrokiwi @david_kipping Nah.  They keep us honest solar system rock jockeys from getting any telescope time. ;)
1	@shaka_lulu @astrokiwi @david_kipping And I honestly have no idea (asteroid astronomer) what biosignatures are on Europa or Enceladus.
1	@shaka_lulu @astrokiwi @david_kipping Sure. I'm conflating a bit  but most layfolk think Spock/Worf/ET not tardigrades when thinking aliens.
1	@astrokiwi @david_kipping @shaka_lulu I think there are loads of reasons unrelated to life to love and study the universe around us. :)
1	@astrokiwi @david_kipping @shaka_lulu If life will mostly exist (probabilistically) where we can't interact  can we prove it's there?
1	@astrokiwi @david_kipping @shaka_lulu I think some people who are super-focused on astrobio are also super-focused on interacting with them.
1	@astrokiwi @david_kipping @shaka_lulu I assume someone is working on sci-fi about how we're just about the only surface-dwelling life? :)

1	@sondy @HiCommander @OtherOrbScience I don't see any Gedankenband swag up on that door.

1	@lukedones @nepetro Don't even.
1	@nepetro @lukedones We've been fans for ~25-30% of Red Sox history  it's not overwhelmingly crazy we'd've seen the best Red Sox player.
-1	@nepetro @lukedones DiMaggio missed age 28-30 seasons  Greenberg 30-33. Greenberg was MVP in 1940  DiMag in 1941 (admittedly infamously).
-1	@nepetro @lukedones Same argument is sometimes made for DiMaggio and Greenberg  though obviously not as strong a case.
-1	@nepetro @lukedones I agree--give him those seasons back it's absolutely no question. I assume this argument only looks at accrued stats.
-1	@lukedones And even so  Williams' career spanned integration and I'm not aware of an argument his hitting suffered.
1	@lukedones There is pretty much no real argument that Ortiz was better than Williams unless you put tons of weight on pre-integration issue.
1	@lukedones Yaz was probably better than Ortiz (I haven't looked up any stats).  Tris Speaker was unquestionably better.
1	@lukedones Manny Ramirez was better than Ortiz. Ortiz was often not even the best hitter in Boston's lineup  let alone ever.
-1	@PlanetDr Could be an intentional rebellious act by a Magritte fan.
1	@verbiscer @elakdawalla Mais oui. https://t.co/8giNaIsU6p

1	@nepetro @TheyMayBeParted I see another website that says they "visited" George and recorded there but they were not all in studio together.
1	@nepetro @TheyMayBeParted I didn't think they _were_ in the studio together for All Those Years Ago. I thought they mailed tapes around.
1	@lukedones It's inside every one of us  if we care to look for it.

1	@barbylon @spacejammie @PlanetDr Works for me. :)
1	@rafi0t @sondy Will do! I don't know how this asteroid mining thing will work out  but it may be a frequent stop for many of us!
1	@VealSlab Should have listened to you.
1	#ASIME2016 is now over  and was very interesting. Thanks to @amaragraps  @JLGalache et al for organizing!
1	@lukedones I have been finding the Grand Duchy delightful  even given an earlier than expected last call.
1	@brianwolven That seems to be tomorrow night's plan.
1	@JLGalache Oh dear.
1	I also note that @JLGalache is tweeting this at #ASIME2016  but I'm going to stick it out at #ASIME. :)
1	@JLGalache Know very few _among_the_NEOs_.  Plenty abundant in main belt.
1	.@JLGalache estimates current situation for NEA physical parameters at #ASIME https://t.co/gZqq9SUvfC
1	.@JLGalache There is no agency mandated to measure any of those things for NEOs* so it's all a bit catch as catch can. #ASIME
1	.@JLGalache "40 000 foot view" of the state of asteroid mining. What do you need to know to mine? Size/mass/composition/orbit.... #ASIME
-1	.@amaragraps #ASIME began as questions posed at @planetarysci retreat  grew into Luxembourg- and industry-sponsored workshop.
1	I've spotted a few folks at #ASIME including @martinselvis2 and America's Sweetheart Tim Swindle. No @JLGalache yet  though.
1	@prgrmr42 Unter der MilchigWei
1	@JayAlver @smod2016 But I'll cheerfully concede I hadn't considered the airburst = meteor argument so may be thinking of it wrong. :)
1	@JayAlver @smod2016 You can have a meteor without an airburst--meteor showers are basically sand eroding via atmospheric friction.
1	@JayAlver @smod2016 I'm thinking the airburst is more the impact than the meteor.
1	@JLGalache Yeah  I'm doing IAD-Frankfurt  then there straight to LUX.  I considered taking a train from Paris  but should work.
1	@JLGalache What route are you taking? I don't leave here until early evening and get there mid-morning tomorrow...
1	@Valgren6 @lukedones @ObservatoryCats In some circumstances they're fine  in others they're unwelcome.
1	@brianwolven Why not both?
1	@lukedones I'm moving closer and closer to having my GSA talk center around an idea of somebody else's that I don't quite buy as true.
1	@lukedones @amytoast @brianwolven @hauck @yifer Infinite Sadness  indeed.
1	@amytoast @brianwolven @lukedones @hauck @yifer I'm just interested in whether people think the Pumpkins sold out with Siamese Dream.

1	@OtherOrbScience @lukedones The inimitable Tom Burbine has this coming out  not sure of level: https://t.co/2Wx6wSGwwA
1	@brianwolven But soon.  Early next week  I'd say.
1	@brianwolven Because it isn't _quite_ decorative gourd season.
1	@brianwolven Would you rather me go into the well-known spiel about it being decorative gourd season?
1	@PlanetSabine @PlanetDr @brianwolven @AnnaUnderTheSun @HannahSus Welcome to Charm City.
-1	@PlanetDr @AnnaUnderTheSun @HannahSus @PlanetSabine Amazing show. Best drama I've ever seen. However: super violent and often disturbing.
1	@brianwolven @planetdr @annaunderthesun @hannahsus @planetsabine I WASNT GOING TO MENTION THAT  NO BRIAN  I WASNT
1	@PlanetDr @AnnaUnderTheSun @HannahSus @PlanetSabine Also  I assume we need to chip in and buy her all five seasons of The Wire on DVD.
1	@PlanetDr @AnnaUnderTheSun @HannahSus @PlanetSabine Surely we can point her to the Trash Wheel though  right?
-1	@prgrmr42 It does make one wonder whether R2 is taunting him about his status in all the beeps that we don't understand (but 3PO does).
1	@prgrmr42 In the Pr*ls R2 shows up  is recognized as a hero  and sticks around to be useful. C3PO is much less independent.
1	@prgrmr42 Oddly  I feel like R2-D2 was never actually "owned" in the narrative in the way that C3PO was.
1	@HannahSus @PlanetDr @PlanetSabine @AnnaUnderTheSun I never got a brochure. I was just handed a Jaz drive and given a badge.

1	@JessicaNoviello @astrotweeps I see one grad student on the past schedule. Good question for @megschwamb et al  though!
-1	@TheyMayBeParted @nepetro Whether they figured they'd lose their edge if they rested  or if such a break might have staved off burnout?
1	@TheyMayBeParted @nepetro It does make one wonder about whether it even occurred to them to take a break.
-1	@TheEarthStory Yeah  it was an empty offer/threat on my part.
-1	@lukedones Yep  I can't find it either. :/
1	@lukedones It was a response to a similarly named Zolotov paper  IIRC.

1	@prgrmr42 ...and the 3B had time to consider and then throw out Ortiz at 1st.
1	@prgrmr42 That's the thing--1st and 2nd  ball went to the pitcher  who hesitated and threw to 3rd for the out...
1	@prgrmr42 Don't know if you're watching  but I've never seen a double play like that before.  He was like the Usain Bolt of slowness there.
-1	@tedstryk Then we are in violent agreement! :)
1	@tedstryk But that's not unreasonable given the likely time horizon of such a mission.... :)
1	@tedstryk I think actual operations of an interstellar mission that's trying to look at the planets is under-considered.
1	@tedstryk I completely agree  but it'd also be a huge issue if you're not going to slow down after spending all that time/$$ to get there.
1	@tedstryk ...though of course such a mission would cross 1 AU distance in something like 5-10 hours unless they slowed down...
1	@tedstryk I was imagining LORRI on a Proxima Centauri mission earlier today. I think it'd get 40 pixels across Earth from 1 AU away...
1	@tedstryk I thought NH had an outside chance  but figured Galileo probably had the best resolution.
1	@tedstryk Pioneer 11 doesn't still hold the record for highest spatial resolution on Jupiter  though  I'd imagine?

1	@nepetro @TheyMayBeParted And it would be something like Bono appears to do a song with Macca and that's what they do.
1	@nepetro @TheyMayBeParted You know  I could actually see him trying that one. It's a quirky choice in the right way.

-1	@ltelkins @spacejammie @AmyMainzer Well  don't feel guilty.  Just go give everybody the ass kicking they deserve. :)
1	@ltelkins @spacejammie @AmyMainzer No you don't. ;)
1	@spacejammie @AmyMainzer @ltelkins I mean  I wouldn't know firsthand.  It's just what I hear. https://t.co/DIBsNtmPt1
1	@spacejammie @AmyMainzer Discovery PIs often do that sort of thing once they get into Phase A to stay away from paparazzi. Ask @ltelkins.
1	@spacejammie Maybe @AmyMainzer was in costume? I hear that's an LA kind of thing. Or going incognito?
1	@lukedones I had a definite urge to walk around the Trump casino in Vegas and yell at babies when I was recently there.
1	@prgrmr42 Me neither. :)
1	@prgrmr42 I can't say with precision since I didn't see last night's speech  but I'm guessing Nixon's Checkers speech was also better.

-1	@FakeUnicode @StarzanPlanets @brianwolven I went to a dinner/re-enactment at Invisible Times once  but the show was underwhelming. :(
1	@sondy @Alex_Parker @erinleeryan That's the plan. We're making sure it's not required  but we certainly hope for Goldstone  Arecibo  and GB.
-1	@lukedones He's a monster.
1	@PlanetDr Correct  perhaps along with an email to project leadership explaining why they won't be exploiting you further.
-1	@cosettegilmour Retro? I bought that one new. :|
1	@cathomas09 And I just responded. :)
1	@cathomas09 Welcome back! We might touch base once you've gotten your feet back under you. :)
1	@prgrmr42 Other big  big gainers on my personal Dylan charts as I've aged: "Idiot Wind" and "Tangled Up in Blue".
1	@prgrmr42 Yep. "Maggie's Farm" went from something I'd skip as a teenager to something I seek out now...
1	@brianwolven @PlanetDr @sondy @Alex_Parker @elakdawalla @DrFunkySpoon I'll see what I can do. My DPS Open Mic set list is already full  tho.

1	@PlanetDr @HannahSus @enceladude I have "Recurring Hopkins Fancy Donut Grad Student Event" in my calendar starting next Friday. Valid?
1	@fcain @storybywill @prgrmr42 Came for the asteroid moons  left satisfied. :)
1	@Astro_Adept ...but others are ~50 AU away. And you'd have to wait ~10-15 years for them to be closer than from Earth. Tradeoffs.
1	@Astro_Adept It's also not necessarily clear how much help it would be--TNOs are ~40 AU away  at Saturn some of them are ~30 AU away...
1	@Astro_Adept That'd depend a lot on the details.  It is technically similar to Galileo/Cassini but without the planet to help you slow down.
1	@PlanetDr Tell me the thing he hasn't seen it do is give out free donuts and/or cocktails.

1	@Astro_Adept Here's a giant study from NASA. https://t.co/nwbgHNfrSP
1	@Astro_Adept Sure! :) Here's slide sets from proponents: https://t.co/VQ935Nh8fH https://t.co/zHMzaYZ8UI I'll see if I can find a paper...
1	@Astro_Adept Here's a non-technical article about possible missions: https://t.co/qopmH0KZ5v
1	@Astro_Adept Very true. Since Voyager 2 went by we can only observe them telescopically  though there are proposals to return.
1	@Astro_Adept @NatGeo Yep  on my mental list but I grabbed these first. :)
1	@Astro_Adept For instance: https://t.co/0ppMvbub7C  https://t.co/kgZDHEJMny  https://t.co/zsWVL3mLdu (not all equally huge discoveries)
-1	@dbindsch @starstryder The fact that "discovering water on Mars" is a planetary science punchline indicates you're not the only worrier.
1	@neilebowles Then turn around and say it should be funded because we think it's important.
-1	@neilebowles I understand  but I think that's a circular argument--we say it's important because we'll think it'll get funded...
1	@starstryder No single thing  but a few unrelated minor things in rapid succession added to a multi-decade unease moved me to tweet.
1	Attn @nepetro  https://t.co/pXgqvtcjrE
1	@MV_Paul You'd need to bring it or show it to someone with more experience than I have.  Were I a betting man  I'd bet against it  though...
1	@shannonmstirone @HopeJahren All in a day's work  ma'am. https://t.co/ntmQNCiDIZ
-1	@prgrmr42 I hated Ramirez  but he was absolutely one of the 4-5 best hitters I have ever seen while I've been a baseball fan.
1	@LDMay And IIRC  Nats fans had to be taught not to do it at first--they thought it was just what you do at baseball games. :)
1	@AstroCook @spacejammie @brianwolven @jtuttlekeane @AscendingNode @Alex_Parker It looks like it'll be ~7 between NF AOs.
1	@AstroCook @spacejammie @brianwolven @jtuttlekeane @AscendingNode @Alex_Parker That's the recommendation for Discovery. ~5 years for NF.
1	@spacejammie @brianwolven @AstroCook @jtuttlekeane @AscendingNode @Alex_Parker Not as often as the community has recommended.
1	@cosettegilmour Just keep thinking that. I'm sure others will set you straight ;)
-1	@cosettegilmour I have other connections that would get me there  but I unfortunately also have previous plans for that time...
1	@prgrmr42 @brianwolven @Wikisteff @PlanetDr @plutokiller JPL offers to extract the nickel and give it to you if you give them a dollar.
1	@Wikisteff @PlanetDr @brianwolven I may just add some more sand to this evening's cocktails to make up for it.
-1	@Wikisteff @PlanetDr Periodically a server grabs it just before the first sip and says "it's not quite right"  then returns with same thing.
1	@PlanetDr And?
1	@PlanetDr Fill highball 2/3 with water. Drop in 1 tsp of sand. Add single ice cube that snugly fits into glass. $30. Get a friend to pay.
1	@lukedones I will follow Mariano Rivera wherever he may lead me. I have a baseball bat already in my office.
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy @benjaminsharkey the response/reaction/reminiscence would be if it had been Rickey Henderson assaulting an ump instead. 2/2
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy @benjaminsharkey Absolutely. One of the most aggravating things about the Pine Tar Game to me is how different 1/2
1	@Mad_Science_Guy @benjaminsharkey Yeah  I see no reason for Bagwell to be excluded at all.
1	@Mad_Science_Guy @benjaminsharkey Yeah  I'd put them both in  and Clemens. But not Rose.
1	@Jane_MacArthur @MfNBerlin Make sure to see the archaeopteryx fossil in the back corner! :)
1	@Mad_Science_Guy A large fraction of North Americans use caffeine as an everyday PED. :)
1	@Mad_Science_Guy Yeah  that's the elephant in the room. I imagine it'll (continue to) mirror societal opinions toward drugs in general.
1	@gregzink And we certainly have different things that push our buttons. I have good friends I totally disagree with on A-Rod vs Pete Rose.
-1	@gregzink We (collectively) tolerate it in sports  in music  in politics  etc. Look at coverage of Lou Reed's death  for instance.
1	@Mad_Science_Guy I enjoy arguing baseball. :)  But I certainly respect those who think an intangible element may exist...
1	@Mad_Science_Guy Ortiz cleared 40 home runs 3 times  most recently in 2006. A-Rod did it 8 times  most rcently in 2007.
-1	@Mad_Science_Guy If you're a sabermetrics guy  A-Rod had 10 seasons with a higher WAR than Ortiz' best season.
1	@Mad_Science_Guy Serious question: In what aspect of the game do you think Ortiz was superior to A-Rod? Integrated over career  I mean.
1	Hmm. Maybe @PlanetDr will be gifted a souvenir... https://t.co/i9Gzhr6HF0
1	@cosettegilmour Oh  I'm not actually seeing Celine Dion. But she did sing it in the commercial for her show I saw.
1	@PlanetDr So  you wore it on your flight  then.
1	@PlanetDr #BlueJayPride #OrSomething
-1	@lukedones @amytoast Or a super-pretentious American sign maker?
1	@lukedones @amytoast Given "flavour" spelling and use of "corn" vs "maize"  this has to be in Canada  right?
1	@astrotweeps Um  "super fast" photons?  Einstein and Maxwell (among others) would have been interested. :)
1	@benjaminsharkey @DrMRFrancis @barbylon @planetpatman Well  you know what they say: Don't cry because he's gone. Smile because he was here.
1	@DrMRFrancis @barbylon @planetpatman His charisma was amazing. https://t.co/LGAbvrPxo3
1	@barbylon @DrMRFrancis @planetpatman I _know_ you've heard this one  here's the video: https://t.co/tV0njiYf3Z
1	@barbylon @DrMRFrancis Also note him tickling the ivories: https://t.co/8IWaIFHhVE
1	@barbylon @DrMRFrancis @jnspitale Of course.
1	@OtherOrbScience @barbylon Oh  that is true.
1	@barbylon @DrMRFrancis I have microblogged about the high esteem in which I held Prince's various talents on this very website.
1	@DrMRFrancis @barbylon His estate hasn't caught up: https://t.co/TvAt8lo68F
1	@prgrmr42 I agree it'd be better for him to drop out regardless of cause  but now these things have gained some level of "respectability".
-1	@prgrmr42 Sure. But not at _that_ level. Party leadership hoped they could let things fizzle instead of confront Trump. Here's the result.
-1	@prgrmr42 Or the Mexicans are rapists thing or the deporting Muslims thing or the Megan Kelly blood thing or "you can't control me so you wo

1	@prgrmr42 To my knowledge the book is not available in that particular packaging configuration. Perhaps the second edition?
-1	@prgrmr42 I will neither confirm nor deny that discussions took place between myself and Sensei Wu.
1	@PlanetDr Also minor planets. :)
1	@brianwolven @HopeJahren Would vegan Applebees make fungus tenders?
1	@RonBaalke @susanbellfilm I thought the suggestion was NaCl xtals within Zag came from Ceres  then delivered to Zag parent body?
-1	@HiCommander @sondy @MarsMaven @barbylon Don't give away the punchline!
1	@HiCommander @sondy @MarsMaven @barbylon Maybe you should also tell the toothbrush story.
1	@HiCommander @sondy @MarsMaven @barbylon I feel like I can guess the story. I feel like I was standing next to you.
1	@barbylon @brianwolven @HiCommander @spacejammie  &lt;look slowly comes across face&gt; "Um..my phone is buzzing" &lt;walks away unconvincingly&gt;
-1	@lukedones What is wrong with these people?
1	@lukedones My understanding is that it lived on the second floor?
1	@lukedones Already responded to him. :)
1	@Roy_Astro Understood.  Just trying to give some context to the reactions that surprised you.
-1	@Roy_Astro To the people who are steeping in it it's as obvious as the existence of gravity  and it's dismaying to hear it questioned.
-1	@Roy_Astro There is plenty of evidence of systemic racism  from individual experience through to large-scale history and data.
-1	@Roy_Astro Sure  I can absolutely see that is frustrating  though the comparison between those communities doesn't really hold.
1	@Roy_Astro I hope that makes some sense?
-1	@Roy_Astro Hence the implicit/explicit admonition to "do your own research". Constantly explaining oneself is exhausting work.
-1	@Roy_Astro That frustration is a real  well-founded emotion. It is good to want to learn more  but a burden to a small number of teachers.
-1	@Roy_Astro It is also exhausting for people in the relevant communities to always be on call to answer these Qs  even for the well meaning.
1	@Roy_Astro If you feel like reading  the Washington Post has tried to gather stats: https://t.co/pr5zBveDrJ
-1	@Roy_Astro Meanwhile  for political reasons  there has been no national database of deaths at the hands of the police.
-1	@Roy_Astro There is a long history of police power being used to terrorize minority communities in addition to more legitimate functions.
1	@Roy_Astro @PlanetDr For starters: the climate and history in the UK  where I gather you're from  is different from the USA.
1	@PlanetDr Guess what?
1	@PlanetDr I didn't know you were Belgian. ⊗
1	@notfroggie @lukedones I agree with that  too.
-1	@lukedones @notfroggie He can share an apartment with the guy deposed from Ukraine a couple of years ago. It'd be an Odd Couple reboot.
1	@notfroggie @lukedones Totally agree. The question is how many people he can get to agree with him.
1	@notfroggie @lukedones So if there's an unforecast difference like  say  higher minority turnout than expected  he'd claim fraud.
1	@notfroggie @lukedones He'd base that on any difference between polls and actual results. And as you note  polls can be hard.
-1	@notfroggie @lukedones The interpretations of this I've seen are that Trump is setting the stage to claim the final vote is fraudulent.
-1	@lukedones @eehouls Just like how Kerry demonstrated that his leading the Ohio exit polls incontrovertibly meant he took the state.
1	@K04PB2B @jtuttlekeane Phobos and Deimos formation (very recent theory)
1	@PlanetDr Ceres? :)
1	@brianwolven Yeah  that's what I saw. Does that include all the stuff like Tersiguels and the Pure Wine Cafe etc?
-1	@brianwolven Oh  this sounds terrible. :( I've seen pictures of floods there from decades ago  never dreamed they'd recur.
-1	@sondy @erinleeryan It was all the crowd could do not to just burst into tears  actually.
1	@astrotweeps Well  not just luck. :)
1	@lukedones I believe in math.
-1	@PlanetDr In the best case this election will be cathartic. An argument can be made that in the worst case it will be a different catharsis.
1	@PlanetDr @nadiamdrake A stopped watch can always be right.
1	@tedstryk Ooh. I remember that well. I was working as a postdoc for one of the team members--what an up and down day....

1	@PlanetDr #subtweet. ;)
1	@PlanetDr @niais &lt;noting to self&gt;
1	@michael_w_busch @astropuckett @MinorPlanetCtr @astrotweeps Oh  right you are! Adonis was lost (and was in Tintin) but was later found.
1	@MinorPlanetCtr @michael_w_busch @astrotweeps And Adonis is the only named but not numbered asteroid  IIRC?  Plus it's in a Tintin book!
1	@michael_w_busch @MinorPlanetCtr @astrotweeps 719 Albert? Unless you're asking something different?
1	@rdrimmel That seems very likely  yeah. Castillo-Rogez has done recent work on depleting Ceres' ice via impacts.

1	@alexwitze Do you think they know where I left all my Allen wrenches?
1	@PlanetDr @TychoGirl @megschwamb How about instead of you apologizing  I thank you instead? :)
1	@MarsMaven @HopeJahren @lukedones The first 3 G&amp;Ts were excellent. I imagine the next 3 were as good  though I'm less certain.
1	@MarsMaven @HopeJahren @lukedones Remind me to bring you to the lesbian hipster NASA dive bar in Houston for Islay gin and artisanal tonics.
1	@HopeJahren @lukedones So  are _you_ familiar with Red Grape Malt Duck  then (as a Midwestern Gen-Xer)? (Attn @Valgren6)
1	@lukedones @HopeJahren I'm having flights of South American wine to prepare for #ACM2017 and to show my admiration for our sister republics.

1	@alexwitze Can't disagree.
1	@cosettegilmour But it seems like they'd have to have _some_ connection  otherwise quoting worth in $$ would be misleading?
1	@cosettegilmour Well  that's an interesting question  and you've hit my economics limit. :)
1	@cosettegilmour Someone hasn't thought about whether the market value would remain the same after such a glut  though... ;)

1	@nepetro Yeah  I was going to head toward "when they were super well established they tried to use their fame for good".

-1	@cathomas09 Dislike
1	@jasonrdavis https://t.co/JlNgPpzYUS
1	@starstryder I see. :)  "non-simultaneous"?  That's not necessarily any better  though.  "non-immediate"?
1	@starstryder "archived"? Need you lump online forums and pre-recorded classes together?
1	@erinleeryan @PlanetDr  I think the (cynical) lesson from that is that when &lt;powerful special interest&gt; wants something  they find a way.
-1	@PlanetDr I've been rereading my Sci Am blog post from December 2012  and it still holds up very well.  And that's really unfortunate.
1	@asmuniz @rocketrepreneur @jasonrdavis Actually  I already see I'm probably misreading your question.
1	@asmuniz @rocketrepreneur @jasonrdavis I'm probably not the right person to respond  but other US missions should be going in 2021.

-1	@OtherOrbScience I honestly have no idea what to think. I believe you're right  but just having this conversation is insane.
1	@OtherOrbScience Oh  sure. I mean  realistically that particular worst-case scenario is pretty remote in its specifics.

1	@michael_w_busch @PlanetDr Sure.  I like the idea of a random policy postdoc being asked to review it rather than a head of state  tho.
1	@PlanetDr Who do you think would agree to review that paper?
1	@PlanetDr https://t.co/QT30ZDazdI
1	@PlanetDr Europa the icy satellite? Hmm. I'd really have to think about that one  actually.
1	@PlanetDr You're in Pasadena  right?  I bet Serina's house would be the top hit. :)
-1	@Shamrocketeer @barbylon @NASAGoddard She's not playing bass for you lot as well?
1	@PlanetDr I'm under the impression is that it was designed with Japan in mind  but the underlying point is quite the same.
1	@PlanetDr This was mentioned yesterday on here... https://t.co/IyJArTyhsp

-1	@brianwolven I evicted one of those last night. I figured it was best for everyone that way.

1	@PlutoBees @BadPhysics That'd be a reasonable working hypothesis  yeah. Someone would have to do the math  but maybe N2 or CO?
-1	@BadPhysics Of course  we wouldn't care about H2O collecting in those but maybe other more volatile materials?
-1	@BadPhysics I think all that's required is to be airless and relatively low obliquity. I bet Ganymede/Callisto have them as well. +

1	@exoplaneteer Looks like latecomers @kylebarbary and I will be out in Brooklyn... Anywhere to aim for/avoid? @brendonbrewer @ruthangus
1	@brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer @kylebarbary @ruthangus Looking at accommodation near you for #AstroHackWeek. Which borough should I aim for?
1	@brendonbrewer Oh yeah  that's right. #FML
1	@brendonbrewer You should have said "prior over datasets"
1	@exoplaneteer is here! We're out on the patio. @jefflcoughlin @shaka_lulu @jonathansick @chrislintott http://t.co/IbUxk12hj4
1	The SULI program summer interns at @SLAClab are giving some truly impressive research talks. Very hard to believe they are undergrads.
1	@philipbull Thanks  this is good to know. I guess I'll roll my own! :-)
-1	Wanted: 1 low-l spherical harmonic expansion of the Planck CMB map. Coefficiants must come with covariance matrix or equivalent. @philipbull
1	@apontzen @doddy_marsh @reneehlozek @philipbull I think it's more than that: computing evidence differences without the overall Pr(d)?
1	@doddy_marsh That's cool - especially how the live points arrange themselves between the models @brendonbrewer
1	@demitrimuna Thanks very much! We'll check this out - looks like a great place to start learning the ropes. @merrdiff
1	@cosmos4u December 2016  according to Hofmann.
-1	@demitrimuna @npr247 That does not mean that shaving in the name of diversity is in any way a sufficient response to the problem
-1	Thanks @apontzen! Ill let you know if anything comes of it. The random walk through hack space has only just begun @doddy_marsh @philipbull
1	@astronomyblog @astroduff @fringetracker Hah! Herds of zebra do indeed travel in single file. Often with nebulous wildebeest in tow :-)
1	@astronomyblog Cygnus! It's the direction we are moving in  as we go round the galaxy  and so it's the direction that the DM wind comes from
-1	@ickbat @brendonbrewer Hah! Busha and Wechsler were working on this then too (probably cited by Robotham). I joined in to invert the problem
-1	@brendonbrewer All the focus here is on the HST frontier fields and their mocks  is that what you're working on?
1	.@brendonbrewer Coe just asked about the possibility of learning basis sets from simulations; one issue is the realism of sims #IPMUlens
-1	@brendonbrewer Interesting: at the moment we are doing brute force/Laplace characterisation...
1	@Space_Mog Combined with CMB you can constrain dark energy parameters  like with BAO and SNe Ia and with similar precision (Suyu et al 2014)
-1	@Space_Mog Time delay lenses give you an absolute measure of distance  which at redshift 0.5 or so means mostly H0  with some Om
1	@Space_Mog Cosmography is the mapping of the universe (like geography)  or more particularly  the measurement of cosmological parameters
1	@R_Trotta I like to remember that there is a special circle of hell reserved for futurologists
-1	@kevinschawinski Kiessling *claimed* that she had no evil plans for an airship "observatory" but I guess one never  sees these things coming
1	Huge thanks to the organizers of #sciencehackday San Francisco 2014 - you created something special! http://t.co/ZJuAuXYfaR @arielwaldman
1	@jr_pritchard Cool! If I was reviewer  I'd want to see the plot that proves you can marginalize out the foregrounds. Pwn your degeneracies!
1	@arielwaldman Thanks! I'll give it a go. See you later @github @arfon
1	@astrotweeps Go on  say "hexagon" :-)
-1	@doug_burke @merrdiff @exoplaneteer I suspect for me the python3 tipping point will be the LSST DM stack release that first requires it...
1	@merrdiff @exoplaneteer @doug_burke I think we are all on the same page here :-) Bets for when we will be forced to adopt python3?
1	I'm still postponing moving to python3  but yes  this would be better:  print "{x:.2g} +/- {e:.1g}".format(x=1.3453 e=0.321) @merrdiff
1	@KnudJahnke They may not have accretion disks to start with  and be too lightweight to acquire one? Due time question can be asked of sims?
1	@astronomyblog You could play with it on @__brian_c__ 's computer when you get to Chicago! @amitinho
1	@davidwhogg @amitinho @astronomyblog @__brian_c__ That could be nice: click on a data feature in the prediction panel to move the source...
1	LensWrangler: gravitational lens modeling in the browser. http://t.co/7uAL3aVsrs  JS wizards: @amitinho  @astronomyblog and @__brian_c__
1	@astronomyblog I saw! It's cool seeing you with the characters you've met - and the scenery is staggering. And such long roads...
1	@astronomyblog @RTWbike You've been out in the wild west alright! Great stuff  thanks for posting. Oh and #justkeepriding! :-)
1	@merrdiff @mrtommyb @exoplaneteer Postponing most other practical considerations for now  of course.
1	@merrdiff @mrtommyb @exoplaneteer But in weather forecasting it's the other way around. We're helping people choose where to go on vacation!
1	@mrtommyb Great  thanks Tom! @physicsdavid I hope you are following this. Let's estimate some Tsurface values  and see if we want to visit!
1	@exoplaneteer @mrtommyb No acronyms! I'd vote for naming that temperature the "warmth" - because I want comfort  not just habitability
1	@mrtommyb Nice! Teff and R are in Petigura's table  I suppose. What temperature does Earth have with this formula? Thanks! :-)
1	@mrtommyb @exoplaneteer T makes sense because red = hot  blue = cold  as well as temperature being of crucial interest to tourists!
1	@mrtommyb @exoplaneteer This is for an outreach activity BTW: I am trying to map some balls' colors to something interesting about planets
1	@mrtommyb @exoplaneteer Yeah - I guess T doesn't mean much if you don't know the atmosphere. Maybe  "sunniness" will have to do.
1	@ellieinspace What Quimby et al are suggesting is *minilensing*: high magnification at very small image separation @brendonbrewer
1	@EllieInSpace Microlensing magnifications can be just as high as those induced by galaxies  provided the source is small @brendonbrewer
1	@RTWbike Maybe just pick up a giant overcoat (and a revolver) before you set out? :-) @chrisenorth
-1	The cross section for 30x magnification by a low mass galaxy is small - but PS1 sees a lot of galaxies @EllieInSpace @brendonbrewer
-1	Oguri and I were focusing on multiple images you could resolve: Quimby et al consider low mass lenses too @EllieInSpace @brendonbrewer
1	The first strongly lensed supernova? http://t.co/fsR2nMsQHN describes a foreground galaxy in the SN spectrum! @EllieInSpace  @brendonbrewer
1	@megschwamb @briandnord @dotastronomy Ah! Got it. That was not easy to spot at first glance! Got it working in Safari but not Chrome. Thx!
1	.@brianrmcnamara Try following @davidwhogg @dalcantonJD @Awesome_Ph @BadAstronomer @DavidSpergel @briandnord @aagie for astro news and views
1	Scargle asks: could Fraser et al not be seeing something *other* than axions? They say no  in section 4.3   @e_astronomer
1	Fraser et al detect an annual modulation of the high Earth orbit X-ray background  and suggest conversion of solar axions  @e_astronomer
1	Petrosian talked us through the figures from Fraser et al's XMM solar axions paper http://t.co/WEJ6fCmWCa @e_astronomer
1	Let @philipbull talk you through some of the vagaries of the #BICEP2 data: http://t.co/89Om8cfeXH
-1	@brendonbrewer @astrosonnen Is it still a mixture model when one of only two components is highly constrained by physical assumptions?
-1	@brendonbrewer @astrosonnen Suyu and I are in  making 4 willing Hobbits. Hopefully Gandalf will drop in on the fellowship from time to time
-1	We could look at departure rates as a function of early sim/dud balance (which is random)  to see impact of negative feedback @megschwamb
1	Good question from @megschwamb at my Space Warps seminar today: do users leave after their first few images as a result of the feedback?
1	@brendonbrewer You might like Baes and Gentile's approach: just write them all as "Fox H functions" with various parameters :-)
1	.@mdschneider @realscientists So  air travel for science is important  and a good use of energy. I just like  knowing how much it costs!
1	.@mdschneider @realscientists Mitigation is also adaptation: improving our sense of environmental stewardship will make us more resilient.
1	.@mdschneider @realscientists I don't doubt the technology will come - but climate change mitigation is a race against time.
1	.@mdschneider @realscientists The trade is between air travel "for science " and being the change we need. It's hard to advocate w/o action!
1	@PenguinGalaxy @AstroKatie Also please note the revised distance in my previous tweets; Van Cleve was being a bit optimistic yesterday!
1	@PenguinGalaxy @AstroKatie Among other things. The paper I tweeted (from @cloud149) has a table of molecules and their detectability :-)
1	@AstroKatie @RickDNewton @KarenLMasters @jen_gupta @jegpeek @astroduff I agree with Tremaine too  but only up to a point.
1	.@megschwamb I think Twitter is especially important because it forces researchers to *get to the point* - so it's good training.
1	.@megschwamb I think tweeting is an important skill for researchers  whose work is in-depth by definition. Also webinars are so 2010! :-)
1	.@sarahkendrew @KarenLMasters @dalcantonJD @AstroKatie @astropixie @arielwaldman  @ebromleymdphd Thanks!
-1	@brendonbrewer @mdschneider I have! Suyu et al 2010  2012  2013. That was  admittedly  a low-D problem.
1	@ProfMike_M @vrooje @runnerman87 @williamsmj You know I'd never noticed the male origin of "patronizing" before! http://t.co/6VXASCzvSj
-1	Apropos acronyms #37: For the notoriously slow-to-calculate Bayesian Evidence  you can use "FML"  @davidwhogg @brendonbrewer @exoplaneteer
1	@kevinschawinski @astropixie Merger! Roll the dice to see the strength of your new starburst  and take an AGN card
1	@brendonbrewer Did you just summarize your entire and successful research career? :-)
-1	Pulling an all-nighter here at @SLAClab to crunch the VICS82 #StargazingLIVE @SpaceWarps classifications. Code is running: distractions pls!
1	@astronomyblog They put their best machine on it! I guess it as over-powered with astro-love :-)
-1	@davidwhogg @brendonbrewer Yep  that's part of what I meant by "contrived." Also  making simplified mock data for which hyperpriors are easy
1	Good man. Now go and get on that plane! RT @davidwhogg: My @NASAKepler two-wheel white paper is here http://t.co/0l0jWNj9nv
1	Quote is from @brendonbrewer 's new blog! A nice new source of drollery :-) http://t.co/DhnjjLeG7l @davidwhogg @exoplaneteer
1	"I liked that you could take the log of a probability  call it information  and sound like you understood profound truths." - @brendonbrewer
1	@jakevdp @davidwhogg @exoplaneteer @amitinho They face a difficult decision... Like @brendonbrewer  I like GPL's virality. Esp for science!
1	@brendonbrewer I wonder how many citations it will receive?
1	@chgreer @brendonbrewer Also  arxiv is not free: somebody is paying for it!
1	@brendonbrewer Haha! You have adopted my approach to understanding probabilistic graphical models :-) @davidwhogg @chgreer @astrodrian
1	@astronomyblog @GeertMcTwit  Looks like a long and difficult conversation  Stuart. Good thing it happened *yesterday * eh? Keep smiling! :-)
1	@vrooje @jgeach @kevinschawinski @EricRWeinstein Well  it looks like a nice evening for it! :-)
1	@vrooje @jgeach @kevinschawinski Good for him! I like the sound of the cut of his gib.
1	@vrooje @jgeach @kevinschawinski Some elegance to start from  plus lots of opportunities for falsification? Sounds promising! :-)
1	@vrooje @jgeach @kevinschawinski What did the particle theorists make of it? What predictions does the theory make?
1	@astrofairy @anupreeta @a_kapadia @astronomyblog Thanks! Everyone loves gravitational lenses :-)
-1	@dallascampbell Both those tweets might be rubbish. I seem to recall something else about vortices  but I never understood that part
-1	@dallascampbell Bernouilli discovered this pressure difference while in the shower one day. He called it "the stupid curtain" effect
-1	@dallascampbell A wing is shaped so the air rushes over it faster than under it  which lowers the air pressure on top and gives it "lift"
1	@shaka_lulu Cheers! :-)
1	@brendonbrewer @apontzen Aha - so you reserve the word "data" for the output of non-inferential procedures? (Or things assumed to be such)
1	My main point was that "data modeling" reminds me to test my assumptions about the telescope as well as the galaxy @apontzen @brendonbrewer
1	Having said that  we often do receive data in catalog form  ready to be compared with our generative model outputs @apontzen @brendonbrewer
1	There's something unsatisfactory about treating data as sacred constants. A good experimenter will report a PDF! @apontzen @brendonbrewer
1	@apontzen @brendonbrewer It's clearly about time I thought about this again! I learned the phrase from David MacKay: maybe time to move on?
1	@KirkDBorne But this implies twitter shouldn't be used as a filter. If my trusted voices can't be trusted  it's a noisy channel at best...
1	.@KirkDBorne Isn't the "github for science"  um  @Github? I am finding it to be transformative software - what's to add? Sell me banyan! :-)

1	@astronomyblog Nice essay on the naturality of small world networks: http://t.co/Dscmmbvfdd I guess our surprise is just village mindset ;-)
1	@aagie @telescoper @davidwhogg @albertopepe I found 13 papers mentioning "cosmology" in PLoS ONE  0 by cosmologists! http://t.co/rSnimHplOx
1	I support #openscience  and am willing to vote with my feet. Which journal should I publish in today? @aagie @telescoper @davidwhogg
1	@astronomyblog It's a bower bird! Amazing creatures. The male builds a house for his mate  and gets very annoyed if you rearrange his garden
1	@exoplaneteer @brendonbrewer 20 seconds per slide should be plenty! I think there's an "auto play" option  you can just use that
1	Inching closer to online model-based image annotation (a.k.a. online gravitational lens modeling) with @astronomyblog http://t.co/y0o44iOpL4
1	@shaka_lulu It is very important to the University of Oxford that everyone on the videoconference knows I am at the University of Oxford
1	@brendonbrewer @tslumley Great! How does runtime scale with Npar? And do you plan to plug STAN into any nested samplers?
1	Great seminar by Girolami (UCL) on Hamiltonian MCMC: he uses the Riemannian geometry of the target PDF to shape the proposal @brendonbrewer
1	All-video astrostats conference could be a lot of fun! Could be better than mixing in-person with remote... @brendonbrewer @AstroKatie
1	I'm really liking Hangouts for scientific collaboration  but the 10 player limit is a problem. Plans  @aGoogler? @brendonbrewer @AstroKatie
1	@brendonbrewer @AstroKatie Do antipodean researchers get bigger travel grants to help them participate? Is there a strong videoconf culture?
1	#RussianMeteor as seen from Meteorsat 9  and overlaid on Google Earth by @blobrana https://t.co/rpDTLFrq …http://t.co/7MxzAdr5
1	@blobrana I guess we now know something about cratering reports! :-)
1	@blobrana @GeertMcTwit Oh cool! I didn't know we had satellite imaging of the vapour trail. Nice work!
1	@blobrana @GeertMcTwit That's cool! What are we seeing  exactly? (And in 140 characters ;-)
-1	Yep! It's so low-res though that it's better thought of as pixel mapping. We do an approximate PSF blur as well! @kwwillett @astronomyblog
1	Today I inspected and voted on 40 potential observing targets with Verma and More - using Google+! @a_kapadia @astronomyblog @augustmuench

1	@astronomyblog Source it in your .cshrc file; it tells the "complete" command how to complete the command line when you hit "tab"
1	@sarahkendrew @astronomyblog @astrobiased Best to keep those things under wraps  I agree. More here for you:  http://t.co/36Py72TN
1	@sarahkendrew @astronomyblog @astrobiased If you want to make .tar files as well as .tar.gz files  there's a command longer than 140 chars!

1	@philipbull Niiiiice. Lots of talk at #SnowPAC yesterday on GPU clusters - we should think about writing code for them. Aris has one  no?
1	@PeoplesAstro Nice piece on gravitational lenses! Did you know you can simulate one with a wineglass? :-)  http://t.co/DdB5grLU
1	@philipbull Wait what? Wouldn't it have been more logical to write your second python in python instead?
1	That was good: Conroy  Treu  Auger  Leauthaud  Cappellari at dinner  @brendonbrewer and me on skype  coordinating our IMF science. #SnowPAC

1	@REasther @StartsWithABang give them time!
1	@StartsWithABang lambda-CDM - is there nothing it can't do (post facto)?
1	Thanks @brendonbrewer for a great few days in Auckland. Deep thoughts were had (not only on science!)
1	@fossilcrox @riaus Absolutely!! Thanks for pointing out the one-sidedness of the conversation!
1	@mjibrown Aliens?
1	@globalecoguy @btucker22 @sciencealert All science is inference from observation.
1	@btucker22 @sciencealert I know  just trying to pick apart why they manage to fit a different expansion history through the data.

1	@thinking__cat @doctorkarl @lukebarnesastro Would love to. Let me chat with the others &amp; see what we can arrange :)
1	In Auckland for a week with @brendonbrewer and PhD student Mat to get our teeth into some Bayesian science! https://t.co/wkgWP4mSNO
1	@david_hurn @lukebarnesastro @tokteacher That one is definitely a maybe.
1	@david_hurn @lukebarnesastro @tokteacher If by evolving you mean “changing with time”  then yes  it is.
1	@e_astronomer yep  same discussion. Skol!
1	@e_astronomer was this max entropy equals no time? Then I've been there.
-1	@StartsWithABang @elonmusk @lirarandall and I think your wrong to be so sure  and discussed in @AFortunateUni
1	@brendonbrewer @doctorkarl @garethdl83 @cosmicpinot Don’t think so.

1	@mjibrown @btucker22 @nickevershed We really need a club for us receivers of the truth!
1	@startswithabang @r_trotta Yep  the theories are special/general  not the relativity. Can lead to lead to confusion.
1	@startswithabang Thank you!! Thank you!! I’d like to thank my family for all their …
1	@StartsWithABang great stuff  but it's General theory of relativity  not theory of general relativity. The theory is general.

1	@piccolomud @mcnees @astrokatie The rocketeer in this paper was a she. https://t.co/x6LFkSns88
1	@bluebearsoup @fcain no  but the hardware is *not* the simulation. Whatever hardware our simulation is running on  it is not the universe.
1	@fcain ps - this is discussed in our upcoming book "A Fortunate Universe" @AFortunateUni
1	@bluebearsoup @fcain yes  it must. But it is not the universe (in the same way my cosmological simulations are not the computer they are on)
1	@bluebearsoup @fcain a simulation (in software) is not the same as hardware.
1	@bluebearsoup @fcain "is the universe a computer?" Is not the same question as "is the universe a simulation?"

1	@astrotweeps good. Use that to your advantage!
-1	@astrotweeps ignore the brag. It's never mentioned on your cv. Your output  not hours  count.

1	@science_academy And we are not on this list https://t.co/DjiUkONglR
1	@tokteacher @breakfastnews @del_irani Again - I disagree. The actual placing is not a good indicator  but relative to the top is.
1	@tokteacher @breakfastnews @del_irani The point is we are supposed to be becoming an innovation nation. It does not appear to be happening.
-1	@tokteacher @breakfastnews @del_irani I disagree that it is ‘meaningless’. It does reflect the true level of innovation in this country.

1	@startswithabang Your readers might like “On The Relativity of Redshifts: Does Space Really "Expand"?” https://t.co/1NYLIgWPCn
1	@astrotweeps I know that map!
1	@sourcecommsaus @jackie_randles @profbriancox @maasmuseum @sydsciencefest @sydney_science There is no “bottom” or top or sides or centre.
-1	@L0Jim maybe - but are nations obsessing about medal tallies the way to achieve that?
1	@bencubby Right behind verbing the noun!
1	@l0jim Are athlete’s healthier?  https://t.co/TDoVpSiRyF Do we need a multi-million dollar AIS to have athletics in society?
1	@drarnakarick Same issue as always - more money would solve a lot of things. But can’t see it happening.
1	@drarnakarick @astromatto @sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot Have actually had these kind of discussions - always limited funds
1	@drarnakarick @astromatto @sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot That would mean reducing the number of permanent staff.
1	@brendonbrewer and who decides that?
-1	@brendonbrewer That would help solve the problem.
-1	@brendonbrewer The ones who would take it if voluntary would be the ones you would not want to leave (&amp; vice versa)
1	@cosmicpinot @brendonbrewer I didn’t say they had to stop researching  supervision etc. Just support themselves differently. Frees up lines
-1	@brendonbrewer Lack of positions due to doddery old unproductive professors staying rather than going  is an issue.
1	@brendonbrewer You would get 5 years salary severance pay.
1	@brendonbrewer @sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick Why?
1	@sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick https://t.co/c81lQF6uOZ
1	@cosmicpinot @sarahkendrew @drarnakarick I agree! But people must understand this when coming in door  not only while going out.
-1	@sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick Or force retirement from academic positions (at 50?)
1	@sarahkendrew @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick But will there ever be enough permanent positions for postdocs?
1	@drarnakarick @cosmicpinot I don’t think politicians care that much about the scientific funding cycle.
1	@drarnakarick @cosmicpinot Postdocs are effectively set by grant funding - would love to lock in 3+ years  but funding cycle doesn’t work.
1	@popsci Jet glider? Huh?
1	@brendonbrewer Sounds (and looks) wonderful :)
1	@brendonbrewer Progress!! and it’s only taken a decade!! :)
1	@brendonbrewer Excellent! (Does it still load only text files?)
1	@StartsWithABang @bstorax @rmathematicus no  there via not a scientific method other than wish you-washy idealism.
1	@bluebearsoup @tokteacher @brendonbrewer @tegmark Test of mathematics  yes  interpretation  no.
-1	@bluebearsoup @tokteacher @brendonbrewer @tegmark Extravagant or not  nothing makes it more than an interpretation.
1	@bluebearsoup @tokteacher @brendonbrewer @tegmark So?
1	@tokteacher @brendonbrewer @bluebearsoup Yes  I understand you are wedded to the idea  but many are not. It feels right to you.
-1	@bencubby @domaincomau I see we have suburb snobbery going on!
-1	@startswithabang Most straight forward interpretation of a critical universe is infinitely large (although GR is geometric  not topological)
1	@StartsWithABang if the universe is infinitely large today  it was at the Big Bang  so there would be an infinite number of points at birth
1	@spiritualgenome @LIGO @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @RupertSheldrake just different way of looking at the same things.
1	@spiritualgenome @LIGO @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @RupertSheldrake Fourier transforms don't change things from a to b.
1	@spiritualgenome @LIGO @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @RupertSheldrake nope.
1	@spiritualgenome @ligo @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @rupertsheldrake Whatever.
1	@spiritualgenome @ligo @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @rupertsheldrake [Actually following null paths in 4-D means their speed is zero]
1	@spiritualgenome @ligo @anilananth @davyfreeman @neiltyson @rupertsheldrake Not assumption - mathematics.
1	@spiritualgenome @ligo @skyponderer @josh_sokol @nobelprize Not at all. Just simple mathematics.
1	@spiritualgenome @LIGO @skyponderer @josh_sokol @NobelPrize what does convenience have to do with anything?
-1	@startswithabang Sorry  British reserve kicking in!
1	@StartsWithABang we only get predictive science in 3 space &amp; 1 time  &amp; why our universe ended up like this is a bit of a mystery!
-1	@marcuschown @brainpicker More strictly speaking  the discovery of dark matter is a messy topic (from page 113 in https://t.co/0qOjoqEoUu)
1	@broadly @bencubby I believe in aliens (but not that they have visited here). Does that make me a celebrity?

1	@delfindelfinis @merrickphillip @doctorkarl @astropixie @cosmicpinot What does that *mean*?
1	@merrickphillip @doctorkarl @astropixie @cosmicpinot @delfindelfinis But nobody knows how mass from the Higgs field causes gravity. Mystery!
1	@MerrickPhillip @DoctorKarl @astropixie @cosmicpinot @delfindelfinis what does that mean?
1	@L0Jim no  they don't  but some suggest it could be an influence from another universe.
1	@strom_m MMMMMMMMM Bop…
1	@arfisk @doctorkarl You can’t - Heisenberg won’t allow it.
1	@spiritualgenome @LIGO @josh_sokol @NobelPrize @newscientist @neiltyson are they? Can you demonstrate that?
-1	@naturenews Only if you have a desperately narrow definition of what peer review is.
1	@brendonbrewer &amp; I should clarify that economics turned out to be more interesting than I imagined!
-1	@brendonbrewer Ditto - part of the problem was that economics was not what I thought it was!
1	@brendonbrewer I’ve been learning physics for more than 30 years &amp; have only scratched the surface.
1	@adambspencer @Sydney_Uni @Sydney_Science what's a "lunch room"?
-1	@merrickphillip Poor use of if statements (common in astro) conflicting with branch predictors - leads to poor efficiency!
-1	@merrickphillip Alas  given modern hardware  that’s not always the case.
-1	@merrickphillip Problem is that most project don’t think about long term code use - normally quick and dirty coding.
1	@mjibrown … and don’t get me started on the Earth orbiting the Sun…
1	@mjibrown Flat earth  as in entire Earth  is clearly nonsense. But treating my little patch as flat is perfectly acceptable….
1	@mjibrown Yeah  but I get cross with “holier than thou”s laughing at others with regards to their scientific understanding.
1	@MJIBrown and anyone who claims to hold the truth (including scientists) is heading for a fall.
-1	@MJIBrown but extrapolating a model beyond its workable regime is always a problem.
-1	@MJIBrown flat earth is a perfectly acceptable model for most human activities. Don't need to worry about curved Earth to build a house.
1	@astrotweeps I’ll walk with you! Astronomy is my job  not my hobby.
1	@fcain @storybywill that's nothing! I'm going 3% the speed of light relative to something over there (points).
1	@michelle_lmc @AstroKatie you're not the first person I've heard say that!
-1	@StartsWithABang @NASAWatch @AdamFrank4 @nytimes [we're on the same side! Sorry  Twitter not good at catching tone]
1	@StartsWithABang @NASAWatch @AdamFrank4 @nytimes that  sir  is the ENTIRE point. The answer is not a or b  but "between 0 and lots"
-1	@DoctorKarl @Cathy_Crawley @danking0903 @alexwitze @ISS_Research GRRRRR! I hate this kind of comment
-1	@NASAWatch @StartsWithABang @AdamFrank4 @nytimes perhaps we should do probablistic calculations properly &amp; this slap fest can end?
1	@StartsWithABang @AdamFrank4 @nytimes ... The Drake equation is still used in this fashion.
-1	@StartsWithABang @AdamFrank4 @nytimes ... In an outcome  when the answer is plausibly somewhere between zero and a lot. Depressing that ...
-1	@StartsWithABang @AdamFrank4 @nytimes simply a failure of maths  using numbers not distributions for quantities. Results in certainty ...
1	@physorg_com "release a study" means "published a paper"?????

1	@MJIBrown @AstroKatie additionally with funding deadlines.
1	@cloud149 @brendonbrewer @davidwhogg is (are?) statistics science?
1	@michelle_lmc Which really only adds to the mystery!
1	@PopSci yes - next.
1	@mjbiercuk @realscientists And let’s see if it will be..
-1	@mjbiercuk @realscientists Again  I agree - but *everyone* is arguing the same case - critical thinking  problem solving etc.
1	@mjbiercuk @realscientists SKA was then - this is now. Astro does not fit into any ARC strategic directions.
1	@realscientists @mjbiercuk I agree - but saying we simply deserve more than the arts is not going to cut it.
1	@mjbiercuk @realscientists I know!! But  as you know  basic research is left out of strategic alignment of governments etc.
-1	@mjbiercuk @realscientists I think this can be a dangerous and slippery argument. No minister I’ve spoken to likes “basic” science.
1	@mjbiercuk @realscientists I agree  but some people equate useful with applications. Black holes are as useful as poetry.
1	@mjbiercuk @realscientists So - no science for science sake? No work on black holes or searching for dark matter  Higgs etc?
1	@brendonbrewer @fcain @evangough2 Yeah - that’s exactly what sprung into my mind!
1	@cosmos4u @astroduff I didn’t say it wasn’t. I said the explanations are speculative.
-1	@Tim_JR_Hill @marcuschown @MikeTonge that is incorrect. If it was  we would never have measured gravitational waves

1	@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ yeah - academia is rarely the life you dreamt about as a student!
-1	@_sarahmartell_ @bradpholden ditto - but we should not have been so naive to the options.
1	@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ imhe much of the thought of academic careers comes from not considering options.
1	@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ i don't train mine to be academics and encourage constant thinking of career options.
1	@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ here we have to have justified ranked lists for all positions.
1	@drsimmo @bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ i agree - metrics are useful.
1	@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ training grad students is fine unless you think sole purpose is to produce more academics.
1	@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ usually it's a committee discussion so a captain's pick doesn't normally work. Need to produce ranked list.
1	@_sarahmartell_ @bradpholden usual question - how do you judge the "worth" of an academic? How would you rank a pool?
1	@StartsWithABang @Forbes .. whether you out run photons in curved space-time.
1	@StartsWithABang @Forbes in a "propagation of disturbance in space-time" kind of a way. Speed of light is a local thing &amp; doesn't dictate ..
-1	@forbes @startswithabang Similarly  disturbances can travel slower than c.
-1	@forbes @startswithabang … a local quantity and disturbances can outrun photons (i.e. alcubierre metric).
-1	@forbes @startswithabang .. it is the characteristic speed of perturbations of a weak-field metric  but for general metrics  c is just …

1	@peterdedmonds Is there a lot of evidence that people on most influential lists go on to influence things?
-1	@Forbes @StartsWithABang surely 99.8% sure is statistical fallacy 101!
1	@david_hurn @bluebearsoup @tokteacher Actually  tomorrow  is slightly less true.

-1	@michelle_lmc Teaching load - words that strike fear into the heart of an academic.
-1	@piccolomud @brendonbrewer @davidwhogg And when I do my Thunderstruck out the door  I am going to scream abuse at being “professional”.
-1	@piccolomud @brendonbrewer @davidwhogg No - they write like what they read. Referees demand. We are becoming more and more crap at writing.
1	@riaus Guess you’ve never been in a chemistry lab…
1	@brendonbrewer @davidwhogg And when you do you often think “what minimal fluff wrapped up in pomposity”…
1	@brendonbrewer @davidwhogg … decoding what people have done is testament to the fact we are in a hole.
1	@brendonbrewer @davidwhogg I don’t think so - I think that’s what science papers are supposed to be. The fact we spend so much time …
1	@brendonbrewer @davidwhogg @aucklanduni I wish we could wipe the slate clean with academic writing and start again…
1	@weezmgk @michaelapage5 @doctorkarl @astropixie Whatever.
-1	@darrencroton @kevinschawinski it's the message that's important  not the font. I use comic sans to send the font sobs into a frenzy.
1	@MJIBrown IRAF? How quaint!
1	@peterdedmonds @spacedotcom I am definitely not in that boat. “Hawking says…” is an immediate turn off to a story for me.
1	@PeterDEdmonds @SPACEdotcom why does anyone care what Hawking has to say on this or most matters?
1	@strom_m @CBSNews exactly - what would happen to a Russian ship sailing of the coast of US?
1	@brendonbrewer welcome to the wonderful world of knowing what's going on. It's not that difficult
1	@sarahkendrew @KarinaVoggel @michelle_lmc we don't have a university police force  and am happy about that.
1	@michelle_lmc @stellarplanet I know :) &amp; think it’s great! but have had trouble explaining to public what “see” means!
1	@michelle_lmc @stellarplanet see? Hmmm
1	@MJIBrown groan...
1	@_sarahmartell_ tap  tap  tap….
-1	@merrickphillip They are  but it’s a little bit more complicated as the universe is expanding.
1	@merrickphillip Speed of light being the speed of light is a *local* thing (i..e. in your laboratory). Speed “over there” can be different
1	@merrickphillip @doctorkarl @cosmicpinot @astropixie Yep  many who know better use the “inflation was faster than light” line!
1	@merrickphillip @doctorkarl @cosmicpinot @astropixie This is proportional to how far they are apart. Far enough now has separations &gt;c
1	@merrickphillip @doctorkarl @cosmicpinot @astropixie The important thing is the rate at which the distance between two objects is increasing

1	@dudedarkmatter @peterdedmonds [I was too  and remember everyone going - oh OK - a bit like when we knew what Ho was]
1	@science_academy Would you write about a female mathematician like this?
1	@monsoon0 @sydney_uni @science_academy What do late bloomers who took a while to get used to school and are now in general maths do?
-1	@DudeDarkmatter @JossBlandHawtho @PeterDEdmonds i personally hate fake historical textbook science. Should be thrown away.
1	@DudeDarkmatter @JossBlandHawtho @dalcantonJD @PeterDEdmonds further illustrates that real science is not the science of the textbook.
1	@brendonbrewer you're right! It will be all difficult :)

1	@strom_m @smh Also Einstein’s (and my) birthday :)
-1	@quasidog74 @abcnews24 I actually disagree (quite strongly). Scientists are simply normal people who do science for a living.

1	@michelle_lmc @nfmartin1980 @8minutesold thinking about it  could be one of a few things happening !
1	@nfmartin1980 @8minutesold @michelle_lmc hmmm now i am having second thoughts....
1	@nfmartin1980 @8minutesold @michelle_lmc i think it might be!
1	@8minutesold @michelle_lmc @nfmartin1980 is it what I think it is?
1	@brendonbrewer Your definition of belief (based on evidence) and the accepted version (I just feel this way) are somewhat different.
1	@fossilcrox @riaus @scienceau @riaus So many conversations begin with “I don’t know anything about science…”
1	@fossilcrox @riaus @scienceau @riaus What training do the media do before talking to scientists?
1	@rowhoop @doctorkarl @abcnews24 Looks like you are on next week - will send a screenshot then :)
1	@weezmgk @carolprobets @doctorkarl Should point out I live in NW Sydney  lots of miners  cockatoos  kookaburras  but not seen Birds of Prey.
1	@brendonbrewer @alxetz That’s a nicely coloured straw your grasping at!! :)
1	@alxetz @brendonbrewer Where is statistics when I calculate how a photon travels through space?
1	@alxetz @brendonbrewer I agree  but not sure what the correspondence is supposed to mean.
1	@alxetz @brendonbrewer What does that mean?
-1	@mjibrown @ad_mico I did mis-number my pages once. Not allowed to scribble them out.. Reprint incorrect pages and re-scribble…
-1	@mjibrown Did mine today  silently screaming at myself “Of course this is the current proposal  what else is it likely to be..”
1	@brendonbrewer @nzherald Based on some survey with some random criteria…
1	@andrewwetzel @michelle_lmc That’s fine - but let’s see what happens to predictions that are yet to be tested.
1	@michelle_lmc @andrewwetzel Didn’t want to bring that up - people will think it’s all I bang on about :)
1	@michelle_lmc @andrewwetzel .. solved. We need to take the predictions of this and test it further and see if we can rule out alternatives.
1	@michelle_lmc @andrewwetzel I just mean this is a post-diction - so we have an answer we are happy with  but that doesn’t mean problem is ..
1	@michelle_lmc @andrewwetzel But is this a case of finding the answer when you know what the answer actually is?
1	@mjibrown @arc_gov_au If only there was an online depository.. Oh  we’ve had this conversation (every year!)
1	@mjibrown @ad_mico If only there was a possible way to achieve this seemingly unobtainable technological breakthrough!
1	@newusadream @rcoontz More than 1000 authors? Won’t count in research assessment then!
-1	@DrBenjaminHabib @BreakfastNews I'm terrified every single time. I completely understand and wish you the best.
1	@astrokatie @abcnews24 There’s a run of astronomers in the media! Am in @smh  have been on radio in NZ and am on @abc radio in the morning.
1	@mjibrown I can attend without being a member - just need to know about them.
1	@mjibrown Why?
1	@mjibrown Didn’t know that #ANITA2016 was on  as they didn’t let non-ASA members know. Ah well.
1	@brendonbrewer @jossblandhawtho I will!
1	@brendonbrewer So it does depend upon what their opinion is. Hence some may wish to remain masked.
1	@brendonbrewer Irrespective of opinion?
1	@mtmurphy77 @_sarahmartell_ Do you think we could swing business class flights like (male) cricketers and footballers?
1	@mtmurphy77 @_sarahmartell_ But just a month to go before 9 months of waiting  injected by assessors reports &amp; rejoinder.s Living the life!
1	@mtmurphy77 @_sarahmartell_ I’m in the “two slots” club also… #everywakinghour…
1	should be gender equity for all traveling sports people  &amp; should be cattle class like scientists traveling on taxpayer funds @abcnews
1	@brendonbrewer True free trade agreements are generally good (overall)  but bad for some.
1	@stellarplanet @plutokiller @chrislintott Science has little to do with proof and everything to do with evidence.

1	Come on @ABCNews24 - spondulicks is not an Australian word. English and American!
1	@StartsWithABang @Forbes I always just grab @tamarastro conformal view of the universe!
1	@StartsWithABang @Forbes of course  but I love being picky :)
1	@StartsWithABang @Forbes but being picky  the blobs in CMB are stars and galaxies today.
1	@StartsWithABang @Forbes it's only a little closer
1	@forbes @StartsWithABang Ain’t the particle horizon (and essentially the CMB) ~46 billion light years?
1	@astroduff @brendonbrewer @flintoff11 @theprojectv Ah! He’s a Bayesian then. Excellent.
-1	@brendonbrewer @astroduff @flintoff11 @theprojectv What was the basis of his skepticism? In-depth examination of the evidence?
1	@brendonbrewer you learnt well  young padawan
1	@exploreplanets @science_academy Surely it’s observational evidence of a theoretical planet? There is no such thing as theoretical evidence.
-1	@brendonbrewer Correct. The fall doesn’t kill you - the rapid stop at the end does.

1	@mjibrown No - New one on me!

1	@mjibrown What's the point of having an orcid id if I can't simply enter that and it uploads my papers in the correct format.
1	@mjibrown And the bit where I have to format my publication list and star this  and wangle that..
1	@brendonbrewer @JohnDCook absolutely!
1	@ProfBrianCox @jodrellbank @BBCStargazing that is a radio telescope  so clouds don't matter.
1	@marcuschown I think I might know who you are talking about.

1	@mjibrown I got that one too…
1	@darth_ben @nhuntwalker @dudedarkmatter @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport What's old is new again!
1	@dudedarkmatter @darth_ben @nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport I agree  but the tools help  not hinder…
1	@nhuntwalker @dudedarkmatter @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Correct  but then astronomy shuffles forward  reinventing &amp; shuffling
-1	@dudedarkmatter @nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Shameless reposting https://t.co/E2ikRlWVCW
1	@dudedarkmatter @nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Maths  speaking  strategic thinking are all tools. They help.
1	@nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Yep. Programming should be as integral to physics as  well  integrals (&amp; other maths)
1	@nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Correct! and to be convinced it is important (like stats  writing  speaking etc)
1	@nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Yep  like most astronomers. Yet it is key to many astro careers.
-1	@nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport Writing clumsy code leads to inefficiencies &amp; constant reinvention of wheel
-1	@nhuntwalker @dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport And that’s where the problem starts! I advocate proper programming as key astro skill
-1	@dalcantonjd @astronomolly @jradavenport @nhuntwalker Most astronomers actually suck at programming rather than algorithms. Most such bad..
1	@kipstewart @doctorkarl @phoboshighway Proportional to M  and that is larger in a longer cylinder.
1	@MJIBrown funny thing is that Australia is really so homogeneous compared to European counties  or even the US. Everywhere is the same.
1	@brendonbrewer Could mean that it is a bit more “bespoke” than mass produced  off-the-plan kind of places.
1	@brendonbrewer More likely this? https://t.co/hf6q92L0NM
1	@brendonbrewer A fletcher is someone who puts the feathers on arrows  so it should be obvious!
-1	@popsci The answer is yes no matter how much history is to be revised (&amp; the picture is an american launch post war).
1	@mjibrown Fair enough…
1	@mjibrown Hmmm.. Didn't think the comment was that bad.
1	@DRG_physics please feel free to call back when it's online again :)
1	@drg_physics Nope. In physical distance  it asymptotes to a fixed value.
-1	@asrivkin @badphysics @astrokatie Sunday trivia - the surface density of the disk of the MW is about a couple of sheets of paper. That’s all
1	@JossBlandHawtho @StartsWithABang anyone who makes a global proclamation is not doing science.
1	@StartsWithABang accurate theories promoted  less accurate demoted
1	@StartsWithABang yep  and talk of religation rather than falsification
-1	@StartsWithABang I think I disagree with you a little. “Falsification” is an arbitrary standard in science  which leads to trouble.
1	@astrokatie @reasther @startswithabang [Doesn't help that science means different things to different people!]
1	@reasther @startswithabang Interiors of black holes are testable. Find one and jump in.
1	@quasidog74 @DoctorKarl @Edshouston @AtyHans @voiceofapollo in general  yes  but mathematics of cosmology only has space expanding.
1	@Edshouston @AtyHans @DoctorKarl @voiceofapollo for everyone at "rest" wrt to BB  but the same time has passed.
1	@ProfMSmall @Edshouston @AtyHans @DoctorKarl @voiceofapollo no - in the mathematics of cosmology  only space expands ( in FRW metric)
1	@edshouston @atyhans @doctorkarl @voiceofapollo Time does not expand. Only space.
1	@phil_baty @global_bu @michelle_lmc No data for the US  Canada and Australia? Huh?
1	@astroduff @breakfastnews As I was observing for @galahsurvey last night  I was asleep when you were on :)
1	@mjibrown PiP may win! https://t.co/Opii16WXCH
1	@MJIBrown @RetractionWatch not sure - does joc tells us theirs?
1	@MJIBrown @RetractionWatch have u chkd out received and accepted dates in progress in physics?
-1	@rock_muppet @doctorkarl The presence of the moon has stabilised the rotation of the Earth.
1	@rock_muppet @doctorkarl It provides a breaking on the Earth's rotation.  I love non-spherical gravitational pulls.
-1	@galahsurvey @_sarahmartell_ Gremlins chased away! We are collecting photons from stars!
1	@_sarahmartell_  Oh yeah - it's shaping up to be a real "classic" night!!
1	@_sarahmartell_ Red screen  klaxons  and now a bit of spanner wielding!
-1	First night of three observing for @galahsurvey at @AAOastro  - &amp; unfortunately the gremlins are out in abundance!!
1	@fringetracker @brendonbrewer You can't win them all!
1	@mjibrown One person's opinion which continues the downward spiral of scientific writing.
-1	@mjibrown It is precisely this snobbery that has turned scientific writing into the turgid mess it finds itself in. Dull &amp; zombie-like.
-1	@mjibrown Precisely - it's what is said that's important  not how it is said. Font snobs are as useless as music  book  food  wine etc snobs
1	@mjibrown I use comic sans in talks.
1	@brendonbrewer It would benefit from the addition of a Union Jack.

1	@thebrolster @brendonbrewer wait til you've got kids!
-1	@mjibrown @abcnews What really annoys me is that the teacher dreaded teaching science &amp; so "creative"ed it. Didn't understand science!
-1	GRRRR!!! Now @abcnews is equating "Creativity" as "Not Science". For flips sake!
-1	@astrotweeps @DrMaggieHardy @realscientists the opposite of science is not creative- I am tired of explaining this to "creative types"
1	@mjibrown @conversationedu Thx!  I was singing when I wrote it :)
-1	@brendonbrewer I just remember compiler dependent issues on how functions were referred. It was painful  but fun to do. Maybe it is easier
1	@brendonbrewer I used to do that - I had to write a c interface between the two. Those were the days!
-1	@mjibrown @conversationedu Wouldn't be the tired old stereotypical view of a scientists now  would it?
1	@mjibrown @conversationedu @rawstory Why is the Einstein character at the top of the article wearing a lab coat and holding a test tube?
1	@pythonomer @timesofindia there were a lot of people "on the street" of NY on 9/11
1	@brendonbrewer @DataSciFact stats  maybe  but grammar!!!!
-1	@brendonbrewer @BridieSmith this is about block funding  not grant funding.
1	@pythonomer @brendonbrewer We should stop teaching classical statistical tests first -as it gets ingrained as "correct" and is hard to shift
1	@brendonbrewer I dream about them. And when I say dream  I don't mean in a good way!
1	@astroduff @breakfastnews I think it is going to be fun! Some decent auroras over Sydney would be nice!
1	@astroduff @breakfastnews Did you know that the Earth's magnetic north pole is not on the opposite side of the planet to its south pole?
1	@astroduff @AusAndgie7 @AstroKatie @ABCNews24 you do realize it cost more than 150 billion - that's more than Apollo.
1	@astroduff @AusAndgie7 @AstroKatie @ABCNews24 nope. It was a diversion of funding from other (imho) more important space exploration.
1	@ausandgie7 @astrokatie @abcnews24 https://t.co/QgIAZ4RmBC
1	@ausandgie7 @astrokatie @abcnews24 Not just me it seems https://t.co/MemUKi00ZK https://t.co/d21mJQcBMq https://t.co/MmTi6Qhl5u
1	@ausandgie7 @astrokatie @abcnews24 *Shrug* never said there were no outcomes  just that ISS has been a diversion from other activities.
-1	@AstroKatie @AusAndgie7 @ABCNews24 Alas  I see ISS as little more than a white elephant that has diverted funding from other areas.
1	@brendonbrewer yep - like those too!
1	@brendonbrewer Which ever you like  and ignore the colormap zealots…
1	@katieoh9 @astrotweeps down

1	@michelle_lmc Embrace those youthful looks. No one ever asks me if I am a new student  no matter how hard I try!
-1	@mjibrown @arc_gov_au I do! As you know  I think all academics should be made redundant at 50!
1	@mjibrown @arc_gov_au That was noted by several I chatted with.
-1	@mjibrown @arc_gov_au As were several unsuccessful ones!
1	@brendonbrewer @ad_mico [? haz?]
1	@jegpeek @astroduff @arc_gov_au good luck everyone!
1	@brendonbrewer @LianneZimm buy in somewhere and use CG to upgrade in a few years.
1	@brendonbrewer @LianneZimm are you looking to buy for life? Clearly capital gain is your friend in Auckland.
1	@_sarahmartell_ There is no practical limit to rsync  only impractical!
1	@hcaflinders @drspacejunk I think we'll be at the same event this evening!!
-1	@ad_mico @SmithsonianMag not bored  but continually dismayed at the lone genius myth
1	@strom_m https://t.co/TiLFfrpgdT  https://t.co/nuGva0ObuT https://t.co/NE3ho6Ku0r  etc
-1	@strom_m That's precisely what "risk" means. And it is relative risk that should be reported  not hysterical "IT WILL KILL YOU"
-1	@strom_m GRRR!! I didn't say it didn't! I said the important issue is "risk"  not is it a carcinogen!
1	@strom_m @theatlantic That's what I said :)
-1	@strom_m And frightening the bejesus out of people without explaining this is a terrible approach.
-1	@strom_m carcinogenic does not mean "guaranteed to give you cancer".
-1	@strom_m I never said it wasn't. What I said was that everything comes with a relative risk. This is the important thing to understand.
-1	@strom_m And less than the estimated rate from air pollution - 1483 (https://t.co/GGmciZCrlH)
-1	@strom_m Significantly less than the suicide rate 2461 https://t.co/tzIIsVWDXP
-1	@strom_m Less than number of deaths on the road - 1200 (https://t.co/7zInf4FQSs)
-1	@strom_m Number of bowel cancer in Australia = 17070 (https://t.co/BPa3Ci2fFa) 18% increase is 3072. Survival 67%  so 1024 deaths per yr.
-1	@strom_m I haven't! What is important is what is the actual relative risk. People are hopeless at assessing this.
1	@strom_m And you come to that conclusion based on ?
-1	@strom_m Of course. Smoking comes with risks. You are not guaranteed to get cancer if you smoke but the chances are higher than if you don't
-1	@strom_m Is eating bacon more dangerous than breathing in the pollution in Sydney?
-1	@strom_m I meant the world is not full of "good things" that don't cause cancer  and "bad things" that do.
-1	@strom_m Is eating bacon everyday more or less risky than running across the M5? What about compared to rock fishing? Everything has risks.
-1	@strom_m But cancer is not binary. There are  relative risks associated with everything  and we are poor at understanding these.
-1	@stargazerfred @abcnews I weep gently to myself when I see a story about quantum mechanics claim it is "spooky".
1	@mjibrown @cosmicpinot @scibry I still stand my http://t.co/c81lQF6uOZ - happy to move the kick out age to 50.
1	@MJIBrown @sortius not that those papers are remotely original.
1	@markapple @aaoastro I believe it will be recorded - will publish details when I have them.
1	@dudedarkmatter @grumpykelson @jbprime Even that is uncertain  especially if you're just a brain in a jar (of beer?)
1	@GrumpyKelson @jbprime @DudeDarkmatter time is what clocks measure (with an uncertainty)
1	@GrumpyKelson @jbprime @DudeDarkmatter all information arriving in your mind comes with an uncertainty.  Some uncertainties are very small
1	@jbprime @grumpykelson @dudedarkmatter Loads of people use the geocentric model everyday when working out what time it is. Still useful
-1	@grumpykelson @jbprime @dudedarkmatter A level of subjectivity comes in to it - what is "reasonable doubt" for evidence. This is subjective.
1	@grumpykelson @jbprime @dudedarkmatter "Fact" are not absolute  but come with uncertainties  and so nothing can be absolutely ruled out.
1	@RiAus not leap into the air when instructed?

1	Looks like Pluto from New Horizons  but alas it's just the sky above the AAT @AAOastro http://t.co/gX64CEFaJi
1	@brendonbrewer @stuartjritchie Thanks - also found this http://t.co/YInh9goZZb
-1	@brendonbrewer @earl_leonard Plausible  yes  but does it happen. My gut feeling (from whom I meet) that the correlation is weak.
1	@brendonbrewer @nzstuff SNAP!!
1	@alex_parker @mjibrown I too was sitting there wondering if he would make it to the end! (although he didn't die in Ronin IIRC)
1	@skdh @physorg_com I just try to balance my portfolio  with some more left-field coupled with more mainstream. #strategyisnotadirtyword
-1	@brendonbrewer I have a fear of them breaking in and taking my house apart!
1	@mjibrown @briscoejames I agree! But I have an idea for the perfect physics textbook!
1	@sydney_science One of the brightest quasars in the Universe and a strange plane of dwarf galaxies in Andromeda.
1	@mjibrown @briscoejames Absolutely!!! I very much agree. Perhaps you and I should go into the textbook industry?
-1	@vacant3rdman @jossblandhawtho FFS! Another one!! http://t.co/BQkXHyBxo7
1	@vacant3rdman @jossblandhawtho Yes  I must have received 7 or 8 of them by now.
1	@nfmartin1980 @michelle_lmc wonderful! I will soon become a Ph.D. grandfather - and it has been the best part of being an academic :)
-1	@michelle_lmc Backed the wrong horse there! :)
1	@astrokatie @mjibrown Posted mine to twitter this morning.
1	@spacecom @badastronomer Have you not been reading the newspapers? http://t.co/8k72wMukIj
1	@bencubby @MJIBrown more moist than wet!
-1	@jayalver @trampolinrocket Yes  but I have already heard comparisons to rivers etc  which are incorrect.
-1	@polyman71 @trampolinrocket Listed as a possible but followed by "it is unclear whether Martian atmosphere can supply sufficient water.."
1	@polyman71 @trampolinrocket It's a possible but direct from paper "The origin of water forming the RSL is not understood" followed by maybes
-1	@polyman71 @trampolinrocket Actually  it doesn't (having read the paper) - ambivalent on source of water.
1	@jayalver @trampolinrocket Flow gives the image of the Amazon. Dribble is damp dirt on a slope  which is closer to the truth.
1	@brendonbrewer it is such a mismatch to the ideal of science sold publicly.
1	@brendonbrewer how can this be? Science is nothing but data &amp; statistics! Or are you suggesting that people  &amp; their priors  are involved?
1	@astroduff @breakfastnews If the LIGO rumours are remotely true  we are going to find ourselves in an interesting situation.
1	@brendonbrewer Correct. Need to get on the short-list &amp; should make the readers job easy to make this judgement.
-1	@REasther @brendonbrewer and people who make it difficult to assess if they are top performers are dooming themselves. Make it simple.
1	@REasther @brendonbrewer yes  and things like h-index  total cites etc are a starting point. Need to get on short list of top performers.
1	@REasther @brendonbrewer how do you rank n people for such an appointment?
1	@REasther @brendonbrewer yes  but h-index is a starting point  not answer.
-1	@REasther @brendonbrewer my worry is academics would prefer to be assessed through magic and feelings rather than anything tangible.
-1	@REasther @brendonbrewer overdo is bad  but pretending it's not there is madness.
1	@REasther @brendonbrewer again  meaning less to you  but those who look good like them. As you like total cites.
-1	@REasther @brendonbrewer agreed  overboard is bad  but using to your advantage is not.
1	@REasther @brendonbrewer my advise is to get advise on how best to present themselves
1	@REasther @brendonbrewer seeing a lack of discussion of publication stats  relative to others etc up front looks like hiding something
1	@REasther @brendonbrewer Grrr the point is not the merits of the h-index  but how you sell yourself. Pretending they don't exist is stupid.
-1	@REasther @brendonbrewer it does contain information  and up to you to sell your publication stats. Ignoring this is ignorance.
1	@REasther @brendonbrewer yes  they will  &amp; total cites etc. but why make them work?
1	@REasther @brendonbrewer those that look good in total citations will support you.
1	@REasther @brendonbrewer h-index is not the problem. Academics refusing to be compared in a statistic that does not make them look good is.
1	@brendonbrewer you should put it at the start.
1	@brendonbrewer @ickbat You sir  do not have fine taste :)
1	@macastrosoc @sydney_uni As ever  it was great fun! Thanks for the invite and I look forward to your birthday party :)
1	@brendonbrewer or you could just get on and do something useful :)
1	@brendonbrewer once you've closed them  how do you read the rest of the instructions?
1	@sctrager @jegpeek Currently editing a 430 page book in word… So glad it was not in latex….
-1	@peterdedmonds I made the mistake of reading the comments to the article. I love being called ignorant and stupid!
1	@brendonbrewer @michelle_lmc Spendvision!! Process for clearing work credit card (involving scanning in a pile of receipts).
1	@cathomas09 Well done!

1	@sondy [ reviews invective vocabulary ]  His conscience has been eaten by a dog.
-1	@PlanetDr @elakdawalla @Alex_Parker It would be a very bad idea for me to drink  for many reasons.  Hence baking.
1	@elakdawalla @PlanetDr @Alex_Parker I wrote a large portion of a proposal today.  I will now resort to baking cranberry bars.
1	@erinleeryan If that's what is meant  then that's what should have been written (then it would have been right). @annevirkki @PlanetTreky
1	Suddenly  @PlanetTreky appears. https://t.co/81s6p7B3zW
1	@PlanetTreky Would be good to know who some of those are  and what exactly they're proposing.
1	@PlanetTreky One thing that still isn't clear to me: Who is submitting the proposals for continued operations to the NSF?
1	@PlanetTreky I am confused.  Where would all of the staff work?
1	.@MarsMaven and the other members of the @HiRISE team do good work.
1	@PlanetTreky NASA is right.
1	@PlanetTreky Congratulations!
1	@sondy I think most DPS+EPSC tweeps were at the Women In Planetary Science lunch when the TMT session was scheduled to happen.
1	@sondy I have no information about it.
-1	@sondy [ glares through crust and mantle at offending professors ]
-1	@PlanetTreky @lynn_carter8 There have been other SNR-estimation scripts.  They tended to give wrong answers for some objects...
1	@lynn_carter8 Behold one of my most-frequently-accessed webpages: https://t.co/oMAdaDcOoD @PlanetTreky
1	@starstryder [ checks ]  Apparently  @MerriamWebster hasn't added it yet.  They should.
1	@SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla @sondy Developing the first version of what became the SHAPE software took Scott Hudson a while.
1	@SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla @sondy Steve Ostro got radar images of Castalia in 1989.  Took until 1993/1994 to extract 3D shape.
1	@sondy @SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla Radar images of Castalia 1989; Gaspra imaged by Galileo in 1991; Castalia shape model 1994.
1	@SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla @sondy [3/2] First 3D shape information for asteroids became available in 1991-93 (radar &amp; spacecraft).
1	@SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla @sondy [2/2] Radar silhouettes were available by 1990.  See e.g. Ostro 1993: https://t.co/6hiWXjgqMQ .
1	@SpaceJosh @NovaSilisko @elakdawalla @sondy [1/2] The first radar detection of an asteroid was Icarus in 1968.  Shape modeling was later.
1	@kennicosmith Good luck with the move!
1	@cathomas09 Have a good trip back!
-1	@erinleeryan @lukedones @moonyguy Although I think I understated the size of the problem.
1	@PlanetTreky Enjoy the Huntington!  Their Chinese garden is particularly well done.  And have a good trip back to PR!
1	@sondy @_hroe I am now tempted to ask G&amp;S fans I know if they could do an asteroid-themed spoof song.
1	@PlanetTreky ACM 2017?
1	@PlanetTreky Have it in Ballroom H too.
1	.@sondy and @asrivkin suggest thermal history test for other asteroids  such as Ryugu.  Probably not enough of Itokawa available...#DPSEPSC
1	.@sondy  tangentially: Those considering mining asteroids for water by baking them will want to consider Hg  As  S  Cd  etc. #DPSEPSC
-1	.@sondy at #DPSEPSC: Laboratory work constraining the thermal history of @OSIRISREx's target Bennu.
1	@PlanetDr Enjoy Arizona  then.
1	@PlanetDr Have a good trip back across the continent!

1	@sondy @erinleeryan @astrocfi And  of course  I blinked.
1	.@PlanetTreky Lots of ends of @NASA missions next year.  But ideally also some beginnings.
1	@ProfAbelMendez @PlanetTreky Thanks for posting the link to this piece! @SETIInstitute
-1	@PlanetTreky [ glares at offending NASA mission teams ]
-1	@plutoprincessz That argument seems misplaced when it results in losing current capabilities.  But perhaps I am biased on this one.
1	@sondy Also  welcome to Pasadena!
1	@PlanetTreky @NAICobservatory Would be nice if NASA would pick up the bill...
1	@AscendingNode @sondy For planetary science  that is far too often true.
1	@starstryder Thanks for visiting #DPSEPSC yesterday!
-1	@PlanetDr [ looks at offender's account ]  [ reports and blocks ]
1	Public outreach workshop at #DPSEPSC .  @starstryder et al. do good work.
1	@PlanetTreky @benjaminsharkey It also has a very extensive tea menu - https://t.co/1MgPFA7IiA .
1	@benjaminsharkey I'll be placing a reservation for a table at the tea house for 11:30 on the 16th: https://t.co/CWY4ogbGKJ . @PlanetTreky
1	@benjaminsharkey @PlanetTreky I cannot offer either mozzarella or rum.  I can offer tea at Chado.
1	@TheEarthStory Let me know if you figure a way to do that.
1	@erinleeryan @sondy @PlanetDr I took the Physics GRE twice; in April &amp; Oct. 2004. 2nd score was much higher - due only to test-specific prep
1	@PlanetDr @shaka_lulu Isn't "potus" Latin for "drink" ?
1	.@AmyMainzer does good work. https://t.co/MjW4UF8nS3
1	@erinleeryan @sondy Thank you both!
-1	@brianwolven @Alex_Parker Maybe not make puns when I am considering things that are literally matters of life and death?
1	@StarzanPlanets @fossilfriendly @sondy US wide  disenfranchisement affects ~3% of voters.  And  as you wrote  concentrated in some states.
-1	@PlanetDr I'm going to avoid the internet all evening.
1	@fossilfriendly @sondy And  least anyone forget: Former felons not being disenfranchised by itself would have resulted in Gore being elected
1	@sondy @karinsandstrom May the odds be ever in your favor.
-1	@sondy I plan to avoid the internet for the whole of Sunday evening.
1	@NolaTRedd "What made all these different types of meteorites?" was a pretty complicated one to answer.
1	@ltelkins @sslmda [ salutes from Mountain View ]
1	@sondy Even for those propositions that would be good ideas; it's grossly inefficient to handle by referendum rather than the legislature.
1	@sondy @barbylon One of the propositions this time would mandate there being more propositions.  I think I will vote "no" for that.
1	@ltelkins Good luck!
1	@asrivkin @PlanetDr Apparently  this has existed: https://t.co/Am5dAdA2jW .
1	@PlanetDr Thanks for continuing to run the workshop!
-1	@sondy [ glares through planet at offending HR person / ombuds / etc. ]
1	@astrokiwi @asrivkin @david_kipping @shaka_lulu It seems hard enough to look for biosignatures on Europa  Enceladus  etc in our solar system

1	@WeatherOnMars @PlanetaryKeri @elakdawalla @OldCrank Thanks for checking this!
1	@PlanetaryKeri @elakdawalla @OldCrank I suggest checking with @WeatherOnMars.
1	@bengreenman @sondy I'm curious if this poll will end up near 50:50 split or not.

1	.@elakdawalla Good to see @OSIRISREx on the plot.
1	@sondy Not sure if congratulations or disappointment at lead author is indicated here.
1	@sondy @PlanetDr @SETIInstitute Observe: https://t.co/DsKNgtcYTt .
1	@sondy @PlanetDr There was once a dynamics seminar at @SETIInstitute on the dynamics of a falling cat. No cats were harmed in this research.
-1	@shaka_lulu Who also approved sending Purvi Patel to jail for 20 years for having a miscarriage.
1	@cathomas09 Proposal will expand to fill the time available?
1	@sondy @PlanetDr Good idea.
1	@OtherOrbScience But there are better ways to deal with that.
1	@OtherOrbScience Filter to minimize the number of UFO enthusiasts?
1	@erinleeryan @sondy @OtherOrbScience There is now an option to get DPS membership by having sponsors submit endorsement via email.
1	@OtherOrbScience @erinleeryan It would be good to have a secure online payment method.  Which isn't hard to set up.
1	@erinleeryan @OtherOrbScience @sondy I keep my membership to be able to present at the annual meeting.
-1	@sondy If I count correctly  over the entire lifetime of DPS  all but 4 of the people ever on the committee have been white.  Not cool.
1	@sondy Interested parties may want to talk to @gummyshark  as a member of the nominating subcommittee.
1	@erinleeryan @sondy @OtherOrbScience I think I count as an AAS full member now.  Can sign for people.
1	@sondy @erinleeryan I haven't checked the supply chains there.
1	@sondy @erinleeryan Brushed metal  maybe?
-1	@erinleeryan @sondy I was going more for tile being less expensive and not often produced by slave labor.
1	@erinleeryan @sondy Perhaps they simply want a heatproof counter after melting something.  I suggest tile.
1	@JLGalache That one is also good for showing that most of the surveys are in the northern hemisphere.
1	@starstryder And that fraction is quite a bit higher for black men.
1	@sondy I find conflicting reports about the extent of that.  But shipping it a quarter of the way around the world isn't cheap in any case.
1	@sondy Perhaps @ObservatoryCats explaining the importance of intersectional social justice to confused cats? https://t.co/xsTrEneiCD .
1	@sondy From a cursory survey  classism as well as ableism is pretty pervasive among vegans in the US (e.g. not everyone can afford quinoa).
-1	@sondy I once tried to explain to such a person that I could do a vegan diet  but I'd be in pain most of the time.  They told me to suffer.
-1	@caseycourval @sondy I could do without encountering quacks who promote ableist &amp; classist diet nonsense.
1	@xkcdComic @hubbahubble Clearly  he'll be very excited about @OSIRISREx  ARRM  and AIDA.
1	@PlanetDr @AstroKatie Or until a jet blows one spacecraft or the other (or both) out into space.
1	@sondy @DrMRFrancis I suggest we rename JWST after Annie Jump Cannon or Henrietta Swan Leavitt.
1	@elakdawalla @AstroKatie @cirquelar @astroengine Styrobraking ?
1	.@PlanetDr @ESA_Rosetta Now I'm not sure this is accurate.  What's the gravity on 67P versus that on Itokawa?
1	@PlanetDr For additional comparison: @SpaceX Falcon XX is very similar in launch mass capability to SLS Block 2.
1	@PlanetDr @AllPlanets And @SpaceX's single largest _customer_ is NASA.
1	@AllPlanets I submit that @SpaceX has not done that yet.  Let the large launch vehicle be built and flown first.
1	@EricDahlstrom1 They manage it most years.
1	@niais @upulie There's a lot of interest right now in small-scale solar electric propulsion.  e.g. send minisats to _all_ the asteroids...
1	@adamjohnsonNYC @starstryder That's a _very_ dark timeline.
1	@sondy As one does?
-1	@tarahaelle @NolaTRedd [2/2] Actual number of young black men killed by police in 2015 was ~300 =&gt; one in 7.5 of young black men killed.
-1	@tarahaelle @NolaTRedd [1/2] I apologize. I confused the number of young black men killed with the total number of people killed by police.
1	@JayAlver Your posts were _mansplaining_: https://t.co/RYQLOQFU8V .  Don't do that.   I am done.
1	@JayAlver @NovaSilisko Maybe not try to 'splain planetary exploration to @PlanetDr .
-1	@verge @NellyBenHayoun Note: humans can't use that vehicle to go Europa or anywhere near Jupiter. They'd get fatal radiation poison in a day
1	@IBJIYONGI @sondy Good luck.

1	@Alex_Parker @PlanetDr https://t.co/LLtJrTokRY .
-1	@tarahaelle @NolaTRedd ~2250 young black men killed by guns in US / year. Police killed 1134 young black men in 2015 https://t.co/75LrZWh8wq

1	@sondy I'd attempt to send you some inoffensive Bay Area atmosphere  but we have a forest fire in the Santa Cruz mountains just now.
1	@NolaTRedd @tarahaelle @Forbes @SciShortform And for young black men  it's just about 1 in 2.
-1	@PBS @NewsHour You should accompany this with a statement that Trump is blatantly lying  since Trump promotes killing 55 000 women.

1	@niais @PlanetDr @Summer_Ash Good choice.
1	@megschwamb @astrotweeps Done.
1	@megschwamb @astrotweeps I'd be interested in taking the week of 2017 April 10  if you're scheduling that far out.  ACM 2017 happens then.
-1	@sondy @vk2tfg And for a phased array to combine multiple low-power transmitters efficiency  it needs to fill most of the aperture.
1	@vk2tfg @sondy We already do that  transmitting continuously using either binary phase coding or a linear frequency chirp.
1	@vk2tfg @sondy FAST is also not designed to operate at shorter wavelengths than Arecibo is.
1	@vk2tfg @sondy [3/3] Lower wavelength means a smaller microwave resonant cavity; heat-sinking required per unit surface area doesn't change.
-1	@vk2tfg @sondy [2/3] Lower power and equivalent sensitivity are possible only with a much larger antenna (expensive) or lower wavelength.
1	@vk2tfg @sondy [1/3] Astronomical radars are generally power-limited.  e.g. Arecibo has detected radar echoes that were tens of photons.
1	@BlaiseFEgan @sondy @moylecroft As Sondy wrote  there is a power-per-mass limit for normal electronics.  Exceed that  and things melt.
1	@sondy So many brogrammers...
-1	@sondy Candida albicans shows up in about 90% of the population; and this report is based on small number statistics.  I suggest skepticism.
1	@RicardoHarvin That is true.    It's also unacceptable to say "people say Trump is truthful" without making it clear that Trump is a liar.
1	Yes.  And this _should not be a question_.  Do better  @CNN https://t.co/BnhtVPPvOy

1	@benjaminsharkey And good luck!
-1	@benjaminsharkey Outrageous that there isn't still a test location in the Twin Cities.
1	@ObiVonnKenobi Different asteroid missions (@OSIRISREx   @haya2e_jaxa) sample different reservoirs of material from the early solar system.

1	@starstryder @DrMRFrancis As long as I don't get any of the mail intended for my cousin Michael P. Busch's hematology lab  I figure I'm okay
1	@astrotweeps Limited.  I've mostly used it to write out files to be analyzed with other programs.
-1	@astrotweeps The deficiency in my case was that I learned C and Matlab  but not Python - which was not as big in astronomy as it is now.
1	@sondy Paging @WeatherOnMars ?
1	@sondy Lately  I've been evaluating political candidates largely by the expected body-count of the politics they promote.
-1	@amytoast What @sondy wrote.  Especially given McCain's recent nonsense re. Zika virus.
1	@PlanetTreky $5 in royalties means that about 5 copies were sold.
1	@PlanetTreky I had ~30 copies printed through https://t.co/QCt6CyCk03.  In exchange for reduced printing cost  they put it for sale.
1	@PlanetTreky I received a royalty check for people buying my thesis.  It was about $5.
1	@OSIRISREx Note: Normally  KSC -&gt; BNU would be  Košice  Slovakia -&gt; Blumenau  Brazil.
1	@PlanetTreky ... That should have been "residents".  @VisitPocahontas isn't as empty as Boolardy Station.
1	@PlanetTreky And GBT maintains a radio-quiet zone without displacing the resident of Pocahontas County.
1	@sondy @erinleeryan I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a positive or a negative.
1	@starstryder Well played  @scicurious.
1	.@elsisrad is cool. https://t.co/FfITjbL4Qd
1	@Alex_Parker @RachelFeltman https://t.co/ktvdZiM24h .
1	@Alex_Parker @RachelFeltman Let all know the wisdom of Ignacio Anaya.
1	@erinleeryan @PlanetDr @asrivkin I would usually go for the mole negro con pollo: https://t.co/qFQPDWBf3l .
1	@PlanetDr @asrivkin @erinleeryan ... ... Okay.  More for me.
1	@elsisrad @johannateske I suggest a confectionary-themed naming scheme.
1	@astrotweeps I once did a poster proposing a project that turned out to be impossible. Fortunately  I was the one who found the error first.

-1	@marstimrdad @ltelkins Alas.
1	@marstimrdad @ltelkins Is there an open-access version available?
1	@niais @PlanetDr An alert bracelet / other identifier seems a very good idea.
1	@AstroKatie @AllPlanets @exploreplanets Paper says no transit signal with depth &gt;0.05.  But expected transit depth would be less than that.
-1	@astrotweeps @AstroKatie There are limitations of ground-based radio observations here.  Very difficult to go &lt; 10 MHz and see anything.
1	@astrotweeps @AstroKatie At &gt;10 MHz  Jupiter flux &gt;10^4 x Earth flux.  Expected flux for Proxima b greater than Earth  but not by that much.
1	@astrotweeps @AstroKatie Exception is a range around ~300 kHz where auroral bursts on Earth are brighter: https://t.co/buiXaYhYKa .
1	@astrotweeps @AstroKatie Projects for radio detections of exoplanets have focused on Jupiter-mass planets.  Orders of magnitude brighter.
1	.@AstroKatie @AllPlanets @exploreplanets My understanding was that transits by Proxima b haven't been ruled out  but are unlikely (~1.5%) ?
1	@astrotweeps Gas giant mining probably not necessary. Asteroid/lunar mining would be  unless you wanted to irradiate launch zone on Earth.
1	@elsisrad May the new radial velocity values help figure out what's going on.

1	@hubbahubble [2/2] Someone who will already have a highly-relevant masters' degree has demonstrated they have the skills.
1	@hubbahubble [1/2] If there's a particular program she's interested in  it might be worth her checking if they would waive PGRE requirement.
-1	@sondy @hubbahubble Second the @astrobetter list.  Unfortunately  their site is down for maintenance just now so I can't grab the link.
1	Thanks to @elsisrad  @MarsMaven  @AllPlanets  @sangha_deb  &amp; Monika Kress for doing a career panel for @SETIInstitute REU students today!
1	@PlanetDr @hubbahubble Cosign.
1	@robminchin @aliothsan @sondy ... Good thing I used topical picaridin as well as permethrin-treating my clothes when I visited in May.
-1	@OSIRISREx I note sample returns by Genesis  Stardust  and Hayabusa 1; unless  @NASAhistory was restricting things only to the Moon.
1	@sondy @seborn900 Seriously: Citronella isn't recommended for Zika vector control  due to short protection time: &lt; 2 h  v. 8 h for picaridin
1	Thanks also to @ltelkins &amp; @EllenStofan! #NMSS16

1	@TheEarthStory @PlanetDr [ prepares mincemeat cookies ] [ provides extras for @booplefloof ]
1	@TheEarthStory @PlanetDr I learned how to cook a surprising variety of things on a butane-canister camp stove.  That's been useful.
1	@PlanetDr Also  avocados grand marnier wasn't something that should have existed.  But the pulled pork was excellent.
-1	@PlanetDr I also once got to judge the final exam.  That was how I learned that I really do not like pig's ear soup.
1	@PlanetDr That's some impressive energy efficiency for supersonic travel.
-1	@curatedcosmos @astrotweeps The headline is accurate. It is also misleading. It perpetuates colonialist attitudes regarding the mountain.
1	@astrotweeps @curatedcosmos  That quote is misleading without also stating that support is less than 50% among native Hawaiians.
1	@Alex_Parker @PlanetDr I once heard an astronomer describe Jupiter as "a very large dust grain".
-1	@Alex_Parker @PlanetDr The Galileo drop probe had a shield made of carbon phenolic.  Does that burn to graphite in a hydrogen atmosphere?
-1	@asrivkin @PlanetDr Everything is weird.
1	@starstryder Trump: July 27: "America has always led the world in space exploration" Aug 3: "[ space program is ] like a third world nation"
-1	@starstryder Trump lies.  A lot.
1	@sondy It has not yet been tested on non-principal-axis rotators  though. I'm not sure how it would handle 8-dimensional parameter space.

1	@sondy Thanks for doing that. @IBJIYONGI
1	@Fanny57 [2/2] I gave the improvements to weather forecasting as a first example because they far too often go unacknowledged.
1	@Fanny57 [1/2] There are many examples of how space exploration has large returns on investment: GPS  IR cameras  various telecom equipment.
1	@Fanny57 Again  knowledge gained from studying other planets gives better understanding of weather &amp; climate on Earth.
1	@Fanny57 @OmanReagan[2/2]If you would like details of the history of planetary meteorology  you might review past tweets by @WeatherOnMars .
1	@Fanny57 @OmanReagan [1/2]Techniques developed to study Mars' atmosphere  &amp; those of other planets  now are used to study Earth's atmosphere
1	@Roy_Astro Stop demanding that people spend their time telling you things you could Google. And  again: Cut out the whitesplaining. @DNLee5
-1	@Roy_Astro Do not attempt to defend police victimizing people on the basis of race &amp; gender. And do not engage in whitesplaining.@IBJIYONGI
1	@Fanny57 @OmanReagan It happens that space exploration has returned 10:1 on the investment.  For example: better weather forecasting.
1	@astronomolly @astrotweeps Tangent: Ken Liu  translator for Three Body &amp; Death's End  has his own fantasy series: https://t.co/SV02bir1yi
1	@astrotweeps The plot didn't make sense because I knew out what the final resolution was in 5 minutes  while the characters took 100 years.
-1	@astrotweeps "creepy" as in "is a sexual predator"  and the narrative doesn't seem to realize why what he is doing is evil.
1	@astronomolly @astrotweeps And the plot of Dark Forest didn't make any sense.
1	@astronomolly @astrotweeps I haven't read "Death's End".  But the protagonist of "The Dark Forest" was extremely creepy.
1	@astronomolly @astrotweeps Three-Body is good.  But I don't recommend the sequels.
1	@AscendingNode @astrotweeps Unless Eros is to have been moved  that orbit diagram was approximately right for March 2222 and February 2282.
1	@astrotweeps They used the Bennu model for an unnamed rock pile in the main belt; and what appeared to be 67P for another.
1	@astrotweeps @deronaucoin I hope The Expanse updates the Ceres texture maps for the second season with @NASA_Dawn imagery.
1	@astrotweeps @deronaucoin I amused myself by identifying which shape model files they had used for different asteroids.
1	@astrotweeps Netflix  Amazon  iTunes  Hulu ...
1	@astrotweeps "The Expanse" was pretty good.
-1	@sondy @PlanetDr @DrMRFrancis @DrFunkySpoon [ looks up offender ] The shared blocklist has already blocked him.  Well done  blocklist.
1	@cathomas09 Congratulations! @sondy @asrivkin
1	@MarsRoverUH Okay  maybe you win.  @sondy
1	@sondy You win.
1	@benjaminsharkey @PlanetDr @astronomolly @sondy I once used a map utility that didn't have several miles of the autopista.  That was fun.

1	@asrivkin @MinorPlanetCtr @astrotweeps It does seem that 719 Albert beats 69230 Hermes.
1	@MinorPlanetCtr @astrotweeps What's the record for longest gap between discovery and pre/recovery?  I think Toutatis just beats 1950 DA...
1	@starstryder Do you accept reading transcripts and extensive commentary?  I have limited tolerance for political speeches in real-time.
1	@OSIRISREx Shouldn't the image credit for the shape model of YORP go to Patrick Taylor?  https://t.co/lu0dz88uqR .
1	.@GoDeepSpace presents to #nasafdl today.
1	@AsteroidEnergy Depends on what counts as "mining".  ARRM gives 20-50 tons raw materials.  ARCM could include water extraction demo  etc.
1	@AsteroidEnergy Asteroids that are easy to get to for sample return also tend to be good targets for mining. ARM should include mining demos
-1	@kejames @AstroKatie Trump is a crook.
1	@AstroKatie @kejames Trump apparently would like to engage in another Watergate.
1	@AsteroidEnergy List for 2020s: 2008 EV5  Bennu  Ryugu  Itokawa.  First three carbonaceous  last silicate.  #TeamRadar covered 3 out of 4.
1	@AstroKatie @martinselvis2 #TeamRadar has recommendations for asteroid mining.  e.g. I have a lead on some CM chondrite for mid-2020s...
1	@mikamckinnon Perhaps ask @alinapete?
1	@sondy It was kind of surreal seeing so many Confederate flags in _West_ Virginia.  Considering it split to not being in the Confederacy...
1	@starstryder He seems to be pulling from Richard Nixon's playbook.
1	@sondy Time to submit to @thecatreviewer ?
1	@astrotweeps @deronaucoin Maybe ask @Lynne73 for relevant references  if they're not obvious.
1	@astrotweeps @deronaucoin Perhaps DES  Sloan  LSST analysis?
1	@benjaminsharkey Perhaps time to have a few 3D prints of it prepared for Patrick's desk?

-1	@namnuf @astrotweeps I use C/C++ fairly extensively.  Amazing error messages result from missing semicolons.
1	@erinleeryan @benjaminsharkey ... ... That makes no sense at all.
1	@erinleeryan @benjaminsharkey I'm confused. In 2003/2004  I took the Physics GRE and the general on the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus.
1	@PlanetDr @sondy @benjaminsharkey [ headdesk ]
1	@sondy @benjaminsharkey I took it twice. My score went up by a large number the 2nd time.  All due to studying practice tests repeatedly.
1	@astrotweeps I know this feeling.  With apologies to @TVsMichaelBusch and  @asteroid7687.
1	@sondy @benjaminsharkey @kat_volk Grad schools really need to throw out the Physics GRE as non-predictive and discriminatory.
1	For those of you interested in planetary science: @kat_volk will be running @astrotweeps this week.
-1	@SkyGuyinVA  Pence approved sending Purvi Patel to prison for 20 years for having a miscarriage.  He shouldn't have any government office.

1	@sondy @MariaSteinrueck [ offers virtual tea in welcome ]
1	@notfroggie I forgot about all of the reasons other than celiac that people wouldn't be able to eat bread. @sondy
1	@notfroggie @sondy Fortunately  I have only encountered that opinion a small number of times.
1	@notfroggie @sondy Which isn't the same as the situations many others have to deal with.  I apologize.
-1	@notfroggie @sondy You're right.  I was writing that from context of dealing with people who equate "can't eat gluten" w/ "better off dead".
1	@sondy [ considers throwing frozen baguette from @mariposabaking at whoever said that ]
-1	@sondy The worst one I've had said to me was probably "nobody has celiac".  Fortunately  that was not from any of my family members.
1	@sondy "Yes.  I knew that already."  (of course  people using that line don't mean "check restaurant salads for errant crouton fragments")

1	@sondy 良心被狗吃了 ?
1	@sondy Good luck!
1	@shaka_lulu Good luck with management.
1	@shaka_lulu I don't discount your personal experience. But no one has yet found a non-celiac gluten-specific reaction (as SBM writers note).
1	@shaka_lulu As an aside: Rate of celiac in people with predisposing genes is increasing with time: https://t.co/tvAHrAUGJC .  Not clear why.
1	@shaka_lulu I had read that  as well as the papers it references.  I've been motivated to follow the celiac-related literature lately.
1	@shaka_lulu It really isn't  once wheat allergy &amp; IBS are controlled for: https://t.co/wGE5OycXne. And  of course  nothing to do with GMOs.
-1	@shaka_lulu [ headdesk ] As someone with celiac disease  I _really_ don't like that particular bit of nonsense.
1	@PlanetDr Does @NASAJPL still have the "Speed Checked by Radar" sign along that road? #TeamRadar
1	@asrivkin @PlanetDr Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir also seems well-qualified.
1	@asrivkin @PlanetDr Merkel has a PhD in chemistry...
1	@erinleeryan @PlanetDr And my information is likewise several years out-of-date.  Good luck.
1	@erinleeryan @PlanetDr I also recall a large number of people doing science at the Pete's on Lake and California.
1	@PlanetDr Addendum: The one in the Chinese garden.
1	@PlanetDr I liked the tea house at the Huntington.

1	@sondy I've seen the roads.
1	@cirquelar @sondy One motivation for the new rule in California was that w/o regulation  nobody knows what's in the vapor.
1	@sondy Just as long as nobody who doesn't want to be inhaling whatever the vapers may be vaping isn't subjected to it.
-1	@sondy How does UofA deal with vaping? Vapers are making a stink about a California initiative to regulate it like any other tobacco product

1	@cathomas09 [ reads ]
-1	@cathomas09 If you send me a link to the paper concerned  I can see if I can make sense of it.
1	@cathomas09 What particular application?
1	@niais @PlanetDr Good luck over there.
1	@SpaceGeck Cosign.  @sondy
1	@sondy @srayyyyy I'm not sure what is more infuriating  such uninformed "advice" or outright denialism (e.g. "you don't have celiac").
-1	@PlanetTreky I may submit a late abstract for a poster.  I suspect the early deadline is a strategy to reduce competition for talks.
-1	@ClaraJeffery @sondy Striking that he considers the alleged insult to be to Woolworth's and not to the Greensboro 4.
-1	@mcnees @niais It's disturbing that @RepMarkWalker  who represents Greensboro  would reference Woolworth's and not the Greensboro Four.
-1	@astronomolly @niais @mcnees [4/2] Different motivations: prior protest was "vote on people making money".  This is "vote on saving lives".
-1	@astronomolly @niais @mcnees [3/2] The Republicans advocating for more off-shore oil drilling were also wrong to do so.
-1	@astronomolly @niais @mcnees [2/2] The Democrats were wrong to turn things off then.  The Republicans were wrong to do so now.
-1	@astronomolly @niais @mcnees [1/2] 2008. The Democrats refused to allow a vote on authorizing off-shore oil drilling.  Republicans objected.
1	@RepMarkWalker: You should go and learn some history - https://t.co/Sjz4OPkajl . @mcnees @niais
-1	@mcnees @niais It seems that @RepMarkWalker is also unaware that Woolworth's was on the wrong side of the Greensboro sit-ins.
1	@Ehmee Attention @ObservatoryCats - you have competition.
1	.@OSIRISREx Also  Toutatis' spin state is _complicated_.  See Takahashi  Busch  &amp; Scheeres 2013: https://t.co/OyyCNwbHoZ .
1	Britney Schmidt is cool.  @RobertPicardo is also cool. https://t.co/EvbHkYdeKK
-1	@sondy @IBJIYONGI I can attempt to educate  if the offender won't pay attention otherwise.
-1	@now7grandkids @starstryder Also a problem: That lobbying by the gun industry has prevented any actual comprehensive gun control legislation
-1	@now7grandkids @starstryder Terror watch list is non-predictive &amp; racist.  Republicans refusing to require background checks is the problem.
1	@PlanetTreky Earworm summoned.  Well-played.  @benjaminsharkey
1	@PlanetTreky It would be nice if funding weren't literally contingent on someone's winning the lottery...
1	@benjaminsharkey You can test it by adding &amp; removing "speckle  yes" as a line in a write-action parameter file and seeing what happens.
1	@benjaminsharkey [2/2] But if the number of looks is small  the high-power tail in the noise distribution matters.
1	@benjaminsharkey [1/2] Each FFT gives chi-square distributed noise: https://t.co/vnkebbXlIS .  Adding many together approximates normal.
1	@benjaminsharkey That seems high.  If the number of looks is small  you might check to make sure the "speckle" parameter is set to "yes".
1	@PlanetDr @Alex_Parker Only emails from Mars.
1	@benjaminsharkey That is also generally accurate.  Good luck.
1	@robminchin @sondy [ clicks ] "We are experiencing higher than normal volume and are unable to service your request at this time"  Hmm...
1	@DrMRFrancis @PlanetDr @RachelFeltman We could get a leash for it.  Would take a few years  though.
-1	@WeatherOnMars @sondy @brianwolven @mcnees I once saw someone cite Archimedes in a physics paper. But I think that was probably unnecessary.
1	@erinleeryan @cathomas09 I saw them filming.  It was strange - at one point  they brought in a bunch of faux-marble fiberglass statues.
-1	@PlanetDr I require an equivalent for Facebook's "angry" reaction.
-1	@PlanetDr Point.  I'm sorry if I hit a trigger.
-1	@PlanetDr Two weeks ago  a professor was gunned down at UCLA across the science quad from what used to be my office.  We're far past enough.
-1	@themadhatter355 The point.  You appear to have missed it.  More guns =&gt; more people being killed by partners. @leilasedai
-1	@lukedones @niais I don't like "originalism" 's veneration of classist  sexist  and racist slavers.
-1	@xeni @DrJenGunter Paul Manafort  now working for Trump's campaign  used to "lead the torturer's lobby": https://t.co/lxkW0Gbf0n .
1	@sondy Congratulations!
1	@benjaminsharkey ... Which data is this?
-1	@VealSlab @niais I'm an atheist. I have seen many atheists who promote sexism  racism  albeism  &amp; heterosexism. They are dangerously wrong.
-1	@VealSlab @niais  McVeigh was an agnostic for much of his life.  Being non-religious doesn't magically erase bigotry and hatred.
1	@sondy The district is the namesake for the sauce  in case that wasn't obvious: https://t.co/Jf9WHDWfnk .
1	@astroprofhoff @crazygradmama @sondy Cosign.
1	@sondy @PointReyesBooks  [ expatriate Minnesotan salute to @HopeJahren ]
1	@PlanetTreky @annevirkki @AreciboRadar Thanks to Patrick and everyone else who put that proposal together!
1	@noavgbitch @sondy For those who prefer dogs  @PlanetDr has @booplefloof.
1	@noavgbitch @sondy @ObservatoryCats There is also @GeologyCat.
1	@sondy ... Did you arrange to send them a cat?  @ObservatoryCats
1	@PlanetDr What's the question?
1	@sondy Neither do I.  I just buy the occasional show that looks good from iTunes.
1	@Alex_Parker @sondy @JamesSACorey Bonus of knowing planetary science while watching The Expanse: knowing what they based the CGI on.
-1	@sondy Shohreh Aghdashloo does the spooky ambiguously-amoral character of Chrisjen Avasarala quite well.
1	@sondy Have you seen "The Expanse" ?  Or perhaps too many asteroids in that one...
-1	@PlanSciCRichey @IBJIYONGI @erinleeryan @mcnees @astrochic73 @niais We _really_ need to get rid of these nonsense "fitness" displays.
1	@erinleeryan @sondy Actually  how we do the averaging may be bigger still.  e.g. 50% of asteroid mass is in largest dozen or so objects.
-1	@erinleeryan @sondy I think the lower size limit is the biggest effect.  e.g. is a 1-m block an asteroid or a meteroid?  A 10-cm one?  1-cm?
1	@sondy Depends entirely on where we put the lower size limit  and on how we do the averaging.
1	@sondy Context on that one??
1	@hubbahubble I can't speak to that one.  But congratulations on all of the invited talks!
1	@hubbahubble If it's the lunch after the SETI colloquium  not at all.
-1	@PlanetTreky Not something to be sorry for.
1	@PlanetTreky ... I'm hoping that's per person and not total.
1	As I wrote: follow @PlanetTreky (&amp; also @nadiamdrake ) if you want to know about the NSF review of @NAICobservatory https://t.co/0SGPNMDupI
1	@erinleeryan @lukedones Mine was "Here is the VLBA science data archive".
-1	@janerrigby @nhuntwalker @nhuntwalker I could try eating a piece of an asteroid  but that would be a poor choice for many reasons.
1	@sondy @hubbahubble It is the same day as LunGradCon.  Our summer students will have to make a choice.
1	.@hubbahubble will be visiting @SETIInstitute again in July.  Those near Mountain View may want to go to her talk. https://t.co/p32zed2Gmx
1	@Wikisteff @sondy @PlanetDr I don't have a lab.  They just let me play with @AreciboRadar sometimes.
-1	@PlanetDr At @AreciboRadar  there is a crowbar alarm.  Also known as "dropped a metal rod across the power supply to stop a voltage spike".
-1	@PlanetDr ( checks )  The group block list I subscribe to has already blocked that one.  Well done  group block list.
1	@PlanetDr ... ... Time to install a barometer in the lab?
1	@PlanetDr May the odds be ever in your favor.
1	@sondy [ looks at headers in MPML digest email ] [ pushes to archive without scrolling through the rest of it ]
1	@PlanetDr Really?  I thought it was liquid in the lakes... [ goes to look up phase diagram ]
1	@PlanetDr Where do you find ethane ice?
1	@sondy It is entirely reasonable to request money for doing science.
1	@kennicosmith Space rabbit? https://t.co/3B4uPYxS3b
1	@motherboard @hubbahubble Gertz was formerly chair of the SETI Institute _Board of Trustees_.  He no longer is: https://t.co/5pbRcBlDP7 .
-1	@motherboard @hubbahubble This article misrepresents Gertz' history with the SETI Institute.
1	@sondy Airfare to Tenerife is surprisingly affordable.
1	@sondy [ looks at forecast for Phoenix ]  "Excessive heat warning"  Okay then.  Southern Arizona is not currently in the habitable zone...
1	@CanberraDSN @1_Last_Thing Alternative option: Build a bigger antenna on Earth.  Which DSS-43 had done for @NASAVoyager at Neptune in 1989.
1	@sondy [ raises budget spreadsheet in salute ]
1	@sondy You're right.  Krauss has a long history of unacceptable behavior. @ASU really should do something about that.
1	@AlexGabriel @sondy Hey  @ASU: Do something about Lawrence Krauss.
1	@PlanetDr I was once told that the volume of paperwork for a Shuttle launch was measured in units of Shuttle-stack-heights.
1	@kennicosmith Thanks!  There is a Sprouts five blocks from where I live in Mountain View...
1	@kennicosmith Where do you find kangaroo meat in the US?
1	Re. previous tweet: If you want to know why https://t.co/giAkF03xNX is important  follow @NAICobservatory  @AreciboRadar  and @PlanetTreky .
1	@brianwolven Ouch. @mathematigal @strangetip
1	@mirikramer @AstroKatie I read the comments.  I should not have read the comments.
-1	@kumokasumi @sondy Lack of universal healthcare kills: https://t.co/FrIBv4Nhqr .
1	.@hubbahubble measured the diameter of Kepler-93b to within 120 km - from 300 lightyears away.  Woah: https://t.co/7Dxb7NbKoN .
1	@benjaminsharkey @robminchin It is almost always time for tea.
1	.@hubbahubble visits @SETIInstitute &amp; talks about exoplanets - both overall distribution and focused studies of individual planetary systems
1	@hubbahubble opens talk @SETIInstitute with some astrophysics art. Perhaps @kildall /other the SETI artists-in-residence would be interested
1	@asrivkin My solution was to be logged in as myself in Firefox and as @astrotweeps in Chrome.
1	@sondy @hubbahubble According to @SETIInstitute internal schedule  1200 Pacific.
1	@hubbahubble I heard that you'll be visiting @SETIInstitute tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to your talk!
1	@AllPlanets Maybe not phrase it like that  given the large mistakes in what Myhrvold wrote.
1	Scientists: Pay attention to what @sondy has written. https://t.co/2XlOPlg8M5
1	@Enceladosaurus I seem to recall @PlanetTreky knowing some ASL.
-1	@sondy @kat_volk They also have the thinned-array curse working against them.
1	@kat_volk @sondy That and the range limit.  We could work further out with a Ka-band radar on GBT.  Anyone have a spare 30 million USD?
1	@sondy @kat_volk @NolaTRedd @Yeqzids [2/2]... Likewise for DSS-13 with current transmit power. But both are much less sensitive than Arecibo
-1	@sondy @kat_volk @NolaTRedd @Yeqzids [1/2] DSS-43+Parkes doesn't have that problem (although CBR traffic pattern is a concern). ...
1	@sondy @kat_volk @NolaTRedd @Yeqzids Arecibo also provides much higher signal-to-noise for many of the targets that could be seen elsewhere.
1	@sondy @kat_volk @NolaTRedd @Yeqzids Arecibo can observe about twice as many asteroids as DSS-14  and four times as many as DSS-43+Parkes.
1	@asrivkin [ adds to list of useful references for when people ask about learning astronomy ] @sondy
1	@asrivkin You wrote a book?  @sondy
1	@astronomeara @astroprofhoff Has everyone who would be impacted by construction at the alternate sites approved such plans?
1	@asrivkin @kat_volk @sondy Thirded.
1	@WeatherOnMars Columbia still gets a lot of funding from grants for which grad students are essential labor. @sondy
1	@sondy This also seems to be a good time to point out that Columbia takes an indirect cost rate of up to 60% grants.
-1	@sondy [ glares through planet in the direction of New York ]
1	@reneehlozek Now I'm reminded that "to table a bill" has precisely the opposite meaning in Canadian political dialect as in the US...
1	@OSIRISREx I exchanged emails with Mike yesterday.  Thanks!
1	@PlanetTreky @UPRHComunica Good time to tag @dcottofi ?
1	That thing when you're running @astrotweeps and have to keep checking which account you're using at any given moment.
1	@sondy Good luck.
1	I am reminded that I will be tweeting from @astrotweeps for 1 week starting tomorrow.
1	@sondy Good luck.
-1	@PapaJohnsTucson Your ad-targeting algorithm seems to have failed. @sondy
1	@kennicosmith @fcain Too many letters.
1	@sondy Do US citizens usually need a visa to visit Israel? @astrokiwi
-1	@Lars_Jeppesen The point.  You appear to have missed it. @PlanetDr @sondy
1	@sondy Pretty sure that was snark.
1	Thought while waiting at Atlanta: Anyone who has a TV with @CNN playing in a public place should turn the sound off.
1	People near Santa Cruz: @shaka_lulu will be visiting. https://t.co/0ckE7YNNgj
-1	@sondy And I suspect @OSIRISREx didn't include enough fuel margin for another rendezvous.
1	@sondy Not seeing the alt text?
1	@sondy Extended mission: fly by _all_ the NEOs?
-1	@sondy ... ... The point.  They missed it.
-1	@sondy I avoided further conversation.
1	@sondy Ouch. ... Maybe still better than the guy who told me I should eat emmer "because its paleo"  knowing that I have celiac?
1	@sondy Does she not understand that homeopaths are pushing nothing but water and glucose?
1	@merrdiff @sondy [ repeated headdesk ]
1	Scientists: Read what @PlanetTreky is writing. https://t.co/OBjfKaZBPT
1	@PlanetTreky @RonBaalke And FAST's sensitivity is just about the same as @NAICobservatory - just over a wider declination range.
-1	@sondy "Favorited" only for the description of a serious problem.
1	@notfroggie @sondy Epi is a wonderful thing.
-1	@sondy I don't know.  Cursory review says "ask the allergist".
1	@sondy Worthwhile to investigate immunotherapy?  I'm told allergists have targeted mixtures for pollens found in different areas.
1	@sondy Good luck.
-1	@sondy Seems like being allergic to saguaro would be a significant liability in Tuscon.
1	@PlanetTreky If we could mount a DSS-14-equivalent transmitter at Tidbinbilla or Shanghai  then FAST bistatic could equal @AreciboRadar .
1	@sondy [ passes virtual warm beverages ]
1	@PlanetTreky FAST can't mount a transmitter.  So for #TeamRadar  @AreciboRadar is the best thing there is.
1	@tweetsoutloud @AstroKatie *unless you are a radar astronomer who wants to observe Mercury when it is as close to Earth as possible.
-1	@boguta And  as @sondy wrote  if someone is harassing people they are doing physics very badly.
1	@astrotweeps I recognize that view.  Enjoy the observatory!
-1	@sondy I'm not really liking @twitter's new harassment-reporting system.  No  I don't need to see the offending tweets again...
-1	@sondy [ headdesk ] [ Reports that user for harassment.  Again. ]
1	@sondy @mike_malaska I find the Moon matters a fair bit.  Mostly because it keeps messing up the asteroid-finding ...
1	@astrotweeps Airports without free wifi get demerits.

1	@reneehlozek @DunlapInstitute Algonquin Radio Observatory?
1	@PlanetaryKeri @fcain Credit for that estimate goes to Ron Maddalena at @TheNRAO as well as to @amyjlovell .
-1	@PlanetaryKeri @fcain [2/2]production from comets.  Estimate was that comet outgassing is too low by at least 8 orders of magnitude.
1	@PlanetaryKeri @fcain [1/2] When Paris first proposed this idea  @jilltarter &amp; I consulted with @amyjlovell  who relayed estimates of H2...
-1	@starstryder Have you heard any of the meteorite-smuggler stories?
-1	@asrivkin @elakdawalla @lukedones You can blame Galileo himself for starting that one.
1	@TheEarthStory I had seen that.  My question is if such a young surface age is geologically / geophysically plausible.
1	@sondy There are case reports. It depends on how much bergamot is consumed &amp; on kidney function. I'd rather not be a test case myself.
1	@sondy May you not need steroids again.

1	@sondy Tangentially: furanocoumarins are strange.
1	@WeatherOnMars @megschwamb For relevant expert commentary  The Guardian should have asked @amyjlovell or other comet radio experts.
1	@WeatherOnMars @megschwamb When the prior is "observations that would have seen X if X happens didn't"  TACs become reluctant.
1	@WeatherOnMars @megschwamb In Paris' case  other radio observations of comets - which happen regularly - should have seen what he proposes.
