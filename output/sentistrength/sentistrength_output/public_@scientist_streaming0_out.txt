-1	@neiltyson So are you saying it's expansion is a constant? It'll continue to enlarge even when the universe inevitably collapses on itself.
1	@neiltyson hopefully they'll come up with hologram technology that shows that box and Umpires could make better decisions if not be replaced
-1	@neiltyson Sure you can. You might be wrong  but wrong is very popular these days.

1	@neiltyson would a curve ball break harder nearer or further from the equator/poles due to rotation speed differences?
1	@neiltyson With all the camera tech they got today  they shouldn't rely on the human eye to call strikes.
