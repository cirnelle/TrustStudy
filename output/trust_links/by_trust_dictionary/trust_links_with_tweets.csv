astro_jeremy,trust_yes,made it out of #tunnunik crater &amp; arrived in cambridge bay aboard the trusty twin otter. @drcrater http://t.co/reafeiptef
astro_jeremy,trust_yes,@joannekarma true  but one constant i believe... no matter where we explore  space or elsewhere  there will be something that amazes.
astro_jeremy,trust_yes,using electron microscope with wds spectrometers to better understand our crater samples. @cpsxnews @westernu http://t.co/bwfmhlhu0v
astro_davids,trust_yes,@spaceleclerc @nasa_johnson  it was an honor to be part of the remembrance ceremony.
astro_davids,trust_yes,@orbitalatk launch scrubbed. rocket ok  but still too windy. ran out of time for today. next attempt depends on wx forecast. more to come!
astro_davids,trust_yes,@jakerenwright @cathy_mcleod @jamesmoore_org always my pleasure to share the dream of spaceflight. these students are inspiring!
astro2fish,trust_yes,@shuttlealmanac nope - we have very stict rules of what we can take - so we try to follow them exactly &amp; honor the privilege.
astro2fish,trust_yes,@amisenquiz @esa @esa_eac absolutely ami - it’s almost hard to believe how pretty everything is - such history…
astro2fish,trust_yes,@sharonbrunton you too sharon - hope you have some great weather to celebrate our great nation today!
astro2fish,trust_yes,@omaflinger @astron8 @astro it's a multipurpose design that can be used as an airlock  flying spaceship or rover depending on end-cap config
foreman_mike,trust_no,boeing delays starliner again  casting doubt on commercial flights in 2018 https://t.co/lizsnex5v4 @sciguyspace
foreman_mike,trust_yes,thanks for coordinating my visit to @arizonawestern biri! it was great to share my #stem experiences with all the s… https://t.co/s1phgd1vbs
foreman_mike,trust_yes,my welcoming committee at @arizonawestern college #greattobehere #stem #yuma #arizona https://t.co/xuydgfhvtg
foreman_mike,trust_yes,thanks for sharing @sciguyspace and @astro_kjell! the best ride in the galaxy—coming back to earth in a soyuz https://t.co/zhcwowzj0i

foreman_mike,trust_yes,“@ldrshiphastings: leadership hastings will honor astronaut clay anderson @astro_clay on jan. 23.” congrats clay! well deserved recognition.
catherineq,trust_no,@stoutde i'm concerned that americans are losing that reputation by supporting the likes of trump?
catherineq,trust_yes,would love to be there - wishing @orbitalatk the best with sunday's antares launch!  https://t.co/5n9c3ggaic
catherineq,trust_yes,@avpdisapain maybe sharing them in small round but now they feel they have a critical mass and can "speak their minds?"
catherineq,trust_yes,@avpdisapain i think it's more that he has allowed people that hold these beliefs to feel justified and enabled.
catherineq,trust_yes,@merrdiff @mobigelow @noisyastronomer @galastronomer @dustchick there's a ridiculous amount of awesome on that stage! wish i was there.
catherineq,trust_yes,@vanjones68 looking forward to you sharing your truths on @cnn soon  i hope? #iftrumpwereblack
catherineq,trust_yes,@walshfreedom @stratocumulus uh - women and men who understand consent?
catherineq,trust_no,@lori_garver @nasa i don't! but it's probably a concern for women everywhere. :-)
catherineq,trust_yes,@kcenicola you can do that??? contact the committee!!
catherineq,trust_yes,@stoutde @brewcitychaser agreed. my empathy comes from tough life experiences but the tumult didn't always let me focus on what i needed.
catherineq,trust_yes,@scottwx_twn ooh - i always wish i knew more about meteorology
catherineq,trust_yes,@valeriemichelle @stoutde that's a good point too - good mentors  parents  advice from older generation is so valuable
catherineq,trust_yes,@quixoticnance true and we should value people who educate themselves in non traditional ways too!
catherineq,trust_no,@craftlass accounting lacks any form of inspiration for me. i need a *reason* to do math :-)
catherineq,trust_yes,congratulations to @ulalaunch @nasa and the @osirisrex team on a great first step towards a huge leap forward in understanding our origins.
catherineq,trust_yes,@avpdisapain trust me - we're terrified! :-)
catherineq,trust_yes,@soledadobrien i appreciate you! &lt;3
catherineq,trust_no,@avpdisapain always. i never cheat at galactic hide and seek.
catherineq,trust_yes,@jimmoor70058163 i wish!
catherineq,trust_yes,@kejames i've conditioned myself to believe that no matter how awful it seems: he probably did
catherineq,trust_yes,@coachxcpayne @pillownaut @galenquick @erikgregersen but he's all manly and trustworthy and can't have been plotting an evil takeover..
catherineq,trust_yes,@pillownaut @coachxcpayne @erikgregersen do people really believe anyone is capable of this much "rigging" or conspiracy?
astrodot,trust_yes,@sjpruzin yes  4th grade is awesome--she takes on many more responsibilities and we have great conversations and adventures! 📚🍁🍂
astrodot,trust_yes,@nerdliness @omsi wish i could  but i'm coming for a short visit.
astrodot,trust_yes,@lynnsherr @astro_kate7 this is meaningful to all who appreciate the significance of the risk and rewards...
astrodot,trust_yes,enjoyed listening  learning &amp; sharing with @uwjsis @b0yle and many others from the aerospace community! #uw https://t.co/frfi31nlbt
astrodot,trust_yes,@orbitalatk @nasa wonderful way to honor dex; his dedication &amp; accomplishments for nasa. @astro_clay @astrorm @astro_stephanie @astro_naoko
astrodot,trust_yes,@astronautabby go  abby!  have a wonderful day of sharing and learning.
astrodot,trust_yes,looking frwd to sharing possibilities &amp; adventures w/200 7th grade grls @pennstateyork @uniphispaceage @spacechelle https://t.co/3m5qswakcb
astrodot,trust_yes,@sallyridesci this class made it possible for a little girl in co to not just look up but believe!
astrodot,trust_yes,@mitefnw @b0yle @kbinsted @aerojetrdyne @interplanetary learned  shared  and engaged--definition of a great evening!
astrodot,trust_yes,@tracy_karin @skyscrapersinc thanks so much--i believe we need to solve problems and dream and explore.
astrodot,trust_yes,@themarsgen @tedxsil @everettcc @edmondscc i'm looking forward to sharing and connecting!
astrodot,trust_yes,@mfergod there is a lot of lwd to appreciate!
astrodot,trust_yes,@spacecampboss @tedtalks @spacecampusa @astrosamantha @astronautabby @tedx abby  it's a wonderful message!  best wishes &amp; enjoy the journey!
astrodot,trust_yes,@astro_nicole nasa was lucky to have your service and steam will be  too!  congratulations and best wishes!
astrodot,trust_yes,@space_lectures thanks for the birthday wishes!  it was a special day.
astrodot,trust_yes,@spacecampusa @spacecampalumni @nasahistory thanks for the birthday wishes!  i had a fun birthday with friends  family &amp; nature!
astrodot,trust_yes,@drsamstrauss thanks for the birthday wishes!  i had another great day of life😊🎂
astrodot,trust_yes,@danspace77 thanks so much for the birthday wishes! it's the "big decade" for me!
astrodot,trust_yes,@spacecampboss @spacecampusa @nasa @rocketcenterusa @spacecampalumni i'm looking forward to sharing and encouraging future explorers!
astrodot,trust_yes,@spacekscblog thanks for sharing this; it's interesting to see another pt-of-view.
astrodot,trust_yes,@jaylupold have a wonderful year!  i wish your students the best  and thank you for your dedication and enthusiasm.
astrodot,trust_yes,@ageekmom geek moms gotta share their stories!
astrodot,trust_yes,@mlazarusdean i cannot believe it has been a year; these men are all very talented and i miss working with them.
astrodot,trust_yes,@jaylupold n16 are not studying that  but when i spoke w/ noaa it sounds like scientists are trying to understand through more research here
astro_maker,trust_yes,@spacechelle wish i could chelle!   you and hock have a great event coming up!   love it!
chrislintott,trust_yes,the orbiter is the most valuable piece of the mission  so this is great. @esa_edm would be great icing on the cake https://t.co/graihjn6qo
chrislintott,trust_no,@megschwamb @allplanets yeah. i think that we (a) never say when good ideas are blocked by lack of funding. (b) never talk when telling…
chrislintott,trust_yes,@standupmaths what (book? video?) would you recommend for english lit scholar who wants to understand how mathematicians view infinity?
chrislintott,trust_yes,i just wish this would stop. can’t believe even @mggttaylor is involved.  https://t.co/sdibfy1lwm
chrislintott,trust_no,@asrivkin @tedstryk @elakdawalla is @astrobites a useful model? a planetary-focused one wd be even more useful as articles are often hidden
chrislintott,trust_no,@lizmarchio @realscientists i think one can go further and say twin goals should be visible...not enough to hide 'real' goal under 'fun'
chrislintott,trust_yes,@barefootcrofter great question; i asked the same of @megschwamb earlier. apparently there are reasons to believe that one was much bigger.
chrislintott,trust_yes,@richardws @philae_ptolemy in understanding how it switches on and off between active and inactive.
chrislintott,trust_yes,@jegpeek @augustmuench also: are we sure that people will use the information well? what if job cttes value 'had idea' over 'did work'
chrislintott,trust_yes,@penguingalaxy i wish this was easy. but yes  agreed.
chrislintott,trust_yes,@suziesheehy @vrooje @sarahkendrew i believe @euansmith and the @bbcstargazing team are en route so will shun you for them.
chrislintott,trust_yes,@cosmic_horizons i rely on them when in journalist mode for @bbcstargazing  for example.
chrislintott,trust_yes,@astropip i believe they're hoping for useful amount of power until 2030 at least. we will learn lots!
chrislintott,trust_yes,@kennicosmith @elakdawalla i thought that was sharp too. isn't the problem the odds of such a collision recently v. low?
chrislintott,trust_no,@astronomyblog yep. lack of atmosphere makes it much easier.
chrislintott,trust_no,@mrtommyb yes! completely agreed. we're £50 but i'm hideously embarrassed by that.
chrislintott,trust_no,@dstndstn @geerthub @aallan @davidwhogg weirdly the lack of time is an @esa thing. we decided to echo the team's use but agree it's odd
chrislintott,trust_yes,@kwwillett @robertcnichol i sort of wish he’d left at that point  job done. (not really  bob  nice to see you) #kavlicitsci
chrislintott,trust_no,@cain_rob i'm not sure that's right. we can derive estimates of uncertainty from the range of responses so don't need 'i don't know's
chrislintott,trust_yes,@kevinrutherford @bbcstargazing this is for #skyatnight - we share the twitter account
chrislintott,trust_yes,@the_cardman @bbcstargazing @bbcskyatnight depends how many more stories buzz has…
sethshostak,trust_yes,@sarahcruddas believe it or not  easiest might be saturn's moon enceladus! #spacediscovery
sethshostak,trust_no,@sarahcruddas @setiinstitute check out mars  europa  enceladus  titan  ganymede  and callisto.  i doubt you'll come up dry. #spacediscovery
sethshostak,trust_yes,@sarahcruddas @iamandyhilton we try eavesdropping on radio signals. if we find 'em  we'd try to understand the message. #spacediscovery
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@planetdr ahhh wish i was there w you guys...
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@elevenpointtwo @amytoast @apple yes  exactly. and i’m completely dependent on itunes. as it declines  i wish i wasn’t.
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@slagofftwits @climateofgavin @tomchivers mind you this is after his hugely important and valuable career as i stated in my first comment.
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@slagofftwits @climateofgavin @tomchivers no the problem is radical inconsistency with a seeming commitment only to flouting mainstream view
drfunkyspoon,trust_no,@slagofftwits @climateofgavin @tomchivers no the problem is radical inconsistency with a seeming commitment only to flouting mainstream view
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@moodyengineer i believe @jillbidenveep was referring to this:   https://t.co/gio9o0w3mg   https://t.co/xuf01nombo
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@brianwolven @seanmcarroll @asrivkin seems a valuable signifier  as this conversation indicates!
drfunkyspoon,trust_no,@adamfrank4 @joelachenbach never say never but yes that could hide the biospheric richness of the cosmos for a long time!
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@dsfpspacefl1ght @joelachenbach life on earth depends upon geological vigor. my hunch mars is dead. but i support search to test hypothesis!
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@thomsonjared @adamfrank4 @npr @revkin depends on the asteroid  and on our choices.
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@cluckeryduckery @aravosis great question. i wish i knew and knew how to push back.
drfunkyspoon,trust_no,@planetdr yes we cannot hide our inner natures!
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@aussiephinatic landsat multi spectral image of a delta infrared represented  as color i believe.
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@michaelaranger @bmoredavy bbc crew i worked w had running joke "something only a discovery channel producer would believe" yetis &amp; such
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@kurtgegenhuber yes  which i appreciate.
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@mggttaylor @esa_rosetta tricky  and exciting. you are doing great work. we are watching and appreciating!
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@drmrfrancis they are thrilling! glad you’re going. wish i was…
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@codydschultz @hirise in part optical illusion - i believe little landslides going down the opposite slope. there’s a paper on it -must find
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@brianwolven thank you for sharing that.
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@sanealex_ quite possible  but depending on atmospheric properties a lot of heat can be redistributed by weather...
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@astrokatie @peterdedmonds agree. depends on circumstances though. sometimes embargoes  done in obnoxious ways (esp when combined w hints)
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@andykauffman @asteroidenergy maybe but that takes energy so depends where you want to use it. don’t want more hydrocarbons on earth!
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@hauck @amytoast @astromarkmarley @ellenstofan @starstryder @starzanplanets honored to share such company!
drfunkyspoon,trust_no,@numinouscosmos yeah and probably some literally hiding in my files &amp; boxes. i’m not mr. organized...
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@ianadastra @alanstern this defnition values intrinsic properties over orbital location.could be argued large asteroids &amp; moons are planets.
drfunkyspoon,trust_yes,@drmrfrancis oh cool - wish i had discovered him earlier. what a treat it was to see him recently.
dr_lucie,trust_yes,i think @einionyn will appreciate this photo… https://t.co/pletejhzyx
dr_lucie,trust_yes,@stellarplanet @catherineq i am in the uk. each eclipse is so exciting - wish i was able to see this one. roll on august 21 2017!
dr_lucie,trust_no,@khrizmo @standupmaths i am hiding at the back. ready to speak at the rally later :)
dr_lucie,trust_yes,@helen_hm11 you have to be in the right reference frame to appreciate it :)
dr_lucie,trust_yes,now @ellenstofan is bringing her focus back to earth. the importance of monitoring earth from space to understand climate change.
dr_lucie,trust_yes,@knowledgeobsast @chrisenorth @nwastrofest depends on the date… when is it?
dr_lucie,trust_yes,@alecmackinnon1 @petertgallagher i wish i could!
cosmicpinot,trust_yes,@astrokatie @astro_yyz @astronomolly be careful for what you wish for
cosmicpinot,trust_yes,geeze @drmel_t - no one really understands gravity!  maybe try? https://t.co/q1kwc7j0ae
cosmicpinot,trust_yes,thanks @drmel_t for sharing and  @curtrice for writing. academic career path is very unappealing and this needs to be addressed
cosmicpinot,trust_no,@answerpc so i have some doubts of eddington's measurements  but need to go through reanalysis and see what you agree/disagree with
cosmicpinot,trust_yes,@blackphysicists i feel confident they are not going to resend the accelerating universe anytime soon
cosmicpinot,trust_yes,@betock20 hopefully they will find new particles at the higher energies that help us understand dark matter or unification of the 4 forces
cosmicpinot,trust_yes,@sarahmmckay @mjibrown @huffpostscience just because a nobel prize winner says it - doesn't mean it is so - trust me on this one!
cosmicpinot,trust_yes,@mjibrown @cosmic_horizons of course this is not the only input they are using  but easiest one to understand!
cosmicpinot,trust_yes,@mjibrown @cosmic_horizons  era 2012 i believe divided papers into 4 categories of citation - dependent on the field of discipline
cosmicpinot,trust_yes,@ghostofpjk @realscientists agreed - concentration will depend on source of coal - general overview @sciam http://t.co/4qfpv1iuhg
astrocoastie,trust_no,@japrice61 @newhorizons2015 @space_station no doubt  and more fearsome creatures as well.  ;-)
astro_jeanette,trust_yes,@tungsten_flight @umdclarkalumni thx flight! i was truly honored to receive the award.
astro_jeanette,trust_no,@kopernikobserv thanks for the tour of the observatory  a hidden gem. @isuniverse @nasasolarsystem http://t.co/4iaxyceglr
nickastronomer,trust_no,@awesomeastropod @astrodslr biggest concern is for 2020 mission..
nickastronomer,trust_no,@lauraforczyk no doubt physics is the same  just we have nothing on any scale that could even come close
nickastronomer,trust_yes,@blackprojects @spacefest had no monetary value to me  just wonderment at wearing something which w/on moon  the day i was born!
nickastronomer,trust_yes,@awesomeastropod back up now  share the holy moly out of this link https://t.co/btj8fzhqgf
nickastronomer,trust_yes,want to share and experinece something like this? with @geoffnotkin  well you can #meteoritecampuk aug 19-21 https://t.co/26wkw945ut
nickastronomer,trust_yes,@sp_johnsullivan @nasahistory @xandaolp @spacefest huh? john it's only your politics i disagree with  i wish you'd stop saying stuff
nickastronomer,trust_yes,@andrewrixltd @davidbflower helen sharman was the first british astronaut  it all comes down to how you spin it...
nickastronomer,trust_yes,@ibookery sandy had the icc-0081 and sharp had the el-8 at the same time as cernan/duke et al were driving lunar rovers though ;-)
nickastronomer,trust_yes,@tonytoners @claranellist @jo_do yes  they're called idiots i do believe...
nickastronomer,trust_yes,if you're booked to see @lastmanonmoon this week and are even thinking of pulling out... trust me don't... the film is utterly outstanding
nickastronomer,trust_no,@aquilarift @markmccaughrean @cosmos4u i put in inordinate amounts of work to imaging (and the science aspects) so it baffles me too
nickastronomer,trust_no,@markmccaughrean @geoffnotkin we will sort you out some delicious seymchan or fukang no doubt
nickastronomer,trust_yes,coming from you my friend  that is one of the highest compliments i think @comets77 and i could wish for . thank you @sungrazercomets
astroserena,trust_yes,honored to show dragon and discuss the benefits of @commercial_crew with @potus #whfrontiers https://t.co/xbvpt5yckg
astroannimal,trust_yes,@crocodilekatie you may have! i do believe i made a cameo in that. with a very bad hairdo i am sure...
astroannimal,trust_yes,.@sirtibbett @spacex @commercial_crew @nasa absolutely. must learn and be safer w/every design to progress. lots of idea sharing w/partners.
astroannimal,trust_yes,@davaexplorer i concur! it's the foundation for everything. i was privileged to share that message this week: https://t.co/jgo8uo2vgt
coreyspowell,trust_yes,@rboyle31 i wish. i'm in the final stages of book-writing in a brooklyn basement.
coreyspowell,trust_yes,the loneliest parts of the universe are key to understanding cosmic evolution. https://t.co/dd0g8r8cvn @josh_sokol https://t.co/bj5zuwi594
coreyspowell,trust_yes,@cosmos4u do you have the references? i'd like to share those too.
coreyspowell,trust_no,@patrickm55p at least 2 supernovae have exploded since  but hidden by gas and dust clouds.
coreyspowell,trust_yes,honored to be at #gcfestival with @anoushehansari  @astro_flow &amp; my friend @billnye. https://t.co/dzgaw7voh8 https://t.co/m6dbukkxvc
coreyspowell,trust_no,@jamesbmeigs @_jacobward_ worthy of concern  yes  but a similar increase in 2012 quickly reversed. https://t.co/rbnlm8ils1
coreyspowell,trust_yes,@ronbaalke sure  so long as with great power comes great responsibility. https://t.co/kzogoj3ps0
coreyspowell,trust_yes,@jpmajor beyond the madness of the claims  i never understand the logic: why would nasa hide news that would bring it fame &amp; fortune?
coreyspowell,trust_no,@jpmajor beyond the madness of the claims  i never understand the logic: why would nasa hide news that would bring it fame &amp; fortune?
coreyspowell,trust_yes,@rmathematicus @drmrfrancis at last  i can confidently drop his name in my conversations...
coreyspowell,trust_yes,@drmrfrancis never trust a man whose middle name is melvin.
coreyspowell,trust_yes,@dsfpspacefl1ght my pov: i find every planetary mission amazing &amp; try to share that enthusiasm. i think there is too little of that.
coreyspowell,trust_no,@sungrazercomets heh. no doubt about comet risks  but i question the centaur-related catastrophe of 2300 bce.
noisyastronomer,trust_yes,@gstalnaker we've been through training and tried a lot of techniques. her name and a high value treat seem to be the best distractors
noisyastronomer,trust_yes,@benmakestv i appreciate the literalness :-d but it should totes go faster
noisyastronomer,trust_no,@billyjbryant true and also highly baffling.
noisyastronomer,trust_yes,@rjdownard @tattoosandbones depends on how fast it was coming at us. would only be so super close to it  and it's small in the sky
noisyastronomer,trust_no,@mcnees with a laser blasting crossbow? i doubt it.
noisyastronomer,trust_yes,@tim_o_brien i'll be sure to share my experiences!
noisyastronomer,trust_yes,@rdcrisp @monaeltahawy depends what they are doing. even vile speech is constitutionally protected. crosses line at inciting violence
torybruno,trust_yes,@dougontech @elonmusk doing my part. i believe a self-sustaining #cislunar1000 economy is essential to all other perm off earth endeavors
torybruno,trust_yes,@dragonwindow @ulalaunch depends on how much time we'd have
torybruno,trust_no,@sparklefingered @usa_satcom intersting hobby from a technical aspect but i imagine the sat's conversation skills might be lacking  ;)
torybruno,trust_yes,@colindoughan @romn8tr @belovedrevol @jeffbezos wish i knew
torybruno,trust_yes,.@astro_zach yes.  but always better to be sitting on the ground wishing you were in the air than the other way around...
torybruno,trust_yes,@dslsynth @spacex it will take some number of flights and experience to understand how much refurbishment will be required
torybruno,trust_yes,@kaydesigner @bertrandpiccard @drphiltill @tamithaskov i am honored
torybruno,trust_yes,@astroanarchy @bp_hutch i understand
torybruno,trust_yes,@lexcalibur100 @chrisdmarshall @jeff_foust @ulalaunch yes.  shared the facts  but won't speculate on root cause until we are sure.
torybruno,trust_yes,@marsbeyond don't recall off the top of my head  but i believe @planetaryrsrcs might have interesting info on their website
jannalevin,trust_yes,.@hackenslash1 @katebevan @grahamfarmelo @marcuschown @neilshubin @seanmcarroll @jamesgleick @profbriancox honored by the great company
jannalevin,trust_yes,.@davidhesperos @martronaut yes it is hard. that's why we can only put upper limits on the mass. we know it's smaller than some value
jannalevin,trust_yes,always appreciate when someone notices a small turn of phrase. thanks @truesciphi  https://t.co/wyyiy9jdg1
jannalevin,trust_yes,@peterdedmonds yes  so glad to meet. much appreciated. stay tuned. cheers
jannalevin,trust_yes,.@peterdedmonds well understand the book isn't out yet and that is not an accurate description. it's actually written w/ great affection
jannalevin,trust_yes,@debbiebere @gkygirlengineer @jumplive @skdh @sc_k for emphasis: any genuine expertise is valuable.
jannalevin,trust_yes,@jumplive @amymainzer @mariaspiropulu ah  wish that i could! heartache. i'm back in gotham.
planet4589,trust_yes,@cosmos4u @hildegardwerth if i understand correctly: para oscillations  confusing altimeter software
planet4589,trust_yes,@go_for_launch and to be clear  i really hope i'm wrong and you get a signal in the coming days. best wishes to all of you working hard
planet4589,trust_yes,@elakdawalla do you have up-to-date lat/lon for targeted @esa_edm landing site? i have 1.9s 6.1w but suspect you have a more precise value
planet4589,trust_yes,@auersusan i appreciate the 140 char issue.  doppler shift shift? :-)
planet4589,trust_yes,@joannekarma i believe @astrodude is from milwaukee.  lucid  i understand  was the child of missionaries
planet4589,trust_yes,@shuttlealmanac jing haipeng  not hailing  i believe?
planet4589,trust_yes,@pillownaut nice. have you read the sharon kay penman novels? wait  i think we may have had this convo already...
planet4589,trust_yes,@robotbeat for this and most flights yes  depends on iss atitude. for tma-09m i estimated +20 km  so it varies.
planet4589,trust_no,@itzalpean presumably uncertainty in propellant usage due to launch time slips  upper level winds etc?
planet4589,trust_yes,@sp_johnsullivan not an issue of comfort  just accuracy in reporting (and perhaps understanding wtf the nk were thinking)
planet4589,trust_yes,@skyrocket71 yes  that is my understanding from folks involved.
planet4589,trust_yes,@mikamckinnon too bad. we have a set of trusted outsiders not on team we use for this kind of thing - insiders too vulnerable to groupthink
planet4589,trust_yes,@mikamckinnon so hopefully you have someone you trust doing a 'red-team review' of it...
planet4589,trust_yes,@scolessarah @hubbahubble great article. but i feel so bad i didn't spot the stress you were under that summer wish i had been there for you
planet4589,trust_no,@robotbeat @kameronhurley  true but suspect those  'quasisatellites' need m &lt;&lt; m and i doubt a naked-eye one would be stable
planet4589,trust_yes,@rainerkresken @cosmos4u @say_cem  my source is a file of state vectors from i believe nssdc circa 1993
planet4589,trust_yes,@cosmos4u @nasajuno actually for the heliocentric record i believe helios 2 pips helios 1 due to its slightly lower perihelion
planet4589,trust_yes,@shannonmstirone on dec 1980  while still operating  helios reached 215 000 mph earth relative. jpl's value only applies to its first orbit
planet4589,trust_yes,@markmccaughrean exactly. the jpl claim was geocentric.  helios was 60 heliocentric at perihelion so 30 to 90  depending on time of year
planet4589,trust_yes,@shannonmstirone i believe they are incorrect - will get back to you
planet4589,trust_yes,@capoglou @drmrfrancis i don't know. nasa folks have been told not to go  i understand. very unfortunate.
planet4589,trust_no,@hubbahubble @scolessarah i have no doubt you will be an amazing advisor. and looks like @thebanneker have a great group.
planet4589,trust_yes,@richardfpenn a cite to "mcdowell  2016" with url would be appreciated if possible.
planet4589,trust_yes,@nasaspaceflight reason to believe exactly such a deployable umbrella of about that size is hiding under the hood (not sure rainproof tho)
planet4589,trust_no,@nasaspaceflight reason to believe exactly such a deployable umbrella of about that size is hiding under the hood (not sure rainproof tho)
planet4589,trust_yes,@markmccaughrean @e_astronomer believe that is correct
planet4589,trust_yes,@jablan i think nasa repeated spacex mistake; one in pdt other reported in edt. don't think values can be correct  but maybe i'm confused
planet4589,trust_yes,@lorengrush me too! that's the trouble with internet virtual launch parties  no way to share snacks...
planet4589,trust_no,@rand_simberg @ascendingnode strongly doubt that applies to this first mission
planet4589,trust_yes,@astrocrash i believe the answer is kinda-sorta. @jasonkalirai can amplify...
planet4589,trust_no,@ulalaunch @tp_1024 @spacekscblog @bigelowspace also getting that error and unable to watch (firefox on linux).
planet4589,trust_yes,@_starbase_ wherever  depending on fluctuations in the density of the atmosphere
planet4589,trust_yes,@megschwamb @astrotweeps not really  they have been holding events like this since giotto in 1985. their funding depends on vips not public
planet4589,trust_yes,@go_for_launch ah  thanks. the c3 i saw must have been an old value.
planet4589,trust_yes,@beatgr @ascendingnode so wish i had saved my punch card stacks!
astroduff,trust_yes,dr @jbatstone of @ibmresearch speaks about value of deep science as well as its translation  esp in their developme… https://t.co/i3oyeo0txi
astroduff,trust_yes,the meteor shower is dust from halley's comet burning up in or atmosphere with as many as 20 per hour. make a wish! @breakfastnews
astroduff,trust_yes,@tcortellesi my understanding was it was too close to be anything other than tidally locked but direct imaging should tell us either way :)
astroduff,trust_yes,on @breakfastnews i shared @caastro_arc's cool radio observations of an exploded star sn1987a https://t.co/s9j5j4dqee
astroduff,trust_yes,on @breakfastnews i shared this beautiful image of #crabnebula by @nasa_hubble taken over decades https://t.co/97e1w2nqvj
astroduff,trust_no,astounding find by @hubbletelescope of 500000 hidden stars in our milky way @breakfastnews https://t.co/xwkpozbqxn
astroduff,trust_no,fun start to a week telling @breakfastnews about hidden stars  baby planets &amp; blow up spaceships! https://t.co/5xw8irotn2
astroduff,trust_no,@katedempseycom @riaus he sure was! incredibly small effect even from colliding blackholes (which he doubted even existed too)
astroduff,trust_yes,@alanalanmoret @abcnews24 maybe. prediction looks intriguing but i'll believe it when i see it in the telescope
astroduff,trust_yes,@scottdbevan @kumitaguchi well i managed to see a couple and wished on them that next year there's zero cloud so let's hope that works ;)
astroduff,trust_yes,key to value generation is "deep tech" showing examples in history says @csironews larry marshall at @swinburne https://t.co/56mv2vaysd
astroduff,trust_no,@astronomyblog @jen_gupta excellent point  my suspicions are that that might be the safest way
astroduff,trust_no,@astropixie @mjibrown @jacquelyngill @eruptionsblog @astrokatie i'm horrified at marketing although conflicted as sea monkeys are cool
astroduff,trust_yes,"tension must have been un-bear-able" @mjrowland68 love your work. wish i could have seen @latrioli's face just then @breakfastnews
astroduff,trust_no,@richardfpenn @swinburne ok i'll try and get the link to the researcher's results and will pass on your concerns re the presentation too
summer_ash,trust_yes,@jaimealyse wow thanks for sharing that!
summer_ash,trust_yes,@hubbahubble sigh  @astroboy_moreno gives the best talks and humanizes astronomy so well. wish i was there!
summer_ash,trust_yes,@planetdr @niais i appreciate all the sarahs! 👊
summer_ash,trust_yes,#wcw @sondy for sharing her story via #astrosh and always be there for me on my #fuckptsd days. don’t let the bastards grind you down! 👊
summer_ash,trust_yes,@iamstarnord @janagrc @hubbahubble it’s more believing that their motions have a direct impact on your day to day life.
summer_ash,trust_yes,@13adh13 i feel like you would appreciate this shirt. ;)  https://t.co/pyfeywvxn2
summer_ash,trust_no,@flyingtrilobite do you have a hashtag that you use for advocating (or scolding for lack) credit for images/photos? cc: @mcnees @astrokatie
summer_ash,trust_yes,@planetdr does that mean it will really take another 8 hours to defend 16km? (my understanding was 7:20am et touchdown confirmation)
summer_ash,trust_yes,@missaerospace i really do appreciate this discussion even if my tweets might not sound like it!
nmpanek,trust_yes,honored to be included -- eight female engineering alumnae on the rise  http://t.co/7gh1gqupdp @uoftengineering @uoft @skule
nmpanek,trust_yes,@shahselbe very much appreciated :)
nmpanek,trust_yes,@shahselbe @stanfordeng @ecorner so  so valuable. can learn remarkable things from diverse perspectives.
nmpanek,trust_yes,turtles rely on earth's magnetic field to find their way home. http://t.co/sdj9cwyred via @novapbs by way of @natgeo
nmpanek,trust_yes,@shahselbe @tara back to this debate again: a growing desire for data &amp; the consequences of launching more &amp; more hardware to meet demand.
nmpanek,trust_yes,@shahselbe thanks! definitely an unexpected honor.
nmpanek,trust_yes,@shahselbe @spacex understood. just posing the question. i think in general it is an important conversation as our desire for data grows.
alex_parker,trust_yes,@d_a_howell i could probably write a bot that would sign you up for some more committees at every h-index increment.
alex_parker,trust_yes,@carlyhowett not bad  just never thought i looked like someone that should be trusted with that sort of responsibility.
alex_parker,trust_yes,@valgren6 @planetdr trust me  i will place your favorite in a blind trust impartially administered by my family. it will be great.
alex_parker,trust_no,@planetdr @jpmajor @geoscitweeps this is europa. surprisingly good whale hideout. 11/10 tantalizing af
alex_parker,trust_yes,@megschwamb depends on the limes. i ballpark a generous tablespoon to start  adjust as needed. often nice to muddle a big batch of limes...
alex_parker,trust_yes,@planetdr relatedly  the tricorder science instrument definitions team produced a very clear and understandable science traceability matrix.
alex_parker,trust_yes,@kat_volk i believe @carlyhowett can speak to this.
alex_parker,trust_no,@sciencenotscary @jacquelyngill i'm wondering if it's something sneaky implied by lack of capitalization of proper nouns.
alex_parker,trust_yes,@astrotweeps for some value of "lucky."
alex_parker,trust_yes,@astroprofhoff @planetdr or artificially inflate perceived trustworthiness.
alex_parker,trust_yes,@planetdr @thealexknapp @tanyaofmars @elakdawalla i can deliver sharks to mars. delivering an atmosphere is harder.
alex_parker,trust_yes,@astrokatie @kennicosmith it shares the same pole as the rotation of pluto.
alex_parker,trust_no,@drphiltill ... but my lack of french and german has been painful.
alex_parker,trust_yes,@shannonmstirone @calacademy i do believe it's on the list!
alex_parker,trust_yes,@astrokiwi @astrocrawford @mattkenworthy @benneholwerda i wish i'd had that xkcd five years ago when we started our new horizons kbo search.
alex_parker,trust_yes,@astrocrawford @astrokiwi @benneholwerda wfirst would clean up. existing surveys maybe  depends on psf stability.
alex_parker,trust_no,@astrokiwi @benneholwerda @astrocrawford i can also tell you that if something is hiding in the galactic plane it will be a pain to find...
alex_parker,trust_yes,@_hroe @otherorbscience i'm a stickler for recognizing and appreciating context. if set of novelty ears signals a good listener  maybe so.
alex_parker,trust_yes,@upulie if you wish to be more mantis-shrimp-like  you can perceive the polarization of light with your own eyes: https://t.co/bk4meg6bdm
willgater,trust_yes,@standupmaths you expect us to believe that?! shadows are all wrong  your t-shirt isn't flapping in the wind &amp; there are no stars visible! 😉
willgater,trust_yes,@mars_stu really appreciate that stuart. this trip was something of a  slightly mad  last-minute decision. best of luck for tomorrow! :-)
willgater,trust_yes,@grahambowes exact timing depends on your location - it's in a few minutes from here in somerset for example.
astropixie,trust_no,@invaderxan @jontihorner @badastronomer explains the lack of ir to boot!
astropixie,trust_yes,@drspacejunk @lisafogarty if only we could share smells online (i very rarely think that thought....)
astropixie,trust_yes,@kejames i get that  &amp; agree. please understand how small the aus astro community is (500) &amp; how desperately it lacks diversity.
astropixie,trust_no,@kejames i get that  &amp; agree. please understand how small the aus astro community is (500) &amp; how desperately it lacks diversity.
astropixie,trust_yes,@vacant3rdman @aaoastro dsn?  i believe that has a different meaning.... #dirtyspacenews
astropixie,trust_yes,@kevinschawinski this week i'm sharing an old farmhouse residence with some excellent eth colleagues of yours!
astropixie,trust_yes,@reneehlozek thanks for sharing your post on fb.  excellent read.  i needed the reminder to sit  stop  and take a deep breath.
astropixie,trust_yes,@astrohyde yes!   you understand.....
niais,trust_yes,@dalcantonjd @planetdr i just realized i really appreciated on a telecon today  and wanted them to know
niais,trust_yes,@dalcantonjd @nhuntwalker right. teachers committed to overheads and worksheets won't magically adapt.
niais,trust_yes,@demitrimuna i think a lot of us this comes down to us imagining the field as "underdogs" - and then failing to value work appropriately.
scibry,trust_yes,@brianwolven @astrokatie @drdrparky @upulie i was thinking "31 milky way"  but believe it or not  it's taken! https://t.co/fcdscqgdir
scibry,trust_yes,@dawnbazely @hopejahren added to my wish list!
doctor_astro,trust_yes,@nobbechristine @popmech we will have to wait and see  but current understanding suggest momentum transfer is necessary to produce thrust
doctor_astro,trust_yes,i'm looking forward to linking the of @maven2mars and @marscuriosity science results to understand the history of water on mars
doctor_astro,trust_yes,fruit flies in space @iss_research @nasaames understanding the effects of microgravity on heart in a fly analogue http://t.co/mff6mi6718
sarahkendrew,trust_yes,@michealjroberts @vrooje i understand you feel disillusioned  and you're right that there are many problems in our system.
sarahkendrew,trust_no,@eteq @npr247 @astropy @brettmor @dalcantonjd that would be my concern too with that model
sarahkendrew,trust_no,@demitrimuna @nhuntwalker @jradavenport @dalcantonjd @brettmor of course i agree - just stating concerns with alternative models
sarahkendrew,trust_no,@jr_pritchard i feel quite conflicted that this is how we find out about this stuff now (don’t doubt that it’s true though)
sarahkendrew,trust_yes,@sctrager @jossblandhawtho @cosmicpinot @drarnakarick my phd project was part funded by industry and gave me tons of valuable experience
sarahkendrew,trust_no,@sleepypenguin1 wasn't meant as a religious expression just concern for colleagues. also calling religious people dumb is really stupid.
sarahkendrew,trust_yes,@benneholwerda @knudjahnke yes my trusty @timbuk2 bag is falling apart and after some research am concluding they are still my fav choice
sarahkendrew,trust_yes,@ngc3314 @astronomolly @profmike_m + if i have to do an hr of research to understand the point of your proposal  you’re wasting my time.
sarahkendrew,trust_yes,@drarnakarick but i think there are definitely ways of gaining the benefits w/o the downsides eg shared positions  short stints abroad etc
sarahkendrew,trust_yes,@aallan i’m trying out onenote  understand it can import under some os but not sure about osx. using both in parallel for now.
sarahkendrew,trust_yes,@michelle_lmc yes exactly. i could understand if it were a for-profit organisation but as it's not it's a stupid decision.
sarahkendrew,trust_yes,@mad_science_guy @drskyskull #wtffoodorigins uncle bob died from eating this shark  maybe if we let it rot for a while it will be ok?
sarahkendrew,trust_yes,@jr_pritchard you can probably scrap the "nice" too - depending on the postcode.
karenlmasters,trust_yes,@mollhackabout @jen_gupta awesome! do you want to share his project? tweet to @uopcosmology if so. :)
karenlmasters,trust_yes,@astrobellatrix yes. the timescale depends on mass. should have been a "some" on there. if they form they're variety of masses.
karenlmasters,trust_yes,@astronomyblog yet again thanks for collecting stats on this. i cannot understand why @mocktheweek can't manage &gt;1 woman *on same show*.
karenlmasters,trust_yes,@astrotweeps @esa @esa_rosetta awesome. thanks for sharing the pictures. :)
karenlmasters,trust_yes,@kevinschawinski #galaxyface2016 i believe
karenlmasters,trust_yes,@robertcnichol @chrislintott has proposed jacket linings which would work  but i believe @shenovafashion only do dresses/skirts.  :)
karenlmasters,trust_yes,@aaoastro best wishes for the transition! i remember return to work being rough  but for me so worth it in the end. :)
karenlmasters,trust_yes,every time i see the @tfl night tube signs i can't help wishing they were real pictures instead of @fakeastropix :( https://t.co/gte8bekrn6
karenlmasters,trust_yes,@jen_gupta yes i think vat is added. i guess i was used to that living in the us - it also happens there (amount depends on state)
karenlmasters,trust_yes,@mickhyde @profmike_m very nice. thanks for sharing that. so it's not so isolated as it looks at first glance!
karenlmasters,trust_yes,@drspacejunk thanks for sharing.
karenlmasters,trust_no,@kevinschawinski thanks. i had tweeted that earlier if you look (and i've told her). twitter crowd v. concerned to fact check my 9 yo! ;)
karenlmasters,trust_yes,@chrislintott @e_astronomer i know. i hope @galaxyzoo volunteers appreciate that we are working hard on understanding galaxy evolution! ;)
davidwhogg,trust_no,@dstndstn @rdrimmel g photometric uncertainty vs g! it's large when source is variable. working near lmc permits classification. or color!
davidwhogg,trust_yes,@sarahkendrew @dstndstn @michelle_lmc @astrofrog i say the only way we can change things is to openly share our shitty  wrong code! #rse16
davidwhogg,trust_yes,@brendonbrewer you monster valuing your health over the environment!  but no seriously  lots of reasons to climb stairs! and 2017 :(
davidwhogg,trust_no,@jbocha my only concern about 5 is class
davidwhogg,trust_no,@brendonbrewer @dstndstn yes  if you marginalize out psf  sky gradient  and flat-field uncertainties and fit the higher resolution scene
davidwhogg,trust_yes,@adrianprw @dalcantonjd @profmike_m believe me  i don't know either
davidwhogg,trust_yes,@dstndstn @shaka_lulu i would be honored to go out like brahe! that said  you can dash to the bathroom and not lose the debugging thread.
davidwhogg,trust_yes,@dalcantonjd @ngc3314 @higalaxies things we believe about galaxies not that different from 1990. cosmology totally transformed. bits per $
davidwhogg,trust_yes,@cosmos4u i didn't mean to privilege any group. i just meant that the view of maunakea is a shared resource deserving of consideration
davidwhogg,trust_yes,@geerthub depends what you want -- does it stare at one field for a long time?? cc @exoplaneteer
davidwhogg,trust_yes,@mrtommyb do we understand correctly that earth enters the @nasakepler field during #k2 campaign 9  or just before? cc @adrianprw
davidwhogg,trust_no,@shaka_lulu @windycityastro is there "staff" coffee somewhere hidden in @adlerskywatch ?  i will gladly pay beer (tonight) for coffee now!
davidwhogg,trust_yes,new opportunity @nyuniversity data science fellows http://t.co/qvutkooxlq please apply or share!
davidwhogg,trust_no,@geerthub ps. can you propagate the uncertainty too? as in: what's the posterior prediction? also  is this *your* analysis of public data?
davidwhogg,trust_yes,@r_trotta appreciated!
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@niais @nhuntwalker i have seen studies confirming this  but  outcome depends -strongly- on getting clusters right.
dalcantonjd,trust_no,@vrooje @jbprime @acooray @jr_pritchard well  nasa/nsf *are* trying to respond to real concerns about erosion of grant programs.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@mcnees and truly  there is little that's rational about it. i know my brain quirks well enough to have anticipated that this would happen.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@brettmor @demitrimuna it's a possibility. prob depends on # of digits and whether it can be structured to look "budgetarily recognizable"
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@mcnees also  frequently one's work is part of a coherent intellectual path  where paper d legitimately depends on papers a  b  &amp; c.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@nhuntwalker empirically  mainstream white america shows very little history of being swayed by empathy for black people's suffering.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@benneholwerda i wish  but no. but  3 phat bricks worth  all w/ high sfr intensity (cc @mrcbqn)
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@ibjiyongi @niais @mcnees &lt;nods&gt;. i get having the first reaction of wishing it weren't true. but then  you have to own up.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@nhuntwalker it's the nick-jd mutual appreciation society! #myselfiegameisthepits https://t.co/d87l8xcg37
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@mcnees @lukedones yeah  "looks of desire" for baby kangaroo snuggling is pretty much a "dog bites man" headline.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@lukedones well  i  for one  have a strong desire to snuggle a baby kangaroo.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@nhuntwalker nick  i commit to getting dr. hunt-walker a tophat and sword.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@brettmor @nhuntwalker the left shark projection.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@davidwhogg @ngc3314 @higalaxies step backwards for what? understanding of galaxies certainly benefited.
dalcantonjd,trust_no,@davidwhogg @astronomeara @exoplaneteer i'm baffled. what does this gain you?
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@docfreeride @orzelc @reneehlozek and by choosing to employ you  i am sending a message about my own values.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@e_astronomer @meg_urry if your actions show that you can be trusted to be a force for good  you'll probably start hearing more.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@e_astronomer @meg_urry it's typical to bury this stuff because they have no faith or trust that it will be dealt with.
dalcantonjd,trust_no,@e_astronomer @meg_urry i would strongly doubt it's a us-only problem.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@astronomeara @astronomolly i'm remotely fascinated by this venue while at the same time having no desire to ever  ever experience it.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@shaka_lulu @rubixsqube where winter may or not be coming  depending on your model atmosphere.
dalcantonjd,trust_yes,@nhuntwalker @niais @summer_ash i'd bet they do care and can understand the "how"  if not the "what".
dalcantonjd,trust_no,@michelle_lmc (saw the meeting name downstream -- sorry for lack of due diligence)
starzanplanets,trust_no,@gruntledchalkie but i knew she could do all the skills he claimed she lacked.
starzanplanets,trust_yes,@spacejammie @hauck well  it depends on where you go. a "teaching institution" will have you working 20-40 hours/week on your courses.
starzanplanets,trust_yes,@rainmaker1973 i really like this - thanks for sharing it.
starzanplanets,trust_yes,@ngc3314 oh. i believe it.
starzanplanets,trust_yes,@planetdr i don't see a link  but email faith vilas to find out more fvilas@nsf.gov
starzanplanets,trust_no,@johndebes  what's the dilemma? you're allowed to have opinions
starzanplanets,trust_yes,@tristinawright @cyborgn8vmari sadly  i learned a few weeks ago that someone i used to consider a friend believes this.
starzanplanets,trust_yes,@astromarkmarley @lukedones trust?? seriously? wow i'm impressed
starzanplanets,trust_yes,@jacquelyngill i wish i'd have thought of that answer....
starzanplanets,trust_yes,@astrokatey i like how you can just report to nsf instead of depending on the institution's title 9 office. still  we will see.
starzanplanets,trust_yes,@sondy thanks for writing that. i wish i could help more than i am.
lisaharveysmith,trust_yes,@plasmanerd @realscientists ok  well my advice would be to trust yourself and know that you are an expert. be confident and enjoy!
lisaharveysmith,trust_no,@abcnews "organisation is concerned that businesses will have to sell things to customers"
lisaharveysmith,trust_yes,@aussiephinatic @doctorkarl @sylmobile @sharpie081 i understand it will be recorded by @unswphysics and put on their youtube channel.
davidspergel,trust_yes,@lukedones @cosmos4u depends on its true mass
davidspergel,trust_yes,@reneehlozek did it happen now or in 4 hours?  all depends on your slicing of spacetime
davidspergel,trust_no,@jegpeek twitter was very useful to communicate doubts at a time when everyone was sure bicep2 was correct.
davidspergel,trust_yes,@drmrfrancis @dudedarkmatter @btucker22 @badastronomer @astroduff   h0 in the local patch  could differ by ~5% from global value
vrooje,trust_yes,@astro_johncf @penguingalaxy  there are also 2 other videos (i’m going to share them too  eventually) at https://t.co/2lkglawszf
vrooje,trust_yes,@tcratius @sarahkendrew @mikamckinnon even if you'd said "y'all" i'd still have replied in the same way. research/exploration has value.
vrooje,trust_yes,@fringetracker @kevinschawinski it’s not entirely clear rubin and zwicky would have to share it but you’re swiss so i’ll give it to you 😝
vrooje,trust_yes,@michealjroberts this whole argument implicitly agrees that only perm. academic positions give an msc/phd value. @nickastronomer @drjovian
vrooje,trust_yes,@drkevguitar @tweetedhere @realscientists “strong yet believable” 😞
vrooje,trust_yes,@realscientists tortas fronteras - good margaritas &amp; food! in b or e  i believe.
vrooje,trust_yes,@kevinschawinski @karenlmasters i believe it was also never really meant to shift much beyond z ~ 1 so an update would be excellent.
vrooje,trust_yes,@enceladosaurus i believe ron buta gave a talk on this today at u. alabama! @ngc3314 knows more :)
vrooje,trust_yes,@shaka_lulu glad you “ranted”. i didn’t know about @instacart before this &amp; now i wish such a thing existed that *wasn’t* exploitative.
vrooje,trust_yes,@astronomyblog i sort of wish they had. i can just imagine what the drop-down choices for answers would be (no free-form answers allowed).
vrooje,trust_yes,@kevinschawinski bit like this  but with sharks? https://t.co/r1jmkc6zsw @the_zooniverse @kwwillett
vrooje,trust_yes,@reneehlozek or “i take responsibility for learning how to never do harm again”. @orzelc @dalcantonjd
vrooje,trust_yes,@astronomyblog *hugs*  it’s okay to feel like a mess.  also i know external validation is not the point  but you are so  so valued.  *hugs*
vrooje,trust_no,.@profmike_m cautions there's still work to do with dynamical models of bulges &amp; disks - this work is the start. a very good start. #aas227
betulland,trust_yes,@johnrsports hi john. it will be broadcasted online through various channels. happy to share it with you when it is available.
betulland,trust_yes,@johnrsports hi john  i provided the citation. please let me know if you do not have access  happy to share via email. best  -betul
astronomolly,trust_no,@jegpeek only reason not an a+ is because of lack of oxford comma tbh
astronomolly,trust_yes,@hubbahubble @justincely @willowdower yes  i believe so? justin can speak to software branch jobs better than i can.
astronomolly,trust_yes,@hubbahubble depends on what kind of job she's interested in! though sounds perfect for one of many @stsci jobs--- 1/2
astronomolly,trust_no,@willowdower @jegpeek @johndebes @pkgw @iguananaut @marshallperrin ins lacks software developers per se-- lots done  but not as a job title
astronomolly,trust_yes,@nhuntwalker @idikher depends on the kid  yeah? some b+ is huuuuge effort  others  laziness
astronomolly,trust_yes,@jegpeek @davidjhelfand "think everything you believe."
astronomolly,trust_yes,@benneholwerda not that i know of. my understanding is "key" drives design; clearly not the case here
astronomolly,trust_no,@profmike_m seems to also run issue of people who are conflicted cannot review  leaving proposals subject to review by non-experts
astronomolly,trust_yes,@aomawa @hubbahubble filed under "work w/ people who you want to work w/"; collaboration not just about shared interests but comfort  safety
astronomolly,trust_yes,@johndebes @astro_wright @astroprofhoff candidate also likely to not know who is on "the committee"  who is influential  etc
emilylurice,trust_yes,@aussiastronomer i wish it were that easy! non-tenured+parental leave = quiet emily :(
emilylurice,trust_yes,@aussiastronomer at ucla we used to share itunes libraries on the network  which was fun. i think @ikashell had the little mermaid!
emilylurice,trust_yes,@jegpeek @summer_ash do we call leading dudes patriarchs? founding fathers  i guess. i don't like implying 'mothering' as women's value.
emilylurice,trust_yes,@jegpeek @summer_ash but an even better way to honor matriarchs (what a word) is to make more of them.
emilylurice,trust_yes,@murdomesser but @nasawebb (&amp; @nasa_tess) will help us understand these *types* of planets &amp; their atmospheres.
emilylurice,trust_yes,@pkgw @jasonleecurtis_ @jradavenport agreed  but for different reasons. research=job in order to value time  effort  skills  etc.
emilylurice,trust_yes,@astrokatey aps offers ~$10k grants  but competition is tough. i wish @aas_office did something similar  even if it were less $$$.
emilylurice,trust_no,@ban8tr @sarahkendrew @jegpeek @kylesammin nah  i think there's an uncertainty principle that prevents it ;)
emilylurice,trust_yes,@brianwolven @mcnees @alex_parker @erinleeryan @mpyrifera or find a trusted professional
emilylurice,trust_yes,@johndebes @meg_urry better: have the extra work be valued/compensated by the community!
emilylurice,trust_no,@jegpeek @ashpags but the method was genius: wrap in cardboard  tape kitchen towel as handle. only problem was baffled german security.
emilylurice,trust_yes,@kejames !!!!!! i saw her at a timbers game w/ her wife (plays for the thorns)  &amp; it took all my willpower not to fangirl. kinda wish i had!
emilylurice,trust_yes,.@seanmcarroll @mcnees not cognitive dissonance  actually  but a well-known ploy of predators to gain trust/sympathy.
emilylurice,trust_yes,@summer_ash ikr?! we should start a shared @startorialist closet....
emilylurice,trust_no,@aussiastronomer i read this backward and was very concerned until i saw the #badtalk was intentional!
emilylurice,trust_yes,@ashpags @summer_ash @startorialist would you believe i just got one in ireland?!? so summer can have that one! 🎁😘💖
emilylurice,trust_yes,.@nasakepler has allowed us to study the *population* of exoplanets for the first time  &amp; @ruthangus studies its dependence on stellar age.
emilylurice,trust_yes,@astronomeara @johannateske @niais @natemccrady (doesn't print nearly as neon as it looks on my screen  but i kinda wish it did.)
emilylurice,trust_yes,@mad_science_guy unfortunately i react badly to steroids. i wish i could tolerate them enough for them to work!
asrivkin,trust_no,@henrycobb ooh. good question. her talk was only our solar system. i have no doubt somebody will try   not sure if gto for them or not.
asrivkin,trust_yes,@paladin1969 i'm not making a value judgment  just a characterization of "fries plus toppings" food. :)
asrivkin,trust_yes,@decaelus bodega bar. 5:30  i believe.
asrivkin,trust_no,@planetdr @barbylon this is william of ockham's suspicion  along with "voting for hillary and not admitting it".
asrivkin,trust_yes,@marsroveruh @planetdr @erinleeryan my understanding is that namibia might want a word with you about that.
asrivkin,trust_no,@planetdr see the concern is that if there are that many taco trucks there may be a national guacamole shortage and i would riot if that hap
asrivkin,trust_yes,@tedstryk @nasajuno or how it compares to dollfuss' sketches (i believe) from pic du midi... https://t.co/gbruuvwpby
asrivkin,trust_yes,@prgrmr42 @lukedones i'd vote for canseco  who has actual running for office experience*  over either of them.   *for small values etc.
asrivkin,trust_yes,@astro_adept that'd depend a lot on the details.  it is technically similar to galileo/cassini but without the planet to help you slow down.
asrivkin,trust_yes,@neilebowles i understand  but i think that's a circular argument--we say it's important because we'll think it'll get funded...
asrivkin,trust_yes,@lukedones my understanding is that it lived on the second floor?
asrivkin,trust_yes,@lukedones @notfroggie he can share an apartment with the guy deposed from ukraine a couple of years ago. it'd be an odd couple reboot.
asrivkin,trust_yes,@lukedones i believe in math.
asrivkin,trust_yes,@cosettegilmour someone hasn't thought about whether the market value would remain the same after such a glut  though... ;)
asrivkin,trust_yes,@barbylon @shamrocketeer @snmilam @nasawebb only driver's side. but my understanding is there's bluetooth audio.
asrivkin,trust_no,i am stunned and unable to parry. (attn @rivkin @stovewithahouse @nepetro @marsmaven) https://t.co/fanw9ocd8p
asrivkin,trust_yes,@otherorbscience i honestly have no idea what to think. i believe you're right  but just having this conversation is insane.
jhjones,trust_yes,what's up sept? eclipses  meteors  planets + great sharables @nightskynetwork https://t.co/q7vrka57es https://t.co/4ybtlpzm6m
jhjones,trust_yes,@planetdr sending good wishes.

jhjones,trust_yes,i shared the whatsup talk i gave to your 5 sci classes in june with my 86 y/o dad &amp; 84  y/o mom this weekend  @mobriensmmusd &lt;3
jhjones,trust_yes,rt @mobriensmmusd @jhjones @nasa/jpl going to share your visit via @nasasocial and twitter @siemensstemacad #awesome!
jhjones,trust_yes,a whatsup podcast fan @ @astrosocietypac took a #selfie with me! i shared your #sciclass selfie / #wordle story  @mobriensmmusd
jhjones,trust_yes,rt @rtphokie @jhjones &amp; @mojo_la share @yosemitenps stars via @yosenaturenotes @yosemitesteve https://t.co/sb2sflpsid
jhjones,trust_yes,@mobriensmmusd can you share a few pix with me if possible???
jhjones,trust_yes,rt @sungrazercomets we're calling it  and you heard it here first: we believe some small part of #ison's nucleus has survived perihelion.
jhjones,trust_yes,@conartcritic @sungrazercomets where are you driving from? might have alternates  depending on comet's survival / height on your date.
jhjones,trust_yes,rt @susanbellfilm spacetweeps wish @jhjones happy 10th jpl anniversary!!!!! you do awesome work w/ @cassinisaturn! :) (♥thks  time flies! )
jhjones,trust_yes,rt @nasainsight mission to mission good wishes! banner signed by @nasainsight team @nasajpl to @maven2mars team http://t.co/1ww0pqgvoz
jhjones,trust_yes,nice end to a busy week- bumping into @marsroverdriver on the way to @mojo_la's carpool &amp; getting to wish him well + farewell.
jhjones,trust_yes,thks   @d_l_miller @sciteachermike i try to connect with 1 teacher each #nasasocial4yrs @ share @nasa edu not just once  but ongoing
drphilmarshall,trust_yes,.@brendonbrewer some say science is about truth and religion is about belief  but i think the exact opposite would be more accurate
drphilmarshall,trust_yes,the suli program summer interns at @slaclab are giving some truly impressive research talks. very hard to believe they are undergrads.
drphilmarshall,trust_yes,@mrtommyb great  thanks tom! @physicsdavid i hope you are following this. let's estimate some tsurface values  and see if we want to visit!
drphilmarshall,trust_yes,@brendonbrewer haha! you have adopted my approach to understanding probabilistic graphical models :-) @davidwhogg @chgreer @astrodrian
drphilmarshall,trust_yes,@kirkdborne but this implies twitter shouldn't be used as a filter. if my trusted voices can't be trusted  it's a noisy channel at best...
drphilmarshall,trust_yes,the internet enables image sharing; @a_kapadia and @astronomyblog enable quantitative analysis of those images #js4astro @augustmuench
drphilmarshall,trust_yes,@kevinschawinski @karenlmasters @galaxyzoo capak simply colored in the hst images. i'm advocating slower  sharper joint image reconstruction
drphilmarshall,trust_no,@kevinschawinski thanks! great to see the galaxy story on the front page of  the online guardian this weekend :-)

cosmic_horizons,trust_no,@brendonbrewer lack of positions due to doddery old unproductive professors staying rather than going  is an issue.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@cosmicpinot @sarahkendrew @drarnakarick i agree! but people must understand this when coming in door  not only while going out.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@startswithabang @bstorax @rmathematicus no  there via not a scientific method other than wish you-washy idealism.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@tokteacher @brendonbrewer @bluebearsoup yes  i understand you are wedded to the idea  but many are not. it feels right to you.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@broadly @bencubby i believe in aliens (but not that they have visited here). does that make me a celebrity?
cosmic_horizons,trust_no,@strom_m @mikeyslezak there would not be an issue if stories presented the data  statistical uncertainty &amp; explain what they mean.
cosmic_horizons,trust_no,@merrickphillip poor use of if statements (common in astro) conflicting with branch predictors - leads to poor efficiency!
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@mjibrown yeah  but i get cross with “holier than thou”s laughing at others with regards to their scientific understanding.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@abcnewsbrisbane @abcnews well done! i wish i could join him in donating  but being a brit  i am barred.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@bradpholden @_sarahmartell_ usually it's a committee discussion so a captain's pick doesn't normally work. need to produce ranked list.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@brendonbrewer @davidwhogg @aucklanduni i wish we could wipe the slate clean with academic writing and start again…
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@brendonbrewer but which half depends upon the audience!
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@ad_mico @mjibrown @airminded we get more than our fair share in cosmology…
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@michelle_lmc @dudedarkmatter imho understand it &amp; understand the choices. it is your money they are playing with.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@michelle_lmc i'm now old enough to care. wish i had cared more a decade ago to understand what was going on.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@michelle_lmc my understanding of those that object to relativity is that they simply don't understand it.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@brendonbrewer your definition of belief (based on evidence) and the accepted version (i just feel this way) are somewhat different.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@drbenjaminhabib @breakfastnews i'm terrified every single time. i completely understand and wish you the best.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@brendonbrewer so it does depend upon what their opinion is. hence some may wish to remain masked.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@drg_physics nope. in physical distance  it asymptotes to a fixed value.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@brendonbrewer i just remember compiler dependent issues on how functions were referred. it was painful  but fun to do. maybe it is easier
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@strom_m i never said it wasn't. what i said was that everything comes with a relative risk. this is the important thing to understand.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@strom_m but cancer is not binary. there are  relative risks associated with everything  and we are poor at understanding these.
cosmic_horizons,trust_yes,@markapple @aaoastro i believe it will be recorded - will publish details when i have them.
cosmic_horizons,trust_no,@dudedarkmatter @grumpykelson @jbprime even that is uncertain  especially if you're just a brain in a jar (of beer?)
cosmic_horizons,trust_no,@grumpykelson @jbprime @dudedarkmatter time is what clocks measure (with an uncertainty)
cosmic_horizons,trust_no,@grumpykelson @jbprime @dudedarkmatter all information arriving in your mind comes with an uncertainty.  some uncertainties are very small
cosmic_horizons,trust_no,@grumpykelson @jbprime @dudedarkmatter a level of subjectivity comes in to it - what is "reasonable doubt" for evidence. this is subjective.
cosmic_horizons,trust_no,@grumpykelson @jbprime @dudedarkmatter "fact" are not absolute  but come with uncertainties  and so nothing can be absolutely ruled out.
cosmic_horizons,trust_no,@reasther @brendonbrewer seeing a lack of discussion of publication stats  relative to others etc up front looks like hiding something
michael_w_busch,trust_yes,@sondy if i count correctly  over the entire lifetime of dps  all but 4 of the people ever on the committee have been white.  not cool.
michael_w_busch,trust_no,@sondy i find conflicting reports about the extent of that.  but shipping it a quarter of the way around the world isn't cheap in any case.
michael_w_busch,trust_yes,.@astrokatie @allplanets @exploreplanets my understanding was that transits by proxima b haven't been ruled out  but are unlikely (~1.5%) ?
michael_w_busch,trust_yes,@elsisrad may the new radial velocity values help figure out what's going on.
michael_w_busch,trust_yes,@fanny57 again  knowledge gained from studying other planets gives better understanding of weather &amp; climate on earth.
michael_w_busch,trust_yes,@sondy @planetdr @drmrfrancis @drfunkyspoon [ looks up offender ] the shared blocklist has already blocked him.  well done  blocklist.
michael_w_busch,trust_yes,@asteroidenergy depends on what counts as "mining".  arrm gives 20-50 tons raw materials.  arcm could include water extraction demo  etc.
michael_w_busch,trust_no,@cathomas09 if you send me a link to the paper concerned  i can see if i can make sense of it.
michael_w_busch,trust_no,@robminchin @sondy [ clicks ] "we are experiencing higher than normal volume and are unable to service your request at this time"  hmm...
michael_w_busch,trust_yes,@sondy depends entirely on where we put the lower size limit  and on how we do the averaging.
michael_w_busch,trust_yes,@motherboard @hubbahubble gertz was formerly chair of the seti institute _board of trustees_.  he no longer is: https://t.co/5pbrcbldp7 .
michael_w_busch,trust_no,@kumokasumi @sondy lack of universal healthcare kills: https://t.co/fribv4nhqr .
michael_w_busch,trust_no,@sondy @kat_volk @nolatredd @yeqzids [1/2] dss-43+parkes doesn't have that problem (although cbr traffic pattern is a concern). ...
michael_w_busch,trust_yes,@sondy there are case reports. it depends on how much bergamot is consumed &amp; on kidney function. i'd rather not be a test case myself.
michael_w_busch,trust_no,@weatheronmars @megschwamb for relevant expert commentary  the guardian should have asked @amyjlovell or other comet radio experts.
